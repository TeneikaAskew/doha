He also mitigated financial\nsecurity concerns arising from less than $4,000 in delinquent debts. He earns $55,000 per year since\nhis graduation. He paid one of the major debts six months before the hearing and entered negotiation\nfor the remaining two which now total less than $3,000. He also mitigated allegation of failure to\nreport as use of an alias the use of a friend\u2019s drivers license without his permission when his own\nlicense was suspended. He credibly established that this was not a deliberate omission. Clearance\nis granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn September 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a\nhearing. The matter was assigned to me on January 8, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on\nJanuary 10, 2007, for a hearing on January 26, 2007, and held that day. The government and\nApplicant each offered nine exhibits into evidence, and all were accepted. The record was left open\nfor 30 days. Applicant offered three additional exhibits that were admitted without objection. The\ntranscript was received on February 6, 2007 \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted some and denied some of the SOR allegations relating to criminal\nconduct, delinquent debts, and personal conduct with explanatory information for all. After a\ncomplete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old engineer who has worked for a major defense contractor since\nAugust 2005 after he graduated from a leading U.S. engineering school with an outstanding\nacademic record. He had a double major in aerospace engineering and physics and is working on a\nmasters degree while being employed full time. He intends to get a Ph.D. \nApplicant had drug arrests involving possession of marijuana in 1998 when he was 17 years\nold and in 2002 when he was 21. The later arrest also involved use of another person\u2019s drivers\nlicence and placing false information on official documents. He admitted both these arrests and\nincidents. He paid fines for both matters (Exh. G). He was also arrested in 1999 when he was 18 and\ncharged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest, making \u201cterroristic threats\u201d and disorderly conduct.\n\n3\nThis incident grew out of a dispute with a girl friend whom he threatened to kill. He plead and was\nfined $253 for one count of resisting arrest. \nApplicant was alleged in the SOR to have four delinquent debts totaling nearly $4,000\nincurred during his student years. He is contesting the smallest debt of $102 for a telephone bill\n(SOR \u00b6 1.2.a.) but will pay the debt if it cannot be resolved. He has been in contact with the credit\ncard creditors for two delinquent debts of $1,849 and $877 (SOR \u00b6 1.b and c.) He paid the fourth\ndelinquent debt of $1,452 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) six months before the hearing (Exh. E). He has paid several\nother delinquent debts including fines and court costs not alleged in the SOR over the past years both\nbefore and since his present employment. These amounted to several thousand dollars in excess of\nthose alleged in this matter (Exhs. 7, E, and I).\nApplicant used a friend\u2019s drivers license without his permission in connection with his 2002\narrest (SOR 1.a.). He did not have a valid license at that time because his had been suspended for\ntraffic violations. He did not state this use of another\u2019s name on his Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations (e-QIP) processing for a security clearance in 2005 in response to a question about\nusing names other than his own as an alias as he did not interpret this conduct as using an \u201calias\u201d.\nApplicant\u2019s background indicates a long struggle with family adversity. He and his brother\nwere principal care-givers for their mother who was a single mother who suffered from mental\nproblems. They literally raised themselves. Applicant had behavioral difficulties in his youth with\nanger and authority figures. He dropped out of high school in his senior year but obtained his GED\nand was admitted to college through a state sponsored special program for educationally and\nfinancially disadvantaged students who show promise. Both he and his brother are graduate\nengineers and excelled even beyond the program\u2019s expectations. Both have radically changed their\nlife-style and have promising careers ahead of them (Exhibit C Post hearing submission). \nThe annual salary of Applicant is $55,000. He has no dependents but continues to provide\nfinancial assistance to his mother. His financial obligations consist primarily of monthly rent of $825\nand payments on a three year old auto of $512 per month. He has school loans that are deferred\npending completion of his graduate studies. He has adequate funds to resolve his remaining\noutstanding delinquent debts and is in the process of doing so. He has been in touch with financial\ncounseling services but has not yet engaged their services (Exh. B Post hearing submission).\nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisor (Exh. C) who deem him to be an excellent and\nwell motivated employee. His academic supervisors and deans at his university submitted strong\ncharacter and professional recommendations for him extolling his record of achievement, motivation,\nand good character (Exhs. A, B, and Post hearing submission C). In addition to his graduate studies,\nhe serves as a tutor for other students at his university. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\n\n4\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify applicant from being eligible for access to classified information See\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nSecurity concerns were raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) over the three arrests\nthat occurred four to eight years ago. The allegations could be mitigated by the fact that the criminal\nbehavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1.), the factors leading to the violations are not likely to recur\n(E2.A10.1.3.4), and there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (E2.A10.3.6.). He\nacknowledged his responsibility for the offenses, paid fines and has since changed his life style and\nno longer associates with the same people with whom he knew during that period. I conclude\nApplicant\u2019s behavior and is mitigated by the passage of time, his lack of contact with those with\nwhom he knew in college and his successful rehabilitation. \nApplicant\u2019s four delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concern under\nGuideline F since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence\nof inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) \nMitigating Conditions (MC) include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (E2.A6.1.3.3.), the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\n\n5\nunder control (E2.A6.1.3.4.), and the person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.). \nThe evidence that the debts resulted from conditions beyond his control include the fact that\nthey accumulated during his youthful student days when he had limited income, financial\nrequirements, and more credit cards than he could manage. He has repaid one of the two\nlargestdelinquent debts as well as other large debts he incurred in his college years. He has not\nengaged credit counseling although he indicated he had a need for those services at the hearing and\nin his Post Hearing submission Exh. B. He has been in touch with credit counselors but has not\nfinalized their services. He intends to do so no matter the outcome of this matter because he\nrecognizes that he needs to achieve a good credit rating for future endeavors. \nApplicant acknowledged having made financial mistakes and agreed that he must resolve the\nremaining debts. He has initiated good faith efforts to repay the creditors and has reduced the\ndelinquent debt substantially with only approximately $2,700 remaining to two creditors with efforts\nto settle or pay those. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his use of another person\u2019s drivers license when he was 21years\nold as his use of an alias on his e-QIP raised issues under Guideline E that might indicate\nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and\ncould indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.).\nSpecifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from\na personnel security application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.)\nWhile the arrest relating to drug possession and use of a false drivers license in 2002 were\nserious offenses for someone who had reached maturity, he was found guilty and punished for them\n(Exh. 7). Whether he should have realized that the use of the improperly obtained drivers license in\n2002 would be deemed by the government as use of an \u201calias\u201d when filling out his form is\nproblematic. I find his testimony that he had no intent to falsify to be credible (Tr. 66-67). Thus, I\nconclude that the omission of an admission about use of an alias on the application was not\ndeliberate as required by the guideline and thus mitigated. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\nestablished that he is now a hard-working professional whose juvenile conduct several years ago is\nnow behind him. His debts accumulated during his student days to the point that he had lost control\nand account of them but will resolve them satisfactorily now that he has the financial means to do\nso. The impressive submissions from his corporate supervisor and his advisors at his university speak\nextremely well of him as a person of growth and character. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\n\n6\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude a security clearance should be granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

One occurred in 2002 and the\nother in 2005.  Based on his history, they are an aberration and not indicative of a pattern.  He has\ntaken full responsibility for his actions, and has taken steps to make sure that such acts do not occur\nin the future.  He presents a considerable amount of mitigating evidence that show support for his\nrequest for access to classified information.  The Applicant has mitigated the case against him.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 12, 2006, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on December 15, 2006, and a Notice of Hearing\nwas issued on January 5, 2007.\nA hearing was held on January 25, 2007, at which the Government presented two\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted nine exhibits.\nThe transcript was received on February 6, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 26, single and has a Bachelor of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol abuse).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has had alcohol related incidents away from work.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\n\n3\nThe Applicant has been arrested twice for alcohol-related driving offenses.  The first arrest\noccurred in January 2002, after the Applicant was involved in a motorcycle accident.  He plead guilty\nto the offense.  As a result, his driver\u2019s license was temporarily suspended, he was placed on three\nyears probation and he had to attend a three month drinking and driving program.  He successfully\ncompleted all of the court\u2019s requirements.  (Transcript at 26-29, 34-35.)\nThe Applicant was arrested a second time for Driving Under the Influence in February 2005.\nOnce again, the Applicant took complete responsibility for his actions and plead guilty to the offense.\nHe served 40 days of a 60 day jail sentence, attended an 18 month drinking and driving program,\npaid fines, attended victim panels, was put on five years probation and signed away his driver\u2019s\nlicense for two years.  During those years without a license the Applicant rode a bicycle to work and\nschool.  (Transcript at 29-32, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)\nAt the time of the second arrest, the Applicant was applying for his current job.  One of the\nresults of this arrest was the necessity of telling his employer about this second arrest during the\nmiddle of the hiring process.  (Transcript at 30.)\nThe Applicant continues to drink in moderation, but he does not drink and drive at all.  He\ndoes this because it is a requirement of his probation, and because he simply does not feel the need\nto drink to excess.  He may drink once a month, if that much.  (Transcript at 33, 39-41.)\nThe Applicant testified in a frank and forthright manner about his alcohol-related arrests, his\nsentences, what his current drinking pattern is, and what he expects it to be in the future.  He takes\nfull responsibility for his actions, and for the results. \nMitigation.\nThe Applicant is a well-respected young man and employee.  He submitted letters from three\nco-workers, all superior to him in rank and experience.  These people find the Applicant to be\nthoughtful, conscientious and mature.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nOne of these people, the Director, Studies & Analysis at his employer states, \u201c[The\nApplicant] is one of the brightest young men I have ever met.\u201d  She goes on to state:\n[The Applicant] is very mature and has wisdom beyond his years. . . .  He made a bad\nchoice several years back, but has learned a great deal from the experience.  He\nhimself will look you in the eye and tell you that there was a lot of good that came\nout of his DUI. [The Applicant] has embraced the consequences, opened himself\ncompletely to accepting his actions and learned from his mistakes.  He will tell you\nthat the whole experience has made him a better person.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at\n1.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s former employer also submitted a laudatory letter.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nHe also submitted a letter from his girlfriend\u2019s father, who is also in the defense industry.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  Documentation from his employer shows that the Applicant is viewed as\nan exceptional employee.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E, F, H and I.)\n\n4\nThe Applicant is currently taking classes to earn his Master\u2019s degree.  One of his professors\nstates, \u201c[The Applicant\u2019s] work ethic, devotion and integrity are what we would like to see in all of\nour students.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na.\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb.\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\nc.\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.\nThe voluntariness of participation\nf.\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\ng.\nThe motivation for the conduct\nh.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\n\n5\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in alcohol related criminal conduct that demonstrates poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has two alcohol-related arrests, in 2002 and 2005.\nHe took, and takes, full responsibility for his actions.  His credible testimony was compelling and\nbelievable in this respect.  The evidence shows that these incidents were an aberration, and not\nindicative of his nature.  The Applicant was a young man at the time of both of these incidents.  He\nhas obviously matured, realized the impact alcohol has made on his life, and has made intelligent\ndecisions about its use in his future.\nUnder Guideline G, the following Disqualifying Condition applies: E2.A7.1.2.1 (Alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\nspouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use).  As described above, Mitigating\nConditions E2.A7.1.3.1. (The alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern) and E2.A7.1.3.3.\n(Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety) also apply and justify a finding for the\nApplicant under Paragraph 1.\nRegarding Guideline J, Disqualifying Conditions E2.A10.1.2.1. (Allegations or admissions\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and E2.A10.1.2.2 (A\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) apply.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\n\n6\nfollowing Mitigating Condition applies: E2.A10.1.3.1. (There is clear evidence of successful\nrehabilitation).  Paragraph 2 is also found for the Applicant.\nIn addition, application of the General Factors is appropriate and supports a decision in the\nApplicant's favor.  The Applicant has matured since the alcohol related incidents took place (factor\nd.), he shows considerable evidence of rehabilitation (factor f.), and, under the circumstances of this\ncase, the probability that the Applicant will engage in such conduct again are virtually nil (factor i.).\n  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of\nthe Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

CEFOLA\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant\u2019s last Drug Involvement, marijuana, is not recent, having occurred more than\n16 months ago.  He has also \u201csigned [a] statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance\nfor any violation.\u201d  When interviewed by an investigator, he was candid as to his past Drug\nInvolvement and Alcohol Consumption.  However, his continued excessive consumption of alcohol\nis problematic.  The Applicant last consumed the intoxicant, to the point that he was under its\ninfluence, in February of 2007, only three months ago.  Mitigation is not shown as to his Alcohol\nConsumption.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about December 18, 2006.\nThe case was originally assigned to another judge, but reassigned and received by the\nundersigned on March 27, 2007.  Pursuant to a request from the Government, a continuance was\ngranted, and an amended notice of hearing was issued on March 27, 2007.  The case was heard on\nApril 25, 2007.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the\nApplicant, who also  submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on May\n4, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's past Drug Involvement, alleged Personal\nConduct, and admitted Alcohol Consumption militate against the granting of a security clearance.\n[The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of most of the allegations, except for Paragraph\n3 of the SOR, as he denies any lack of candor during his interview by an investigator.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 29 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement & Guideline E - Personal Conduct\n1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about 1994, to his\nlast usage on December 31  2005 (TR at page 55 lines 3~17).  During the last year of his usage, he\nst\nused marijuana \u201c[o]nce every three months or less\u201d (TR at page 73 line 10 to page 74 line 2).  He\n\n3\nalso purchased marijuana on numerous occasions (Id).  He no longer associates with those with\nwhom he used drugs, and he has signed a statement of intent against any illegal Drug Involvement\nin the future (TR at page 81 line 18 to page 82 line 7, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) H, the last\npage, see also AppX B).\n1.c. and 1.d.  The Applicant used ecstacy, with varying frequency, from about 1994 to his last\nusage in March of 2000 (TR at page 55 line18 to page 58 line 25).  He used this hallucinogen about\n7~11 times a year (TR at page 74 lines 6~21, and Government Exhibit (GX) 3 at pages 10~11).  The\nApplicant also purchased ecstacy on numerous occasions (TR at page 55 line18 to page 58 line 25).\n1.e.  The Applicant used cocaine, with varying frequency, from about 1996 to his last usage\nin 1998 (TR at page 59 lines 1~4).  He used cocaine about once or twice a year (TR at page 74 lines\n22~24, and GX 3 at pages 10~11).\n1.f. and 1.g.  The Applicant used inhalants once or twice in 1998, and another hallucinogen,\npsilocybin, in 1997 (TR at page 59 line 5 to page 61 line 5, at page 75 lines 1~4, and GX 3 at page\n11).\n3.b.  When interviewed by an investigator in April of 2006, the Applicant mistakenly thought\nthat he was only required to disclose his drug usage in the last seven years, as this was what he was\nrequired to disclose on his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (QSP) (TR at page 69 line 20 to\npage 76 line 11, at page 77 line 19 to page 78 line 15, and GX 1 at page 9).  I find no wilful\nfalsification here.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption & Guideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.a. and 2.b.  The Applicant consumed alcohol to excess and to the point of intoxication from\nabout 1995 until about February of 2007 (TR at page 64 line 6 to page 65 line 1).  In January of\n2000, he was arrested and subsequently pled guilty to Dry Wreckless driving (TR at page 65 line 2\nto page 66 line 14, and GX 2).  The Applicant had consumed alcohol prior to this arrest (Id).  When\nthe Applicant drinks \u201csix to seven plus\u201d beers he feels under the influence of alcohol (TR at page\n75 line 20 to page 77 line 7).  He typically drinks on weekends during sporting events, and to the\npoint of intoxication \u201c3 to 6 times a year\u201d (TR at page 64 line 12 to page 65 line 1, and GX 3 at page\n2).\n3.a. When interviewed by an investigator in April of 2006, the Applicant was unsure of what\nthe term \u201cintoxicated\u201d meant; and as such, disclosed the date of his last alcohol related arrest (TR\nat page 66 line 15 to line 69 line 19, and at page 78 line 16 to page 80 at 6).  I find no wilful\nfalsification here.\nMitigation\nThose who know the Applicant think most highly of him (AppX C).\nPOLICIES\n\n4\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), G (Alcohol\nConsumption), and E (Personal Conduct); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an\napplicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with\nrespect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nA pattern of excessive Alcohol Consumption and illegal Drug Involvement raise questions\nregarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Unacceptable\nPersonal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The Government must be able to place a high\ndegree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at\nall times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then\nexists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and\nregulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nConsidering first the Applicant\u2019s past Drug Involvement, the Applicant  used marijuana, and\nto a lesser extent other drugs, from about 1994 until his last usage in December of 2005.  The first\nand third disqualifying conditions are therefore applicable.  There was \u201cdrug abuse,\u201d and  \u201cpurchase\u201d\nof illegal drugs.  However, I find the second mitigating condition is applicable here, as the Applicant\nhas a \u201cdemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d  He has disassociated himself from\ndrug-using associates, and has signed a statement of intent, acknowledging an automatic revocation\nof his clearance for any future violation.  Guideline H is found for the Applicant.\nConsidering next his Alcohol Consumption, there was a conviction in 2000, and continued\nexcessive consumption to at least February of 2007.  I find the first and third disqualifying conditions\napplicable, as there is an \u201calcohol-related incident away from work,\u201d and \u201cbinge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgement.\u201d  He consumes 6~7 beers on some weekends while\nwatching sporting events.  I can find no countervailing mitigating condition.  Guideline G is found\nagainst the Applicant.\nFinally as to his alleged Personal Conduct, I find no lack of candor here.  When interviewed,\nthe Applicant disclosed the information that was required by the QSP.  There was no intent to\ndeceive the Government.  Furthermore, he disclosed all of his past Drug Involvement and Alcohol\nConsumption six months later in response to written interrogatories (GX 3).  Guideline E is found\nfor the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding\nhis Alcohol Consumption.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guideline\nE, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of\npersuasion under Guideline E.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nb. For the Applicant.\nc. For the Applicant.\nd. For the Applicant.\ne. For the Applicant.\nf. For the Applicant.\ng. For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\na.

Consequently, concerns over financial issues can be mitigated.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on August 31, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR  alleges specific concerns over finances\n1\n2\n(Guideline F).  On September 19, 2006, Applicant request an extension until October 20, 2006, to\nsubmit his response which was granted by a Personnel Security Specialist.  Applicant responded to\nthese SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on October 18, 2006, where he admitted all the\nallegations with explanation and requested a hearing. \nSubsequently, Department Counsel filed a ready to proceed memorandum on January 3,\n2007. The case was assigned to me for hearing on January 8, 2007.  On January 17, 2007,  DOHA\nissued a Notice of Hearing and set this case to be heard on February 6, 2007, in a city near where\nApplicant works.  Department Counsel presented four exhibits (Exhibits 1-4) which were admitted\ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered three exhibits (Exhibits A-C), which\nwere admitted into evidence without objection.  With no objection from Department Counsel,\nApplicant was given thirty days to submit additional evidence by March 6, 2007; the Government\nhad seven days until March 13, 2007, to review the documents and submit a response.  (TR 32-33,\n92-93)  On March 6, 2007, Applicant submitted Exhibit D, a twenty-six page document which I\nforwarded to Department Counsel for review on March 11, 2007.  Department Counsel stated on\nMarch 16, 2007, that he did not object to Exhibit D.  Consequently, the Applicant\u2019s post-hearing\nexhibit was admitted; and the record closed on March 16, 2007.  The transcript (TR) was received\non February 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:\n\n3\nApplicant, who is 41 years old, has been employed by a defense contractors in State #1 as\na emergency operator for since January 2004.  He is a U.S. citizen; he completed a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86) in October 2005.  (Exhibit 1; TR 30-31; 34; 43-44)\nApplicant attended community college in 2003.  While he did not provide the date of his first\nmarriage, he has two children, ages 19 and 18, born in 1987 and 1988.  He has a third daughter born\nfrom another relationship in 1995 who is 11 years old.  He married Wife #2 in 1999 and separated\nin January 2001; he was divorced in 2006. He married Wife #3 in May 2006 and has an11 year old\nstep-daughter who lives with him; he and his wife expect another child in April 2007.  His oldest\nchild has had a child born in September 2006. (Exhibit 1; TR 34-41; 75; 80)\nFinances\nIn answer to questions on his financial record on the SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he had\nhis wages garnished  for child support in January 1997 for $400 monthly. (Exhibit 1)   Investigation\ndisclosed several adverse credit issues in credit reports.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 4) Applicant began having\nfinancial problems in 1997-98 when he and his first wife separated and divorced.  He was providing\nchild support for two daughters and was also providing support for a third daughter from another\nrelationship.  Also, he had medical bills.

The mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy\ncondition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this\ncase, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Concern:  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\n\n       Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: E2.A6.1.2.1.  A\n3\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; E2.A6.1.2.2.  Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan\nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; E2.A6.1.2.4.  Unexplained affluence; E2.A6.1.2.5.  Financial problems that are linked to gambling,\ndrug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.\n        Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: E2.A6.1.3.1.  The behavior was not recent;\n4\nE2.A6.1.3.2.  It was an isolated incident;  E2.A6.1.3.3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation);  E2.A6.1.3.4.  The person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol;  E2.A6.1.3.5.  The affluence resulted from a legal source; and E2.A6.1.3.6.  The individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nBecause of Applicant\u2019s (1) history of financial problems from 2001 to 2005 and his (3)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy all of his debts, the Government established disqualifying\nconditions  that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. At the time of the\n3\ninvestigation and at the time of the hearing, he had several unresolved debts that stemmed from\nconsumer debts, child support, student loans, and medical bills. Applicant delayed finalizing his\nplans to consolidate and pay these debts.  On March 5, 2007, he signed a legal services retainer\nagreement with a debt management firm to negotiate and consolidate his payments for his debts.\nEarlier he had submitted documentation as to which creditors would be included in the consolidation\nplan.  He submitted a copy of a money order paying a $24 debt to one creditor along with a statement\nthat he planned to pay off the remaining small creditors incrementally.  He also forwarded the child\nsupport records provided him by the state child support division.\nSince the delinquent debts have persisted, I cannot conclude that under MC1, the behavior\nthat led to his debts was not recent as he developed new delinquent debts as recently as 2005.  Under\nMC 2, the debts are not isolated as he developed multiple delinquent debts.  In evaluating whether\nor not MC 3 applies, I note the some of the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond his control (e.g., he did have uneven employment until 2004, and he did experience\nseparation and divorce during the 2001 to 2006 period with responsibility to pay child support for\nthree children.)  To his credit, Applicant has recently begun to make a systematic effort to resolve\nthese debts where he has been able to reach the creditor or identify the debt collector.  Thus,\nApplicant falls within several mitigating  conditions.  First, he has developed an overall plan: he\n4\nprovided evidence he will address a majority of the larger debts by the credit consolidation  plan and\nwill pay the smaller debts in full one by one.  To show his progress he submitted the consolidation\nagreement and a money order where he had paid one of the smaller debts.  He has had difficulty\nidentifying some debtors or the collection agency which seems endemic to dated debts.  \nWhile his take home pay is less than $2,000 per month, his wife\u2019s take home pay is $4,000\nper month, so they have sufficient disposable income to resolve these debts as she has stated she will\nhelp with their financial obligations.  They live prudently and have limited expenses.  While under\n\n       See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n5\n7\nMC 4, Applicant has not sought formal financial counseling for the problem, he did seek advice from\nhis pastor and assistance and advice from a debt consolidator.  He has authorized them to\nautomatically deduct the monthly debt payments directly from his checking account.  Also, he pays\nhis multiple child support payments directly from his salary.  So he has demonstrated his willingness\nto demonstrate his financial responsibility.\nThus, in March 2007 he provided evidence of clear steps that he was taking to begin to\nresolve his debts and to bring his finances under control.  Under MC 6, an individual needs to have\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  To mitigate\nApplicant does not have to have eliminated every debt, especially those debts for which he would\nnot be held responsible under the statute of limitations.  Overall, Applicant has demonstrated  that\nhe is now taking substantial steps to become financially responsible as he is following  through on\na plan to resolve these debts. Thus, Applicant has mitigated these financial concerns as he has\nprovided evidence that he has a orderly plan to resolve the identifiable debts.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix\n8.  While Applicant\u2019s debt problems resulted in part from voluntary decisions to purchase items and\nfrom other debts when he was underemployed before 2004, Applicant provided evidence of\nrehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline\nand the complete absence of new delinquent, unpaid debt since 2005. The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant has no mortgage payments as he rents, and has\nrefrained from using any personal credit cards.  He has demonstrated his greater awareness of\nfinancial responsibilities and this steps will lead to an improving trend of financial circumstances.\nMoreover, he has stability in his employment which should increase his net worth and establish a\nfinancial foundation for his future.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low.  At his\nplace of employment, he is viewed as a hard worker who is always looking to learn something new\nto advance his career.   Applicant now has sufficient resources to resolve these delinquent debts and\nhas developed a plan to do so.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the concerns\npertaining to financial considerations.  Substantial evidence supports Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability. I take this position based on the law, my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person\nfactors\u201d  and supporting evidence, as well as my application of the pertinent factors under the\n5\nAdjudicative Process. \nThus, after looking at the whole person, including his history of responsible conduct on the\njob since 2004, and also considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, I rule for Applicant under SOR Paragraph 1 as he mitigated the allegations in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.t.  \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make\nthe following formal findings:\nParagraph 1.

Evidence presented at the hearing established that\nnine debts were paid, and five were unpaid.  She testified that six additional debts were paid but\nproduced no evidence of payment.  She did not disclose the debts on her application for a\ntrustworthiness determination, but presented evidence that she had been overseas for a substantial\ntime and was unaware of her credit history.  She refuted the allegations of falsifying her application,\nbut she has not mitigated trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations.  Clearance is\ndenied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nfavorable trustworthiness determination. This action was taken under Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September\n1, 2006 (AG). The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial\nConsiderations), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 6, 2006 and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 9, 2007, and heard on July 19,\n2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open until August 6, 2007, to enable both sides to submit\nadditional evidence.  Department Counsel submitted additional evidence, and it has been admitted\nas Government Exhibit (GX) 6.  Applicant did not submit any additional evidence.  DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 52-year-old computer trainer.  She worked for a defense contractor from\nNovember 2004 to June 2007, and she submitted her application for a trustworthiness determination\nduring that period of employment.  She also owns a business involved in computer training.  The\ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a arose when she was unable to pay the rent on her office space (Tr. 57).\nApplicant is now working as an independent contractor, training employees of a private\nsector business.  A previous employer has asked her to work on a defense contract as soon as she\nfinishes her current 10-week project.  Her current private-sector project does not require a clearance,\nbut her previous (now future) employer requires her to have a clearance when she begins working\non the defense contract.  She has never held an ADP clearance.\nUntil October 2002, Applicant was the operations manager for a corporate staffing company,\nearning about $65,000 per year.  Her company went out of business as a result of the terrorist attacks\non September 11, 2001, and she was unemployed until April 2004.  In August 2004, she contacted\na credit counseling service, but her job ended in October 2004, and she terminated her relationship\nwith the service.  Her failure to continue working with the credit counseling service is alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.v.  As a result of her periods of unemployment, she incurred 20 delinquent debts.  The\nevidence regarding the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the following table.\n\n4\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nRecord\n1.a\nOffice rent\n$1,754\nPaid.\nGX 5; Tr. 91-92\n1.b\nCar repossession\n$7,811\nUnpaid; creditor\ndeclined Applicant\u2019s\noffer of installment\npayments.\nTr. 61-62\n1.c\nCell phone\n$1,410\nUnpaid.\nTr. 64\n1.d\nCredit card\n$1,449\nUnpaid.\nTr. 66-67\n1.e\nDamage to rental car\n$527\nDisputed, but\nApplicant provided no\ndocumentation.\nTr. 67\n1.f\nBad check\n$90\nApplicant testified it\nwas paid, but had no\ndocumentation.\nTr. 69-70\n1.g\nState taxes\n$579\nApplicant testified it\nwas paid, but had no\ndocumentation.\nTr. 70-71\n1.h\nCredit card\n$2,447\nPaid.\nGX 4 at 5; Tr 72\n1.i\nFurniture\n$3,380\nApplicant testified she\nwas making\npayments, but she had\nno documentation.\nTr. 73\n1.j\nCredit card\n$425\nPaid.\nGX 4 at 5; Tr. 75\n1.k\nCredit card\n$68\nPaid.\nSame as SOR \u00b6 1.j\n1.l\nComputer\n$1,003\nApplicant testified it\nwas paid, but had no\ndocumentation.\nTr. 77\n1.m\nTelephone bill\n$136\nApplicant promised to\npay within two weeks.\nTr. 78\n1.n\nBad check\n$106\nApplicant testified it\nwas paid, but had no\ndocumentation.\nTr. 78-79\n1.o\nCollection account\n$3,382\nSame debt as SOR \u00b6\n1.i.\nGX 4 at 4; Tr. 74\n1.p\nCable box\n$133\nPaid.\nGX 4 at 5; Tr. 79-80\n\n5\n1.q\nCredit card \n$1,296\nApplicant testified it\nwas paid, but had no\ndocumentation.\nGX 4 at 5; Tr 82\n1.r\nCredit card\n$1,061\nSettled.\nGX 4 at 5; Tr. 83-84\n1.s\nCredit card\n$763\nSettled.\nGX 4 at 5; Tr. 83\n1.t\nCredit card\n$1,159\nSettled.\nGX 4 at 5: Tr. 83\n1.u\nCredit card\n$1,577\nPaid.\nGX 4 at 5; Tr. 84\nApplicant incurred the cell phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d when she opened an account for her\nformer fianc\u00e9/companion.  He repeatedly promised to settle the account but has not.  The account\nhas been unpaid since September 2003.  At the hearing, Applicant promised to contact the creditor\nand settle the account (Tr. 64-65).  She provided no post-hearing evidence of settlement.\nApplicant disputed the debt arising from damage to a rental car (SOR \u00b6 1.e).  She denied\ncausing any damage to the car.  She provided no documentation of the dispute.\nI kept the record open until August 6, 2007, to enable Applicant to provide documentation\nthat the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.q were resolved.  At the hearing, she\npromised to provide documentation, but I received nothing from her. \nApplicant\u2019s contract with her current employer required worldwide travel.  She was working\nat various overseas locations, had been away from home for about six months, and had not seen her\ncredit report when she completed her security clearance application.  She depended on family\nmembers to forward her mail.  She returned from overseas in June 2006.  She denied intentionally\nomitting information about her debts from her application.\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines for security clearances are also used to make ADP\ntrustworthiness determinations.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right\nto the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may\nbe made.  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  Regulation\n\u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive\nduties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness\nare such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.\u201d  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  AG \u00b6 2(a).  Each\neligibility determination must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant\nand material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the adjudicative guidelines.  An\n\n6\nadministrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Id.  \nIn security clearance cases, the government must initially present substantial evidence to\nestablish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  \"Substantial evidence\" is \"more\nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\"  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36\nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nsecurity clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to\ntrustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F:Financial Considerations\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows:. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG\n\u00b618.\nA disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s financial history is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is \u201cindebtedness caused by\nfrivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  This condition is not raised, because there is\nno evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending.  Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts began\nwhen she lost her job.\nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d  This condition is not raised.  Applicant appears to have been living\nwithin her means when she incurred the debts.  When she lost her job, she was no longer able to pay\nthem.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 19(g) is raised by \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as\nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d  Although applicant owes the state taxes alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.g, the record reflects that she filed a return, and there is no evidence of fraud.  I conclude\nAG \u00b6 19(g) is not raised.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR\nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This condition is not established because Applicant had multiple\ndelinquent debts, some of which are still unresolved.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nApplicant\u2019s loss of employment established the first prong.  However, she returned to the work force\nalmost three years ago and still has not resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.m.\nShe promised to provide documentation showing resolution of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g,\n1.i, 1.l, 1.n, and 1.q; but she provided nothing, even though the record was kept open to enable to\ndo so.  I conclude the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).\nApplicant resolved several of her delinquent debts, but others remain unresolved.  Her failure to take\nadvantage of the opportunity to present post-hearing evidence suggests a lack of a sense of urgency\nin righting her financial ship.  I conclude this condition is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(e).  Applicant testified that she disputed the damage to a\nrental car alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but she offered no documentation of the dispute and no evidence of\nher actions to resolve the issue.  This condition is not established.\nThe record reflects that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.o are the same debt.  When the\nsame conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative\nallegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep.\n21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.o. in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\n\n8\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15.  \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  AG \u00b6 16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the\nomission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for omitting mention of her delinquent debts on her application is\nplausible.  Having considered all the evidence, heard her testimony, and observed her demeanor, I\nconclude she did not intentionally falsify her application.  If her haphazard approach to her hearing\nin this case is any indication, the omissions from her application were more likely the product of\nhaste and inattention than any intent to conceal or deceive.  I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is not raised,\nand no other disqualifying conditions under this guideline are raised.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 30.  Conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(a).\nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, to\nknowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the\nUnited States.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  Security clearances are matters within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive branch of the government of the United States.  A deliberately false answer on a security\nclearance application is a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline J.  For the reasons set out\nunder Guideline E above, I conclude Applicant did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  No disqualifying\nconditions under this guideline are raised.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the general adjudicative guidelines in the Regulation.  I have\n\n9\nconsidered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nApplicant is a mature, articulate, well-educated adult.  At the hearing, she presented herself\nas a high-energy, fast-moving, multitasking woman.  She has good intentions, but has not expended\nthe time and attention required to repair her bad credit.  She remains vulnerable to pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, E, and J, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has rebutted the\nallegations under Guidelines E and J, but she has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based\non financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that\nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant her a favorable trustworthiness\ndetermination.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

On August 17, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 29, 2006, after the hearing,\n\n2\nAdministrative Judge James A. Young denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings;\nwhether the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application\nwas deliberate; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines E and J had not been mitigated.\n(1) Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in findings that Applicant\u2019s criminal offenses were\ncommitted at his girl friend\u2019s house, when in fact the lease for the house was in his name as well as\nhis girl friend\u2019s name.  However, even if the challenged finding was changed to reflect Applicant\u2019s\ninterpretation of the record evidence, it would not have undermined the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nTherefore, any such error would be at most harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 05-08459 at 2, n.1 (App.\nBd. Nov. 16, 2006).  Applicant also asserts that the Judge erred in finding Applicant had committed\ntwo of the criminal offences alleged in the SOR because the charges for both were eventually\ndismissed.  In this regard, Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern do not reflect a reasonable\nor plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  A Judge can find an applicant has engaged in criminal conduct even if the criminal charges\nagainst the applicant were dropped or dismissed.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11906 at 3 (App. Bd. July\n19, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-21761 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2005).  Considering the record as a\nwhole, the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct reflect a reasonable\ninterpretation of the record evidence and are supported by substantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 03-21933 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2006).\n(2) Applicant also contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose that he had been arrested on five criminal charges in 2002 and one\ncriminal charge 2003.  In support of this contention, he argues that the omission of the information\nwas due to a misreading the question, and he subsequently provided the correct information.\nApplicant has not demonstrated that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\nThe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification were not necessarily overcome by\nApplicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJan. 22, 2004).  \n\n3\n(3) Finally, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised by his disqualifying conduct had not been mitigated.  With respect to the falsification of his\nsecurity clearance application, Applicant argues that the Judge should have found the disqualifying\nconduct mitigated, as a matter of law, because the conduct was an isolated incident; it was not recent;\nit was not likely to recur; and Applicant had subsequently provided the correct information\nvoluntarily.  With respect to his criminal conduct  Applicant argues the Judge should have found the\ndisqualifying conduct mitigated, as a matter of law, because two of the charges resulted in\ndismissals; the conduct was unsubstantiated; the conduct was an isolated incident; the conduct was\nnot likely to recur; and Applicant was pressured to commit the conduct.  The Board does not find\nthese arguments persuasive.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the\nevidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuidelines E and J is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted all the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F cited in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 52 years old and has worked as a logistics technician for a defense contractor since June 2004.

On October 23, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\n1\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised\n2\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn December 21, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 28,\n2007, scheduling the hearing for March 14, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the\nhearing, the Government submitted four exhibits (Exs. 1-4) and Applicant submitted four exhibits\n(Exs. A-D), all of which were admitted into the record without objection. The record was left open\nuntil March 28, 2007 to give Applicant time to submit additional documents. By memorandum dated\nMarch 27, 2007, the Government forwarded five additional documents submitted by Applicant,\nwithout objection. These documents were identified as Exs. E-I  and admitted. The transcript (Tr.)\n3\nwas received on March 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under\nGuideline F cited in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d. Those admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 52 years old and has worked as a logistics technician for a defense contractor\nsince June 2004. She was married in June 1983 and divorced in May 2002. She has a grown adult\ndaughter, as well as an adult stepdaughter that Applicant raised from the age of six.  Applicant is a\n4\nhigh school graduate and attended a community college from February 2003 to April 2003.

B (Letter from IRS re: installment agreement, dated January 5, 2007, and other related documents).\n13\nShe had been paying the IRS $32.50 through a payroll deduction.  See Ex. B, supra, at 2. \nEx. B, supra, note 10, at 3-5.\n14\nTr. 39.\n15\nTr. 39.\n16\nTr. 54.\n17\n4\nannual salary is approximately $36,000.  In June 2006, she started a part-time job at a retail\n6\ndepartment store, and works one to two days a week, at a rate of $7 per hour.7\nOn June 20, 2001, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, with total assets of $7,950 and total\nliabilities of $52,701. This bankruptcy was discharged on October 1, 2001.  Prior to the bankruptcy,\n8\nshe did not have health insurance. She has severe asthma and was often in and out of the hospital.9\nHer hospital bills accumulated, along with other debts, and led her to file bankruptcy.\nIn 2002, Applicant lost her full-time job that she had worked at for 12 years. A year of\n10\nunemployment followed, which included unemployment insurance.  During this year, Applicant had\n11\nasthma, sleep apnea, and was hospitalized for her extreme weight. She then had gastric bypass\nsurgery.\nApplicant is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a federal tax lien in the\napproximate amount of $2,142 entered in about October 2002. There is another outstanding federal\ntax lien owed to the IRS in the approximate amount of $8,979 entered in about October 2002.\nApplicant has a payment agreement of $65 each month to pay off both liens.  However, she pays\n12\nthe IRS $50 each month through a payroll deduction.  Payroll deductions were made for the period\n13\nending January 31, 2007, February 15, 2007, and February 28, 2007.  These payments will continue\n14\nuntil 2009.  In 2009, she will have finished paying off her car note of $300 a month. That $300 will\n15\nthen be paid to the IRS toward her tax debt.  She believes she currently owes between $7,000 and\n16\n$8,000 to the IRS for the tax liens.17\nIn about November 2003, Applicant lost her job. Immediately thereafter, she was hospitalized\ndue to a severe asthma attack. She did not have any health insurance. Applicant is indebted to a\n\nEx.

On November 6,\n2006, Applicant received a letter from the hospital regarding her outstanding bill. The letter stated,\nin part: \u201cWe believe that you may be eligible for financial assistance with your hospital bills through\na special program established by [the hospital].\u201d  By letter dated March 12, 2007, the hospital\n18\ninformed her that based on her application for financial assistance, her application was approved for\na 75 percent reduction.  By letter dated March 13, 2007, the hospital informed her that she was\n19\n\u201cexpected to pay the remaining balance of $1,063.89 at $50 per month starting March 13, 2007.20\nOn March 13, 2007, Applicant made a credit card payment to the hospital. Every month on the 9th\nand 24th, a payment of $25 will be automatically deducted from her checking account and paid\ndirectly to the hospital.  A payment was made on April 9, 2007.  The final payment is due on April\n21\n22\n24, 2008.\nAlthough not an allegation in the SOR, Applicant proffered evidence that she has paid her\ndelinquent debt with the state through payroll deductions.  She paid approximately $319 until the\n23\ndebt of $1,201.96 was paid in full.24\nApplicant\u2019s mother testified as a character witness. She acknowledged that Applicant\ndeveloped asthma as an adult and had been hospitalized numerous times because of that condition.25\nHer mother indicated that Applicant also had sleep apnea as well as a weight problem.  She was\n26\naware that her daughter did not have health insurance during her last hospital stay, and incurred a\nhospital bill of more than $3,000.27\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n33\n6\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n28\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n29\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n30\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n31\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n32\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n33\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, together with the whole-person concept, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nFinancial considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The\n\nTr. 33.\n34\nTr. 34.\n35\n7\nGovernment has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations.\nApplicant filed for bankruptcy in 2001. She is indebted to the IRS on two federal tax liens,\ntotaling $11,121. She also is indebted to a hospital for $3,482. Thus, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate financial considerations. In 2002, Applicant lost her full-time\njob that she had worked at for 12 years.  A year of unemployment followed.  During this year,\n34\n35\nApplicant had asthma, sleep apnea, and was hospitalized for her extreme weight. She then had\ngastric bypass surgery. In about November 2003, Applicant lost her job. Immediately thereafter, she\nwas hospitalized due to a severe asthma attack. She did not have any health insurance. Applicant\nowes $3,482 to the hospital. She also has two tax liens with IRS for $11,121. However, she has\nentered a payment plan with the IRS. She also has entered a payment plan with the hospital. Based\non those facts, Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) and FC MC 20(c) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply. Applicant has\nmitigated the Government\u2019s case. Allegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are found for Applicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nhas been plagued with health problems that required hospitalization during a time when she had no\nhealth insurance. A hospital bill was delinquent until she received a reduction in the debt based on\nher meager earnings. Two federal tax liens are now in the process of being paid off due to her\npayment arrangements with the IRS. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising\nfrom her financial difficulties. Based on the evidence of record, it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant\nis suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

On August 16, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR paragraph 1.c.  That favorable finding is not at issue\n1\non appeal.\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On December 29, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline B had not been mitigated.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline B had not been mitigated.    In support of that contention, Applicant essentially restates\n1\nthe facts of his case and argues that the Judge misweighed the evidence, by failing to given adequate\nconsideration to the favorable evidence.  Based upon the record as a whole, Applicant asserts that\nhis circumstances were not of sufficient seriousness to be of security concern.  As part of his appeal,\nApplicant offers new evidence in the form of a statement as to what additional steps he has been\ntaking to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns and citations to web sites supportive of his\nposition.  Applicant also cites to several DOHA Hearing Office decisions in which applicants in\nostensibly similar circumstances had been granted a clearance.  Finally, Applicant emphasizes the\nfact that his employer submitted a letter of compelling need for his continued services.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005).\nThe Board has previously noted that a decision by another Hearing Office Judge is not legally\nbinding precedent on that Judge\u2019s colleagues in other cases, even if an applicant can establish close\nfactual similarities between the cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31,\n2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile her decision in this case with\nthe decisions of her fellow Judges in ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752\nat 3 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006). \n \nThe Board has also noted that the security concerns raised by an applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances under Guideline B are not mitigated by whether the applicant possesses a technical\nability that could be useful to a Department of Defense contract or project.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n03-04090 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2005).\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\n\n3\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors.  Although she found in favor of Applicant with respect to one\nof the factual allegations, she reasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating evidence\nto overcome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.\nThe favorable evidence cited by the Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June\n29, 2005).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision\nunder Guideline B is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on August 25,\n2005. On November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under the criminal\nconduct, drug involvement, and personal conduct guidelines. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 4, 2007, and requested that a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s file of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the Government evidence in support of the allegations of the\nSOR) was sent to Applicant on September 12, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on\nOctober 2, 2007. Applicant\u2019s response was submitted on November 27, 2007, and\nJanuary 16, 2008\n\n The charges were carrying a concealed weapon (CCW), a felony, and possession of marijuana , a misdemeanor.\n1\n Presumably, Applicant is referring to his SCA (Item 4) he signed on August 25, 2005. However, the SCA reflects\n2\nhe answered \u201cYES\u201d to question 23.a. (Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?).\n2\nreceived on December 5, 2007. Department Counsel was notified on December 6, 2007\nby the DOHA administrative staff that the response was received, and officially\nacknowledged there would be no objection to Applicant\u2019s response. The case was\nassigned to me for decision on December 17, 2007.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 36 years old and has worked for his employer since 1991. He began\nas a production lead and was promoted in January 2005 to supply chain\nmanager/logistics specialist. He seeks a security clearance. \nCriminal Conduct. Applicant admitted both charges  in subparagraph 1.a. of the\n1\nSOR. Plea negotiations resulted in the CCW charge being reduced to a misdemeanor\nwhile the marijuana charge was dropped. The weapon was discovered in the driver\u2019s\ndoor compartment after he was stopped for speeding on September 1, 1995. The\nmarijuana was found during a search of the car. \nApplicant had the gun in his car for protection. Four years later, he obtained a\nstate gun license. He does not carry a gun currently because he has children. In\nexplaining the ultimate disposition of the charges, Applicant stated, \u201cI was told by my\nlawyer at the time that the marijuana charges were dropped and the felony of the\nweapons charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and all I had to do was mail in a fine\nand forfeit the gun to the state of [Y]\u201d(Item 3). Applicant noted that he answered the\nfelony question \u201cNO\u201d  on his security clearance application (SCA) because he did not\n2\nknow a charge is not canceled or voided with the disposition of the case. \nDrug Involvement. Applicant denied he used marijuana until 2005 as alleged\nunder subparagraph 2.a. In his responses to interrogatories (Item 5) dated September\n25, 2006, he claims he made a mistake in responding to question 5 of the\ninterrogatories by stating that his last use of marijuana was September 1, 2005. He\nattributes the mistake to haste and not properly checking the answers before submitting\nthem. He meant to place the \u201c1995\" year in place of the \u201c2005\" year, because the earlier\ndate indicates when he was charged with the two crimes alleged in subparagraph 1.a.\nof the SOR. Furthermore, Applicant stated he took several drug tests since 1995, and\nhad to quit using marijuana to maintain his job. Also, Applicant requested in a cover\nletter (January 4, 2007) in his answer to the SOR that he had not been sent the\ninformation that supported the government\u2019s claim of his marijuana use after September\n1, 1995. \nEven though several of Applicant\u2019s responses in Item 5 (responses to\ninterrogatories) appear to be entered in the appropriate spaces, then traced over a\n\n3\nsecond time, there is no way for me to determine why he employed this procedure with\nsome of his responses and not others. Tracing his responses a second time could mean\nhe was trying to emphasize the accuracy of the entry, and that September 1, 2005 was\nactually the last time he used marijuana. An equally credible explanation is that his first\npen failed temporarily and he used a second pen to complete his interrogatory\nresponses. Having weighed Applicant\u2019s explanations, I find that he intended to write in\nthe date when he was originally charged with the two offenses. He negligently entered\nthe wrong year. Accordingly, I find Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use was in 1995.\nSubparagraph 2.a. and 2.b. are found in Applicant\u2019s favor. Subparagraph 2.c. was\nadmitted by Applicant, but mitigated by the passage of more than 12 years. \nPersonal Conduct. I find Applicant intentionally falsified his SCA on August 25,\n2005 (subparagraph 2.a.) by denying he had ever been charged with an offense related\nto alcohol or drugs. I do not accept Applicant\u2019s first explanation that he did not know the\ncharges stay with you whether reduced or dropped. Based on my findings under\nparagraph 2, subparagraph 3.b. is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. His drug use falls outside\nthe purview of question 24 (a) of his August 25, 2005 SCA because it was not within the\nlast seven years.\nApplicant was interviewed on January 27, 2006, and contacted by telephone\nbetween January 5, 2006 and May 1, 2006 (subparagraph 3.c.) and he did not disclose\nthe possession of marijuana charge resulting from his arrest in September 1995. He\nstated in explanation the reason he did not disclose the marijuana offense during the\ninterviews was, \u201cthe possession of marijuana was dropped along with the concealed\nweapons charges. With them being dropped, I thought that there was never formal\ncharges.\u201d (Item 5, response to question 3) I find he intentionally concealed the drug\noffense during the two interviews.\nApplicant attributed the undisclosed information to haste and/or not being aware\nof the permanence of a criminal record. \nApplicant has been employed by his employer for 16 years. His job consists of\ncompleting subassemblies for aircraft and managing personnel/suppliers in the\nmanufacturing and maintenance process. He is currently enrolled at an online university\nwhere he recently received an associate\u2019s degree in business. \nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding\nconsideration in making security clearance determinations. These conditions must be\nconsidered in every case along with the general factors of the whole person concept.\nHowever, the conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case\nnor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. \n\n A misdemeanor is generally defined as a minor crime less serious than a felony, and where the sentence is one year\n3\nor less, a fine, or both. A felony is a serious crime for which the sentence of one year or more may be imposed. \n4\nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions\nexist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may\ndisqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. See\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes\nthere is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria\nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App.\nBd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to\nthe applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at\n531; see Directive E2.2.2.\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nCriminal behavior creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment and willingness to\ncomply with laws. \nDrug Involvement (DI)\nUse of illegal drugs invites questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nConduct involving questionable judgment, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness. \nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nApplicant\u2019s conviction of the misdemeanor  of carrying a concealed weapon\n3\noffense and possession of marijuana (subparagraph 1.a.) falls within (DC) 31.a. (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses). However, the conduct is mitigated by\nthe passage of time. Therefore, CC mitigating condition (MC) 32.a. (so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, or good judgment) is applicable to find subparagraph 1.a. in Applicant\u2019s favor.\n\n As discussed below, my favorable finding under subparagraph 2.b. warrants a finding for Applicant under\n4\nsubparagraph 3.b. because he there has been no drug use since September 1995. \n5\nSubparagraph 1.b. alleges Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. 1001 by intentionally\nfalsifying questions 23(d) and 24(a)  of his August 25, 2005 SCA, and by failing to\n4\ndisclose the marijuana charge during an interview on January 27, 2006, and during a\ntelephone interview between January 5, 2006 and May 1, 2006. In order to establish a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, the falsifications must be material or capable of influencing\nan agency decision. Due to the passage of time, I conclude that the deliberate\nfalsifications are no longer material. Subparagraph 1.b. is found for Applicant. \nAssuming the falsifications are found to be material, then CC MC 32.a. provides\nsubstantial mitigation. CC MC 32.d. (there is successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) applies in part due to the positive character evidence supplied\nby Applicant. His academic record and good job performance weigh in his favor, even\nthough the two items of character evidence provide little insight into his pattern of\ndishonesty during the security investigation. Subparagraph 1.b. is resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nDrug Involvement (DI)\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement fits the definition of DI DC 25.a. (any drug use) and\n25.c. (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia). The infrequent drug use is\nmitigated by the passage of about 12 years and DI MC 26.a. (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or\ngood judgment). Subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCA on August 25, 2005 falls within PC\nDC 16.a. (the deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire to determine security clearance eligibility). Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nomission of his marijuana charge during an interview on January 27, 2006 and an\ninterview conducted between January 5 and May 1, 2006 invoke the application of PC\nDC 16.b. (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an investigator). The three elements of PC DC 16.a. are satisfied based on\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his drug charge from his SCA, an application form\nutilized by the government to determine security clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate omissions did not stop in August 2005. Between January and May 2006,\nApplicant continued to deny the marijuana charge. The three elements of PC DC 16.b.\nare satisfied based on the deliberate omission of relevant facts to an investigator. \n\n6\nI have carefully weighed the mitigating conditions under the PC guideline and\nhave concluded none apply. PC DC 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission or falsification before being confronted with the facts) is\ninapplicable because Applicant did not disclose the marijuana charge even after he\nknew or should have known his drug record was a security concern. Applicant did not\nadmit to the drug charge until September 2006 when he was specifically asked why he\nomitted the drug information. PC MC 17.c. (the offense was minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable due to the seriousness and recency\nof Applicant\u2019s falsifications. PC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused the untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) does\nnot apply either. Applicant only acknowledged his drug charge after trying\nunsuccessfully several times to conceal the information, and he has not received\ncounseling. Subparagraphs 3.a. and 3.c., and the PC guideline are found against\nApplicant. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nIn rendering my decision under the specific guidelines, I have considered this\ncase under the general concepts of the whole person. When Applicant committed the\ncriminal conduct in 1995, he may not have been aware about the nature and\npermanence of criminal records. Ten years later he may not have been aware of the\nimportance of full disclosure on an SCA. However, when he was contacted by the\ninvestigator between January and May 2006, he should have realized (at age 34) that\nhis drug record was a security concern. Rather than simply disclosing the marijuana\ncharge however, he chose to continue concealment of the information. Due to the\nrecency of his falsifications, insufficient time has passed to conclude he warrants\naccess to a security clearance. Applicant has mitigated the drug involvement concerns\nwith the passage of time. The passage of time and the lack of materiality of the\nunderlying criminal behavior has mitigated the criminal behavior. Applicant\u2019s academic\nrecord and job performance are insufficient to overcome the pattern of falsifications\nunder the personal conduct guideline.\nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\nParagraph 2 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): \nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 3.b.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 3.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Clearance is denied.\n\nThe SOR is erroneously dated January 27, 2006. Department Counsel disclosed the mistake to Applicant. Also,\n1\nApplicant confirmed that he received the revised guidelines (Tr. 4).\nExhibit 3, Memo from Site Commander to Commanding General, Regarding Applicant\u2019s Discharge, dated\n2\nOctober 18, 1993.\nExhibit A, Reference Letter, dated April 20, 2007.\n3\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order\n1\n10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as\namended and modified (Directive). Applicant answered it on February 27, 2007, and requested a\nhearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April\n6, 2007 for April 26, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled, and I received six government\nexhibits, one Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, I left the\nrecord open through May 7, 2007 for Applicant to submit additional exhibits. That day, he submitted\ntwo additional exhibits. Department Counsel did not object to their admissibility. I admitted them\nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C. DOHA received the transcript on May 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations contained in Paragraph 1 of the SOR. They are\nincorporated as findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 38-year-old married man with two children, ages 16 and 14 from a prior\nmarriage. He has a high school diploma, and has earned one year of college credits. He served in the\nU.S. Marines from 1988 to 1993. Because his performance in the Marines was unsatisfactory, he\nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions.2\nSince 1998, Applicant has worked in the contract mapping field. He has worked for the same\nemployer since 1998. According to his employer\u2019s facility security officer, he is \u201ca trustworthy\nemployee who can be counted on to uphold the rules and guidelines that come with holding a\nsecurity clearance.\u201d3\nIn the late 1990's, Applicant\u2019s first marriage began deteriorating, resulting in a divorce in\n2000. He has remained in protracted litigation with his ex-wife since thenover visitation and custody\nissues. Over the years, Applicant has spent more than $4,000 in attorney fees. Currently, he has\nphysical custody of one of his children.\n\nTr. 24.\n4\nTr. 25.\n5\nExhibit 2, Interrogatories, dated November 16, 2006.\n6\nTr. 26.\n7\nTr. 23.\n8\nAnswer at 2.\n9\n3\nApplicant remarried in 2001. In the fall of 2003, his wife injured herself, and was unable to\nwork for seven months.  Approximately five months later, Applicant was laid off for two months.\n4\n5\nThey were dependent on both incomes to make ends meet.\nBy June 2005, Applicant had accrued $15,000 in delinquent debt. He met with a Defense\nSecurity Service (DSS) agent in February 2006 to discuss, among other things, his financial\ndelinquencies. Approximately nine months later, the government propounded interrogatories\nspecifically listing each delinquency, and requesting him to provide proof of any efforts toward\nresolving them.  At that time, his progress toward resolving them was minimal.\n6\nCurrently, the amount of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt remains unchanged. Of the 25 bills that\nhe owes, 14 are for less than $150. With the exception of the delinquency listed in subparagraph 1.m,\nhe has neither satisfied nor made plans to satisfy any of them. \nAt the hearing, Applicant attributed his failure to make \u201can organized effort\u201d  to resolve his\n7\ndebts to ongoing problems with his ex-wife.  He pays the creditors to whom he owes delinquent\ndebts \u201cwhen they get a hold of [him].\u201d8\nApplicant did not list any of his debts in response to Question 38 (Your Financial\nDelinquencies - 180 Days - In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt?), and Question 39 (Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 days - Are you currently over 90 days\npast due on any debt(s)) of his security clearance application (SF 86). He thought he was only\nsupposed to list any recurrent monthly bills that were delinquent.  He disclosed a wage garnishment,\n9\na repossession, and two unpaid judgments, as required in response to other SF 86 questions. Also,\nin response to Question 43 (General Remarks Do you have any additional remarks to enter in your\napplication?), he discussed his financial problems at length.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions). These guidelines were revised on December 29,\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n10\n4\n2005, and the revisions were implemented for all statement of reasons issued after September 1,\n2006.\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n10\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s longstanding financial difficulties trigger the application of Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19 (a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\nFC DC c (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC 19 (e): consistent spending\nbeyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash\nflow, high debt-to-income ratio and other financial analysis. I have considered all of the mitigating\nconditions and conclude none apply. Applicant has been aware his delinquencies posed a security\nconcern since meeting with a DSS agent in June 2005; however, he has made no plans to satisfy\nthem. \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he lacks the income to satisfy the delinquencies has limited\nprobative value. Many of these debts have been delinquent for more than six years. Moreover, many\nare small bills less than $150.\nApplicant\u2019s contention that circumstances beyond his control are responsible for his\ncontinued financial indebtedness has similarly limited probative value. The 2000 divorce, his current\nwife\u2019s 2003 disability, and his 2004 unemployment substantially contributed to the accrual of his\nfinancial delinquencies. However, he has neither made plans to pay the remaining debts, nor\ndemonstrated the inclination to begin paying them. Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s responses to Questions 38, and 39 of his 2005 SF 86 raise the issue of whether\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\napplies. Applicant was fully forthcoming about his financial problems in response to other financial\nquestions on the SF 86. He elaborated further about his troubled finances in the \u201cgeneral remarks\u201d\nsection of the SF 86. Under these circumstances, his contention that he did not intentionally omit\nfinancial information from Questions 38 and 39 was credible. PC DC 16 (a) does not apply, and\nthere are no personal conduct security concerns.\nCriminal Conduct\nFor the reasons set forth above, Applicant\u2019s responses to Questions 38 and 39 do not\nconstitute falsifications under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant has made minimal effort to satisfy his delinquencies. Under these circumstances\nthe likelihood that his financial problems will continue remains unacceptably high. Evaluating these\nfacts in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude he has not mitigated the security\nconcern.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n -1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On November 16, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 11, 2007, after the hearing,\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline E is not at issue in this appeal. \n1\n2\nAdministrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \n1\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FIMC) is unsupported by record evidence and arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is unsupported by\nrecord evidence and arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC), becoming a U.S. citizen in December 2000.  He works for a defense\ncontractor.  Applicant\u2019s mother was born in the PRC but is a U.S. citizen who has worked for a\ndefense agency for many years.  She is divorced from Applicant\u2019s father and is married to a U.S.\ncitizen and former Army officer.\nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of the PRC.  Applicant speaks with him twice a\nyear, on his birthday and on holidays.  Applicant\u2019s grandfather is also a citizen and resident of the\nPRC, with whom Applicant has visited in 2001, 2002, and 2003.  Applicant speaks with his\ngrandfather twice a year, on his birthday and on holidays..  \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of the PRC, but a legal resident of the U.S. by virtue of marriage.\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with them\nby telephone two or three times a week, although Applicant does not speak with them.  Applicant\u2019s\nfather-in-law is a partner in a large Chinese law firm.  In 2004 and in 2005, Applicant\u2019s parents-in-\nlaw gave Applicant\u2019s wife gifts of $10,000 each year.  In 2006 they gave her $6,000 and, at the time\nof the close of the record, Applicant and his wife were expecting a gift of $50,000 for a down\npayment on a house.  \nThe Judge found that the PRC does not consider Chinese-Americans to be more vulnerable\nto approach than any other group.  The PRC is willing to exploit a targeted individual\u2019s feelings of\nobligation toward the PRC or toward family or friends who live there.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(a).  (\u201c[T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\n2\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.\u201d) \nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(f).  (\u201c[T]he value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is\n3\nsuch that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure\nthe individual.\u201d)\n3\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel has not expressly\nchallenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, though she cites other record evidence in support of her\narguments on appeal.   \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge explicitly applied two Guideline B mitigating conditions, FIMC 8(a)  and (f).\n2\n3\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis under 8(a) is unsustainable in light of\nsignificant contrary record evidence.  For example, although the Judge discussed the PRC\u2019s approach\n\nSee Government Exhibit (GE) 1, Department of States Background Note, April 2006, at 7; GE 2, Department\n4\nof State Report on Human Rights Practices, March 8, 2006, at 1.\nSee GE 1 at 14-15.  \n5\nSee, e. g., GE III, U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s Republic of\n6\nChina, January 1999, at 21-25.  \nSee GE IV, Intelligence Threat Handbook, June 2004, at 17.  \n7\n4\nto intelligence collection, Department Counsel cited the PRC\u2019s suppression of human rights; its\npractice of arbitrary arrest and detention;  its long-standing rivalry with the U.S. over matters such\n4\nas the status of Taiwan;  that the PRC targets the U.S. with active intelligence gathering activities,\n5\nboth legal and illegal;  and that it considers Americans of Chinese ancestry to be \u201cprime intelligence\n6\ntargets.\u201d   Insofar as one of the criteria addressed in the mitigating condition and the concern\n7\nparagraph is the nature of the foreign country, the evidence cited by Department Counsel is critical\nin evaluating whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion.  \nThe validity of Appeal Board precedent issued under an earlier edition of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines is an issue in this case.  The Board has previously held \u201c. . . a Judge cannot rely on\nlanguage from an earlier version of the Directive to justify the Judge\u2019s decision and that an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility must be adjudicated under current DoD policies and standards, not\npast ones. Similarly, the precedential value of Board decisions is affected to the extent those\ndecisions involve the interpretation of a provision of the Directive that is later revised or changed.\nStatements made by the Board in earlier decisions that are predicated on then-existing language in\nthe Directive cannot be simply assumed \u2014by a Judge or a party\u2014 to be applicable in later cases after\nthe pertinent provision(s) of the Directive have been revised or changed.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-\n17369 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2006); and ISCR Case No. 02-24254 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jun 29, 2004)\n(footnotes omitted).  Of course, some precedent remains completely valid in the face of changes to\nthe guidelines, because it is not dependent on the language of any specific guideline.  Other\nprecedent remains valid where the applicable language of the guideline is unchanged or the changes\nare not of sufficient magnitude to vitiate or overrule  the substance of the precedent.  However,\nBoard decisions cannot be relied on or followed to the extent they involve precedent predicated on\nlaw or DoD policy that changed after the issuance of those decisions. Quasi-judicial adjudications\nmust be made within the bounds of applicable law and agency policy, not without regard to them.\nSee, e.g., Croplife America v. Environmental Protection Agency, 329 F.3d 876, 882 (D.C. Cir. 2003)\n(administrative law judges cannot ignore agency policy in making rulings); Nash v. Bowen, 869 F.2d\n675, 680 (2d Cir. 1989)(administrative law judge is subordinate to head of agency or department in\nmatters of policy); Mullen v. Bowen, 800 F.2d 535, 540 n. 5 (6th Cir. 1986) (decisional independence\ndoes not relieve administrative law judge of the obligation to apply agency policy).  See  ISCR Case\nNo. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)(security clearance decisions must be based on current\nDoD policy and standards). Accordingly, no Board decision should be construed or interpreted\nwithout regard to the law and DoD policy applicable at the time the Board decision was issued.\nHere, Guideline B is at issue.  Guideline B was subject to extensive revisions in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  However, those prior Board decisions which are consistent with the\nrevised guidelines are still applicable.  For example, the new guidelines specify in paragraphs 6 and\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 4 (App. Bd. Fe. 1, 2002).  See also Note 8 above.\n8\nGE 2 at 1, 10.  \n9\nSee the testimony of Applicant\u2019s spouse: \u201c[M]y dad is considered rich in China . . . he\u2019s doing pretty good\n10\n. . . he\u2019s a partner in a big law firm, a private law firm.\u201d  Tr. at 50, 52.  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(b).  (\u201c[T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\n11\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d)\nDecision at 7.  \n12\n5\n8(a) that the country matters.  It follows that prior Board precedent which states that when the foreign\ncountry is hostile to the United States, an applicant bears a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d to show that neither\nhe nor his family members in that country are subject to influence by that country is still valid under\nthe new guidelines.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 8 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).  In light of\nthe above, Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s limited analysis of the PRC is\ninadequate and that she has not presented the full context of the strategic threat posed to the U.S. by\nthe PRC is persuasive.  \nDepartment Counsel also argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the nature of the\nrelationship between Applicant and his foreign relatives does not pose an unreasonable security\nconcern.  Department Counsel contends that such family relationships as are found in this case are\npresumptively close and that there is nothing in the record to rebut that proposition.   Indeed,\n8\nApplicant visited his father and grandfather on several occasions between 2001 and 2003 and\nmaintains telephone contact with them at significant times of the year.  Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s\nChinese wife speaks with her parents two or three times a week.  In light of record evidence that the\nPRC monitors mail, telephone, and electronic communications,  the contacts between Applicant\u2019s\n9\nwife and her parents raise security concerns which the record as a whole does not resolve.\nAdditionally, the Board notes that the apparent prominence of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law  heightens\n10\nthe Government\u2019s security concern, especially in light of Applicant\u2019s receipt of gifts expected to\nexceed $70,000.  While the Judge notes that Applicant is well-off himself, and, therefore, not\ndependent on his father-in-law for support, she does not address the adverse security consequences\ngifts of that magnitude from overseas relatives.  Furthermore, the Judge did not explicitly discuss\nFIMC 8(b).   However, she appears impliedly to have raised it in concluding that Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep\n11\nties to the U.S.\u201d militate against his acting on behalf of the PRC.  The Judge does not explain why\nApplicant\u2019s ties to his foreign relatives, to include the receipt of a substantial amount of money from\nhis father-in-law, are comparatively minimal, as this mitigating condition requires. \nAs mentioned above, the Judge also gave favorable application to FIMC 8(f), which\naddresses the mitigation of security concerns arising out of foreign interests.  Applicant owns no\nproperty in the PRC, though he has, as stated above, received gifts from his father-in-law.  The Judge\nconcluded that these gifts \u201ccould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure\u201d\nApplicant.   Given the totality of the record here, the Judge erred in giving FIMC 8(f) substantial\n12\nweight.  Given the record evidence, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not\nsustainable.  \n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

(Exhibit 1; TR 26) 3 Applicant, a 29-year-old employee, began working for a defense contractor (Employer #1) in State #1 in August 2004. In September 2004 he completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86). He was born in the Peoples Republic of China (China) and became a U.S. citizen in December 2000 and was issued a U.S. passport. (Exhibit 1; TR 41) While his mother and father were born in China, his mother initially came to the U.S. in 1985 on a student visa to get a master\u2019s degree. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1996. Applicant and his father joined her in 1988 when he was ten years old. Applicant received his education in the U.S. He has a B.S. and M.S. in engineering from a state university. (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 25; 28-29) Applicant\u2019s mother came to the U.S. from China in 1985 to attend school and earned a masters degree in education.

Also,\nApplicant\u2019s failure to register with the U.S. Selective Service at 18 was not a deliberate disregard\nof U.S. legal requirements. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on November 16, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\neligibility to Applicant that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over foreign influence\n1\n(Guideline B) in paragraph 1 and over Personal Conduct (Guideline E) in paragraph 2 based on the\nrevised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\n2\nthe Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.   Applicant replied to the SOR allegations\nin an Answer notarized on December 2, 2006, and requested a hearing.\nOn January 17, 2007, Department Counsel noted the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to another judge on January 24, 2007. Subsequently, a Notice of Hearing, issued on\nFebruary 22, 2007, set the matter for March 8, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works and\nlives.  On February 21, 2007, Applicant waived the 15 day notice requirement in the Directive.  (TR\n12)  The case was re-assigned to me on March 5, 2007, because of the unavailability of the previous\njudge.\nAt the hearing the Government withdrew part of SOR allegation 1.e. as Applicant did not\ntravel to China in November 2003; instead he traveled to Canada.  (Answer; TR 14-17)   The\nGovernment offered exhibits (Exhibits 1-2) which were admitted into evidence without objection;\nalso admitted was Exhibit 3 which included five documents for Administration Notice (AN)\n(Exhibits I-V).  (TR 12; 20-22)  Applicant testified, called two witnesses, but submitted no exhibits\nThe transcript (TR) was received on March19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact:\n\n       On his security form, he disclosed that his grandmother was a citizen of China and resided; however,\n3\nshe died in 2004. (Exhibit 1; TR 26)\n \n3\nApplicant, a 29-year-old employee, began working for a defense contractor (Employer #1)\nin State #1 in August 2004.  In September 2004 he completed a Security Clearance Application\n(Standard Form 86).   He was born in the Peoples Republic of China (China) and became a U.S.\ncitizen in December 2000 and was issued a U.S. passport.  (Exhibit 1; TR 41)\nWhile his mother and father were born in China, his mother initially came to the U.S. in 1985\non a student visa to get a master\u2019s degree.  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1996.\nApplicant and his father joined her in 1988 when he was ten years old.  Applicant received his\neducation in the U.S.  He has a B.S. and M.S. in engineering from a state university.  (Exhibits 1,\n2; TR 25; 28-29) \nApplicant\u2019s mother came to the U.S. from China in 1985 to attend school and earned a\nmasters degree in education. She and Applicant\u2019s father were divorced in 1989.  She went to work\nfor a defense language agency in 1992 and was a team leader; she chaired the Chinese Language\nDepartment for five years.  In that job she has a security clearance.  She became a U.S. citizen in\n1996. His stepfather is a U.S. citizen and a former U.S. Army officer. (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 25; 28-29;\n59-70) \nForeign Influence \nAfter he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant in summer 2001 returned to China to\nvisit his grandparents  with whom he was very close.  During his stay he met the woman who later\n3\nbecame his wife.  (Exhibit 1; TR 25-26)  Applicant explained his current contacts in China as\nfollows:\n9\nApplicant\u2019s father remains a citizen and a resident of  China as he returned there in 1993\nafter he was divorced from Applicant\u2019s mother. Applicant has contact with him by telephone\ntwice a year on holidays and his birthday.  He does not send money to his father. (Exhibit 1;\nTR 26; 32) His father taught at a university before he came to the U.S.  He retired when he\nreturned and invests in the stock market.  (TR 30)  While his mother has urged him to have\ncontact with his father, she testified that his contact is very limited. (TR 69-70) (SOR 1.a.)\n9\nApplicant\u2019s grandfather, now 93 years old, is a citizen and resident of China. Before he\nretired he was a university administrator.  Applicant  has contact with him by telephone twice\na year on holidays and his birthday.  Applicant stayed with him in 2001, 2002 and 2003 when\nhe visited China. He does not send gifts or money to his grandfather. (Exhibit 1; TR 26; 33-\n34; 42-43; 70) While Applicant has limited contact with his grandfather, is mother explained\nthat she has frequent contact with her father as he is 93 and is lonely.  He has a retirement\nstipend, so Applicant\u2019s mother does not send him any money.  (TR 65-70) (SOR 1.b., 1.e.)\n \n9\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of China, but a resident of the U. S. Whom he met when he\nvisited China in July 2001.  At the time he completed his SF 86 in 2004, he disclosed his\nrelationship with her as she was a citizen of China who was then studying for an MBA in\n\n4\nCanada and also visited him in the U.S.  He visited her in Canada as well as in China twice\nin 2002 and again in 2003. (Exhibit 1; TR 26)  She came to the U.S. in 2004 on a student\nvisa.  (TR 35)  He married her in September 2004.  (TR 18-19) She returned to China in\n2004 to visit her parents.  (TR 35) She got her Green Card in 2005 or 2006 based on her\nmarriage to a U.S. citizen.  She intends to become a U.S. citizen.  (TR 38-39; 58-59)  She\nworks as an auditor for an accounting firm.  (TR 40; 58) She clarified and confirmed\nApplicant\u2019s reports of his visits to China and Canada to visit her and his limited contacts\nwith his relatives in China.  She recalled that Applicant had sent a $1,000 gift to his father\nin 2004 or 2005 with the assistance of her father. (TR 45-58)  (SOR 1.c., 1.e.)\n9\nApplicant\u2019s wife has parents who live in and are citizens of China with whom she was\ncontact by telephone twice a week.  Applicant rarely has contact with them.  Her father is a\nlawyer and her mother works in the private sector as an office assistant.  (Answer; Exhibit\n2; TR 35) She calls her parents three times a week as she is an only child.  Her father who\nis 55 is a partner in a large law firm in China and her mother who is 51 works as an office\nassistant for a not-for-profit organization.  When she visited them in 2004 and 2005, her\nparents give her money -- $10,000 on each visit.  They gave her $6,000 in 2006.  Because\nApplicant and his wife plan to buy a home, her parents will provide additional money in\n2007: her parents will provide $50,000 for the down payment.  Her parents own their own\napartment in China and have other investments. They plan to visit her in the U.S. in 2007.\nHer parents have never been approached by anyone seeking information about her husband.\n(TR 45-58) (SOR 1.d.)\nIf any of Applicant\u2019s relatives in China were approached by someone seeking information\nabout Applicant, he would report any contact to the U.S. government agency.  He himself never\nreceived any requests or threats by a foreign national that should have been reported or might have\nbeen of security concern when he traveled in China.  (TR 38)  \nIs the foreign country known to target United States citizens \nto obtain protected information? \nThe Government provided for Administrative Notice several documents regarding China\nincluding a State Department Background Note on China, a country report on human rights practices\nfrom 2005, a Select Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives report, an annual report on\nforeign economic collection and industrial espionage, and an Intelligence Threat Handbook that\nincluded a section on China (\u201cThreat Handbook\u201d).  (AN I to V) The Threat Handbook observed,\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the PRC considers Chinese-Americans to be more vulnerable to approach\nthan any other group.\u201d The PRC uses \u201cwhatever feelings of obligation the targeted individual may\nhave toward China, family members in China, old friends in China, etc.\u201d  PRC\u2019s approach is \u201cnot\nto try to exploit a perceived vulnerability but to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help China out\nin some way.\u201d  (AN V at 21)  Department Counsel argued that security concerns exist because of\nChina\u2019s poor human rights records, its possession of strategic nuclear weapons and missiles, its\nbeing a rival of the U.S. since the Cold War, and its having actively targeted the U.S. with legal and\nillegal intelligence-gathering programs for economic intelligence.  (TR 73-74)\nFailure to Register for the Draft\n\n5\nWhen Applicant was 18, he did not know under U.S. law it was mandatory to register for the\ndraft.  He relied on his mother to explain such requirements to him; she testified credibly she did not\nunderstand what \u201cdraft\u201d meant.  At 26 after he got the SOR, he learned for the first time he should\nhave registered, but then when he attempted to register on line he learned he was too late as he had\npassed the upper age limit of 25.  (Exhibit 2; TR 26-27; 39-40; 41; 60-70) \nApplicant\u2019s mother explained she did not understand the requirement of her son to register\nfor the draft.   She did not understand what the word \u201cdraft\u201d meant at the time he applied to go to\ncollege in 1996.  She thought it meant he had to join the military and she did not feel he was mature\nenough to do so.  (TR 59-70) (SOR 2.a.)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or\nabsence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the\nevidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth\nbelow :\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n6. The concern:  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign\ninterest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of\nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding , but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \nGuideline E:  Personal Conduct\n15. The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and a candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process.  \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\n\n       7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  \n4\n(a.)  contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or a person  who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(e.)  A substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country. . . .which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\n       8.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n5\n(a.)  the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\n(c.) contact and correspondence with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood\nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\n(e.)  The individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of\ncontacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups or organizations from a foreign country;\n(f.)  the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are\nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the\nindividual.\n6\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence\nApplicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns over possible foreign influence\nraised by Applicant's close ties of affection to citizens of China, his father, his grandfather and his\nwife\u2019s parents.  The security concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, requires an assessment\nunder disqualifying condition (DC) 7.(a.) of the security risk  that may exist when an individual's\n4\nfamily member \u201cis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d   Applicant has visited\nhis relatives in China, but only on a limited and infrequent basis.  He reported these visits to his\ncompany, but he never experienced any pressure that raised a security concern.  Given the fact that\nboth his own relatives are retired and he has limited contact with him, they seem an unlikely target\nof the government of China.  Applicant has limited contact with his wife\u2019s parents.  While his wife\u2019s\nparents do work in China, she reported they have never been pressured for information about\nApplicant.  On the other hand, their generosity to the couple raises another concern: (7. e.)  A\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country. . . .which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  \nWhile I have considered these concerns, I conclude Applicant has presented evidence to meet\nthe burden of mitigating  those circumstances either under the mitigating conditions (MC) outlined\n5\nin the revised guidelines or by a whole person analysis.  Applicant's only family ties to China are his\n\n7\nfather and grandfather, both retired, with whom he has limited contact and only intermittent visits.\nOne notable element is assessing these security concerns is the fact that Applicant\u2019s mother has\nworked for the U.S. military for more than 15 years and has a security clearance.  While his wife has\ncontacts frequently with her parents, both report no evidence of any foreign duress or influence on\nApplicant and/or his immediate family in China.  On balance, both he and his wife have substantial\nprofessional incomes, they are not dependent and would not be influenced by the financial gifts of\nhis wife\u2019s parents.\nThus, despite the concerns over China economic espionage and human rights record, I\nconclude any risk would appear to be slight and clearly manageable under MC (a.).  Applicant is a\nU.S. citizen who was educated here and his mother has long had a security clearance.  Notably, the\nThreat Handbook indicates that PRC\u2019s approach is \u201cnot to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability\nbut to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help China out in some way.\u201d  (AN V at 21) Given\nApplicant\u2019s deep ties to the U.S., there is no evidence that he would have any motivation to \u201chelp\nChina out\u201d by his efforts.  While his wife remains a citizen of China, she is working for a U.S.\ncompany and has her green card and intends to become a U.S. citizen.  Moreover, Applicant made\nevident that at any hint of any coercion or pressure on herself or his family, he would immediate\nreport such coercion to a corporate security officer.  Thus, I find  there is no substantial likelihood\nthat he would be subject to duress merely because of these family ties.  While he traveled to China,\nthat travel alone does not raise a security concern.  His trips were with his U.S. passport which he\nfully disclosed to his employer and on his security form.\nWhile his wife\u2019s family have made substantial gifts to his father and to the couple, they have\nsubstantial resources and the couple themselves both work as professionals.  Consequently, in\ncomparing the value of the gifts to their other income, the fall within MC (f.) as  the value of the\nforeign financial interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the individual.\nAlso I have evaluated him under the whole person adjudicative process guidelines:  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (AG 2. Adjudication Process)\nLooking at all of these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has overcome  foreign influence\nsecurity concerns.  Given his strong and lengthy ties to the U.S. since he has lived in the U.S. since\n1988 and became a U.S. naturalized citizen in 2000, there is limited potential for coercion,\nexploitation or duress.  Since Applicant came to the U.S., he has seen no indicators that the\ngovernment of China has tried to exploit his relationship with his relatives in China.  If he did he\nwould report any attempts to U.S. officials.  While China does have a bad record on human rights\nand has a history of having targeted plans for economic intelligence, it is a country in transition from\na planned economy to a market economy began at the end of 1978.  After review all of the evidence\nI conclude,  there is little  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n\n      See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-\n6\n23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nSecurity clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's security eligibility\nin light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security\ndeterminations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Acts indicative of foreign influence warrant\ncareful scrutiny.  After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines,\nI conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue pressure on\nApplicant, so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1\nand subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.e. in Applicant's favor.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. In this case Applicant admits\nhe failed to register with the U.S. Selective Service when he was 18 as he did not know about this\nobligation, and his mother did not understand the process.  She testified credibly that she thought to\nregister was to enroll in the military.  He tried to take corrective action later, but was over 25, so\ncould not do so.  While none of the personal conduct guidelines really address this type of failure\nto comply with U.S. law, I found his and his mother\u2019s explanation credible that it was a failure to\nact, and not a deliberate disregard of U.S. legal requirements.  \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether\nthere is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time\nthe omission occurred.   Based on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and review of him as a whole\n6\nperson, I conclude that Guideline E  in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance to the Applicant.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Because he was incarcerated for more than one year, 10 U.S.C. 986 precludes him from\nreceiving a security clearance. Clearance is denied, but waiver recommended.\n\n See, Footnote 1 under Disqualifying Condition c of the Criminal Conduct guideline.\n1\n2\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 25, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 8, 2006, and elected to have his\ncase determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment's written case (FORM) on or about September 29, 2007. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 34 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn March 2000, applicant was involved in a traffic accident that resulted in a death. In 2001,\nhe pleaded guilty to the charge of Reckless Homicide, and was sentenced to ten years in prison, all\nbut three of which were suspended. He was incarcerated for 18 months. He was also placed on\nprobation for two years.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn March 2000, applicant was involved in a traffic accident that resulted in a death. In 2001,\nhe was convicted of Reckless Homicide and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He actually served\nabout 18 months in prison. Disqualifying Conditions b. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses), and c. (conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and\nsentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year) are applicable.\nAlthough applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was clearly serious, this isolated incident occurred\nover six years ago. In addition, this criminal conduct is of the type that is unlikely to recur. Based\non these facts, applicant qualifies for Mitigating Conditions a. (the criminal behavior was not\nrecent), b. (the crime was an isolated incident) and d. (the person did not voluntarily commit the act\nand/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur).\nGiven the passage of time since applicant engaged in this isolated act of criminal conduct,\nthe unintentional nature of the crime, and the absence of any evidence of subsequent misconduct or\ncriminal conduct on the part of applicant, I conclude that he is unlikely to engage in criminal conduct\nin the future. If it were not for 10 U.S.C. 986, I would conclude that it is now clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant him access to classified information. In light of this statute, however,\nI must conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant applicant a security\nclearance.  I recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.\n1\n\n3\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He admitted that he used marijuana about five times from November 2003 to\nDecember 2003. He successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program and does not intend to use\nit in the future. He mitigated the security concerns raised by a history of drug involvement. Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 31, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86). The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2. (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 16, 2006, detailing the basis\nfor its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense\neffective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was\nissued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 7, 2006, and requested a hearing before\nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice\nof Hearing on February 16, 2007, setting the case for March 1, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1and 2 into\nevidence without objections. Applicant testified in his case and called two other witnesses. He\nintroduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through D into evidence without objections. DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 12, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 49-year-old certified marine chemist who has worked for a federal contractor\nsince December 1985 (GX 1 at 2). He has held a confidential security clearance since 1992 (Id. at 7).\nHe is married and has two children, ages 24 and 17. \nApplicant was an avid fisherman until he lost his fishing boat in 2001 (Tr.53). Sometime in the\nsummer or fall of 2003, he met an individual at a cookout who also enjoyed fishing (Tr. 55). Several\nweeks after meeting, the individual invited Applicant to go on a fishing trip in November.  Applicant\nconsented. He subsequently went fishing with the individual and the individual\u2019s friends about 10-12\ntimes (Tr. 55). On about five of those fishing trips, Applicant smoked marijuana with some of the men\non the boat. About a week after smoking marijuana in the middle of December 2003, Applicant was\ncalled for a random drug test in accordance with his company\u2019s policy. The test was positive and the\ncompany reported the incident to the Defense Security Service (GX 2). He no longer associates with\nthose friends (Tr. 70).\n\n3\nOn December 29, 2003, Applicant entered an outpatient substance abuse treatment program\n(AX A-1). After finishing the outpatient portion of the program, he was discharged on February 19,\n2004, with a diagnosis of cannabis dependence. In a February 23, 2004, assessment sheet, the licensed\nprofessional counselor noted that he successfully completed the program. He was \u201cafforded the\nopportunity to attend Aftercare one time per week\u201d with a certified substance abuse counselor (AX 3).\nThe sheet noted, \u201cThis opportunity is only afforded to the patients who are motivated to make positive\nchanges in their lives.\u201d (Id.) In the Aftercare Discharge summary of April 22, 2004, the staff noted that\nhe had completed aftercare treatment with a good prognosis and that his condition had improved (Id.).\nOn February 27, 2007, he met with his previous counselor who noted those urine drug screens on\n\u201c9/16/05, 1/8/07, 2/5/07 and 2/13/07 were negative.\u201d (AX 5) She stated, \u201cHis prognosis is good should\nhe continue to follow this recovery maintenance plan.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant has not smoked marijuana since December 2003, more than three years ago, and\ndoes not intend to use it in the future (Tr. 62; 69). He knows he used poor judgment when he decided\nto smoke it on those fishing trips (Tr. 75). He believes he has learned from his mistakes. He needs to\nbe more prudent in choosing friends and should evaluate his priorities carefully (Tr. 74-76). He is\nremorseful and realizes the seriousness of this situation, having had \u201cthree years to think about it.\u201d (Tr.\n69).\nApplicant periodically attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings and discusses his issues with\nsome of the people who attend the meetings (Tr. 66; 80). He also attends church regularly and sings\nin the choir. \nThe vice-president of Applicant\u2019s employer testified. He is responsible for some of the\ncompany\u2019s accounting matters and administers the random drug testing program. He holds a\nconfidential security clearance. He has known Applicant for 22 years and observed him a couple\ntimes a week over the course of those years (Tr. 29-31). He was surprised by Applicant\u2019s positive\ndrug screen (Tr. 36). He believes Applicant is embarrassed by the situation, and thinks it was mistake\nthat will not happen again (Tr. 33). He supports Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance (Tr. 33).\nThe president of the company, who has known Applicant for 28 years, also submitted a letter\non behalf of Applicant. He is positive in his characterizations of Applicant and notes that Applicant\nhas been in several positions of authority over the years(AX D-2).\nApplicant\u2019s wife learned of her husband\u2019s marijuana use after he was notified of the positive\ndrug screen (Tr. 48). She feels he is a very good father and husband (Tr. 42-43). She does not believe\nhe will smoke marijuana again (Tr. 46).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position. . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\n\nAG 24(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) Drugs, materials,\n1\nand other chemical compounds . . . (marijuana or canabis).\n4\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR:\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\nThe security concern under Guideline H is that the use of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and  trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admission that he has used marijuana five times from November 2003\nto December 2003, while holding a security clearance,  the Government established a disqualification\nunder Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) 25(a) any drug abuse,  and 25(g) any\n1\nillegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. Four conditions can mitigate security concerns arising from drug\ninvolvement. After reviewing all of them, I conclude as follows. \n(1) Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) 26(a) the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment is\napplicable. Applicant has not smoked marijuana for more than three years. At the time he smoked\nit, he was fishing with individuals with whom he no longer associates. Since that time he has learned\nfrom his mistakes and strongly expressed his remorse over the incident, such that it is unlikely that\nhe will repeat the misconduct. Given the change in his attitude, I do not believe his past conduct,\n\n5\nwhich occurred about five times over two months, casts doubt on his current reliability or\ntrustworthiness. In fact, I suspect he is more circumspect about making decisions and exercising his\njudgement.\n(2) Applicant provided mitigation under DI MC 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any\ndrugs in the future. He no longer associates with the people with whom he smoked marijuana, which\nis the evidence necessary to establish 26(b)(1) disassociation from drug-using associated and\ncontacts. He has not used marijuana for three years, which is sufficient to trigger the application of\n26(b)(3) an appropriate period of abstinence.\n(3) DI MC 26(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during\nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended is not applicable to the situation.\n(4) DI MC 26(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including\nbut not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional is applicable. Applicant successfully\ncompleted an outpatient and aftercare treatment program, received a favorable prognosis from a\nqualified medical professional, and has not used marijuana since participating in the program.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is known as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis. Directive \u00b6 E2.2. In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative judge\nshould consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s middle age, his demeanor while testifying, his embarrassment about using marijuana,\nas well as the personal insights he gained about his behavior since the incident in 2003. I took into\naccount the support of his employer and an otherwise good performance record over the last 20\nyears, which includes holding a security clearance. I carefully weighed the fact that he did not report\nhis misconduct at the time, against his rehabilitative efforts and abstinence for the last three years.\nGiven his present concern for his career and family, I believe he will continue to take the necessary\nsteps to maintain abstinence and prevent a recurrence. Hence, he mitigated the allegations raised in\nthe SOR. Accordingly, Guideline H is found in his favor.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n6\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

She failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial\nconsiderations since she provided no plan as to how she was going to resolve her delinquent debts.\nApplicant's eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \"Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\" dated November 19, 2004.\n Item 4.\n2\n3\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 26, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\").  On September 22, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F,\nFinancial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement dated November 13, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on December 14, 2006. The FORM\nwas mailed to Applicant on December 18, 2006, and received on December 28, 2006. Applicant was\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation. Applicant responded on January 16, 2007.

On March 7, 2007, I issued an order sending Applicant a copy of the\nrevised AG, effective September 1, 2006 and gave her the opportunity to submit additional\ndocuments and/or comments within 30 days upon receipt of the revised AG. She received a copy of\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines on March 16, 2007.

In May 2004, the Chapter 13 was\ndismissed due to her failure to make payments on the plan.4\nIn response to question \"22b. Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial\nobligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government,\"\nApplicant answered, \"Yes\" and listed two hospital bills. Her background investigation revealed 34\ndelinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of $33,433.  Out of these accounts, 26 accounts\n5\nwere over 180 days delinquent.6\nThe delinquent accounts included a $2,917 account delinquent since February 2000 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.b); a $396 account placed for collection in May 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $608 judgment entered in\nAugust 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $5,099 account charged off in September 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $10,252\ndelinquent account related to a vehicle repossession in November 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a $5,099\naccount charged off in February 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a $1,083 account placed for collection in\nFebruary 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); a $74 account placed for collection in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); a $45\naccount placed for collection in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); a $64 account placed for collection in August\n2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a $195 account placed for collection in September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); a $144\nsatellite television account placed for collection in October 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.m); a $925 account\nplaced for collection in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.n); a $164 account placed for collection in November\n2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.o); a $1,850 home gift account placed for collection in January 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.p);\na $395 account placed for collection in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.q); a $71 account placed for\ncollection in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.r); a $71 account placed for collection in February 2004 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.s); a $126 furniture store account delinquent since May 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.t); a $180 account placed\nfor collection in May 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.u); a $60 account placed for collection in May 2004 (SOR \u00b6\n1.v); a $299 account placed for collection in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.w); a $1,225 credit card account\ncharged off in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.x); a $14,046 account placed for collection in September 2004\n(SOR \u00b6 1.y); a $48 account placed for collection in September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.z); a $58 account\nplaced for collection in January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.aa); a $397 account placed for collection in February\n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.bb); a $300 account, placed for collection in February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.cc); a $722\naccount placed for collection in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.dd); a $247 account placed for collection in\nApril 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.ee); a $108 account placed for collection in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.ff); a\n$344 utility account placed for collection in December 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.gg); a $999 credit card\n\n Id. \n7\n Additional Comments received on April 20, 2007, March 25, 2007, phone bill.\n8\n Item 3.\n9\n Items 4 and 5.\n10\n Response to FORM, dated January 16, 2007.\n11\n Id.\n12\n5\naccount closed in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.hh); and a $173 telephone account placed for collection\nin February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.ii).7\nApplicant denies the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. She is not familiar with the debt.  She claims\nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ff has been paid in full but provided no proof verifying that it was paid.\nShe denies the telephone company debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ii. She still has an account with the\ntelephone company and believes her phone would have been disconnected if the debt was valid. She\nprovided a copy of her most recent phone bill indicating she is current on her account.  She indicates\n8\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.y are the same debt. She also indicates the debts alleged in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g are the same debt.  The credit reports reveal the same account numbers for these\n9\naccounts.  The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.y and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g appear to be duplicates of each\n10\nother.  As such, I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g.\nMany of the debts were included in Applicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy was\ndismissed since Applicant stopped making payments on the plan. She claims they could no longer\nafford the payments.  There is no evidence that she made any payments towards these accounts once\nthe bankruptcy was dismissed due to lack of payments. 11\nIn her response to the File of Relevant Material, Applicant indicates that she married her\nhusband in 1995 at the age of 15.  He was 18. They had their son that same year.  In 1997, they\npurchased two cars in Applicant's name. They had good jobs at the time. In 1999, Applicant lost her\naccounting job.  Her company was purchased by another company in another city.  Her accounting\nposition was deleted. Her husband lost his job a few months later. They returned their cars to the\ndealership because they could not afford the payments.  She found a lesser paying job but they could\nnot afford health insurance. As a result, they incurred a lot of hospital bills. 12\nApplicant's husband suffers from back problems and has been unable to work a steady job\nas a result. In February 2004, they both found jobs that paid well but still did not have health\ninsurance. Applicant's company had health insurance but she declined health insurance because she\nthought it was too expensive. Her husband was not eligible for health insurance with his company\nuntil September 2004.  In July 2004, her husband was severely injured in a car accident. They\nincurred a lot of medical expenses because they had no health insurance. Her husband has been\n\n Id.\n13\n Id. \n14\n Additional Response received on April 20, 2007.\n15\n Item 3.\n16\n Department of the Navy v.

He filed for disability in 2006 but the claim was denied.\nHe is appealing.  \n13\nApplicant has no money left over to make payments towards her delinquent debts. She is the\nsole supporter of her family.  She believes that she has demonstrated that she is trustworthy during\nher one year and five months of employment with her company.  She indicates taking her job away\nwill not help her situation.  It will only make things worse.   In her April 20, 2007, submission\n14\nAppellant indicated she talked with a couple attorneys regarding her debts. She was advised to file\nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy because she owes more than her yearly income. She intends to go through\ncredit counseling in the future.  \n15\nApplicant did not try to hide her financial situation when filling out her trustworthiness\napplication.  Question 22b provided only two lines to list delinquent debts so she listed her two most\nrecent debts. Later, when she was interviewed in conjunction with her background investigation, she\nfully disclosed the extent of debts and how she encountered financial problems.16\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n17\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nset forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each\nguideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n18\n Id.\n19\n Id.\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n21\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n23\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n24\n7\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate\nwith the security clearance process. \nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n18\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n19\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n20\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based\non the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the\nadjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).  \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n21\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n22\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n23\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n24\nfor access to sensitive positions.\n\n8\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts with a total\napproximate balance of $33,433. Many of these debts have been delinquent for several years. Based\non her income and her husband's inability to work, she is unable to pay the debt.\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Applicant has a\nsignificant amount of delinquent debt that remains unresolved. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC\n\u00b620(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment). \nThere is evidence to support the application of FC MC \u00b620(b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant's financial problems began when\nshe lost a well paying job in 1999.  I also considered that her husband's health issues and his car\naccident in July 2004, prevented him from working on a steady basis. I considered the fact that\nApplicant incurred a lot of medical expenses since they had no health insurance. However, I also\nconsidered that Applicant opted not to enroll in her employer's health insurance program claiming it\nwas too expensive.  Her choice not to enroll in health insurance contributed to the added expenses\nincurred  at the time of her husband's car accident. MC 3 applies, in part, but I give it less weight since\none must consider whether the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. There are\nexplanations for Applicant's financial issues, but she has no current plan to resolve her financial\nsituation.  \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply.  There is\nno evidence in the record indicating Applicant attended financial counseling.  Although she attempted\nto resolve her financial situation by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in January 2001, she failed to\nkeep up with the payments on her Chapter 13 plan and her bankruptcy was dismissed in 2004.  In her\nadditional response received on April 20, 2007, she indicated that she plans to attend financial\ncounseling in the future.  Currently, all of the debt remains delinquent. Applicant's financial situation\nremains the same and is unlikely to be resolved in the future.\nFC MC \u00b620(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Although she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, she did not\nfollow through with the payment plan. Applicant provided no evidence that she has taken steps to\nrepay her delinquent creditors or resolve her accounts since her Chapter 13 was dismissed in May\n2004. Since she failed to comply with the terms of her Chapter 13 repayment plan and has no plan\nfor resolving her outstanding debts, I cannot conclude that she made a good-faith effort to resolve her\ndebts.\n\n9\nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. Guideline\nF is decided against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.  \nIn this case, Applicant denies that she intentionally falsified material facts on a public trust\napplication, dated August 26, 2005, in response to question 22b regarding whether she had delinquent\ndebts that were over 180 days old.  She answered, \"yes\" and listed two medical accounts but not did\nlist her other delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.cc).  She explained that she did not list all of\nthe debts because there were only two lines on the trustworthiness application to list debts so she\nlisted her two most recent debts.  She fully discussed all of her debts when she was interviewed by\nthe OPM investigator conducting her background investigation.  I find she did not intend to hide her\nfinancial situation from the government. In response to question 22a on the same public trust\napplication, she listed the fact that she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in January 2001.  Although\nshe was not thorough when listing her specific delinquent debts, she gave the federal government\nnotice that she had financial problems when she indicated that she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nI find Applicant had no intent to deliberately falsify her trustworthiness application by withholding\nthe extent of her delinquent debt.  Guideline E is decided for Applicant.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concern raised by her extensive\ndelinquent debt. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

She then ignored payment of her bills. She has matured since\nher college graduation six years ago. In the last year, she assumed responsibility for payment of her\ndelinquent debt. She has systematically paid her debts, one or two at a time. She did not intentionally\nfalsify her answers on her SF-85P. She has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns regarding her\nfinances. The government did not establish its case under Guidelines E and J. Eligibility is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 7, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On November 29, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).\nIn a sworn statement dated December 28, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. DOHA assigned this case to me on February 8, 2007, and issued a notice of\nhearing on March 2, 2007. At the hearing on March 21, 2007, Applicant indicated that she received\nthe notice of the hearing 15 days prior to the hearing. I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  The\n2\ngovernment submitted seven exhibits (GE) which were marked and admitted into the record as GE\n1-7, without objection. Applicant submitted 16 exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted\nas App Ex A-P, without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on April 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations under Guideline F, except\nsubparagraphs 1.p and 1.q. She denies all of the allegations under Guidelines E and J. Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application) at 1; Tr. at 36, 48-49.\n3\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 2; Tr. at 37-38.\n4\nApp Ex A (January 2007 performance evaluation) at 4; App Ex B (Letter, dated March 13, 2007); App Ex C\n5\n(Letter, dated March 18, 2007).\nGE 5 (Credit report, dated July 10, 2003); GE 6 (Credit report, dated December 10, 2004); and GE 7 (Credit\n6\nreport, dated August 24, 2006).\nApp Ex P (Payment receipt from creditor, dated January 24, 2007).\n7\nApp Ex E (Letter dated February 7, 2007, February 28, 2007, copy of payment check).\n8\nApp Ex M (Copy of account statement from creditor, dated January 24, 2007 and copy of bank statement\n9\nshowing payment).\n3\nApplicant, a 29-year-old woman employed as a claims processor and project leader for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor, seeks a position of public trust. She has worked for her employer\nfor more than four years. She has a two-year-old daughter, for whom she provides support.3\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1996. She attended college from 1996 through 2001,\ngraduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2001. As a college student, she obtained credit cards,\nwhich she used to purchase various items. She ignored paying the credit card bills, which are now\nmore than seven years old. She also experienced some medical problems while in school and incurred\nbills, which she ignored and are many years delinquent. She based her attitude towards her paying her\nbills at this time on immaturity.4\nAfter college graduation, she worked one year as a resident counselor for a child and family\nservices organization. She left that position for her current job. Her co-workers describe her as\nprofessional, courteous, trustworthy, and a person of integrity and commitment. In her most recent\nevaluation, her employer rated her overall at meets expectations.5\nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated July 10, 2003, December 10, 2004, August 24,\n2006, and the SOR shows 19 unpaid debts totaling $8,635.

She pays her mother $230 a month in rent\nand pays all the necessary living expenses for them. In addition to her usual living expense, about a\nyear ago, she started repaying her delinquent debts, one or two at a time. She receives no child support\nfrom her daughter\u2019s father. During the course of her relationship with her daughter\u2019s father, Applicant\nand he shared a cell phone service. The unpaid phone bill in allegation 1.q is that account. He refuses\nto pay the debt or any part of it. Applicant is trying to negotiate some payment from him. She realizes\nthe importance of good credit and paying bills on time. She expressed a desire to be a good example\nfor her daughter on this issue.23\nOn December 12, 2002, Applicant completed her first questionnaire for a position of public\ntrust (SF-85P). She answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 22b and listed one credit card debt. Subsequent to\ncompleting her application, she met with an investigator, who discussed her delinquent debts with\nher. She signed a sworn statement on November 5, 2003. She acknowledged all but three of the debts\ndiscussed and listed in her July 2003 credit report. She lacked financial resources at this time to repay\nthese debts, most of which she incurred as an irresponsible college student.24\nApplicant completed a second SF-85P on November 8, 2004. She answered \u201cno\u201d to question\n22b, which asked if she \u201cwas now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?\u201d She\ndid not list any debts discussed with the investigator in 2003, although she acknowledged talking with\nthe investigator about her debts at the hearing. When answering this question, she did not think about\npast debts or retrieve a copy of her credit report and review it for old, unpaid debts. She considered\nonly her current bills, which were timely.25\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n26\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b62(a)(1)-(9).\n27\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n28\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., December 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n29\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n30\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd., August 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n31\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Decision and Reversal Order, January 27, 1995); Directive,\n32\nEnclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n33\n6\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each\ntrustworthiness decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.27\nThe sole purpose of a trustworthiness determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust.  The\n28\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than\n29\na preponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n30\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n31\ndecision.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national\n32\nsecurity will be resolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness\n33\ndeterminations for access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\n\n7\nIt did not establish a prima facie case under Guideline E - Personal Conduct and Guideline J - Criminal\nConduct. \nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect several old,\nunpaid debts, most of which applicant acknowledged. She incurred the majority of these debts when\nshe was a college student. Because of the age of these debts, their delinquent status, and her past\nattitude towards debt payment, Applicant showed an inability or unwillingness to pay her debts. Based\non the evidence of record, the government established the applicability of DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant\u2019s debt developed as a result of irresponsible financial behavior while a college\nstudent. She has not presented any evidence which indicates that her delinquent debts were the result\nof conditions beyond her control. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant never met with a financial counselor, she contacted most of the creditors\nto whom she owed money and made arrangements to pay her debts. She has paid many of her smaller\ndebts in full. As her finances permit each month, she pays one or more of her remaining delinquent\ndebts. She made arrangements to pay two of her debts on a monthly basis with one being currently\npaid, and the second debt repayment to begin in July 2007. She has acted in good faith to resolve her\nunpaid debts. She otherwise lives within her financial means. MC \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control and MC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts apply. She is not required to be debt free; rather she must\nmanage her income and expenditures in a reasonable and prudent manner, which she is doing. She\nprovided sufficient evidence to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns regarding her finances. Guideline\nF is found in favor of Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) Under DC \u00b6 16 (a), the government established that\nApplicant omitted a material fact from her SF-85P when she answered \u201cno\u201d to question 22b. She\ndenies, however, that she deliberately falsified her answer to this question. When a falsification\nallegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing\nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n34\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\nomission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\n34\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . to apply, the government must establish\nthat Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her answer was deliberate.\nApplicant credibly testified that she did not think about her old debts when completing the\n2004 SF-85P application. Two years earlier, she admitted overdue debt when completing her SF-85P,\nand reviewed all her past due debts with the investigator. She did not attempt to hide this information\nat the time. In light of her admissions in 2002 and 2003, and the government\u2019s knowledge of these\nadmitted debts, she had no realistic reason to conceal these debts when completing her more recent\nSF-85P. I find that she did not intentionally falsify her answer to question 22b. Guideline E is found\nin favor of Applicant.\nCriminal Conduct\nIn light of my findings under Guideline E, the government cannot establish a violation of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 based on allegation 2.a. I find in favor of Applicant under Guideline J.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nAs a college student, Applicant obtained credit cards to purchase items she wanted, then\nignored paying the bills. She did the same with medical bills she incurred. She acted irresponsibly\nabout her debts. Since graduating from college six years ago, she has matured. She has worked for the\nsame company for over four years and is the sole provider for her young daughter. In the last year, she\nstarted repaying her very old delinquent debt. Because she cannot repay all her debt in one lump sum,\nshe has chosen to repay one or two bills at a time. By this decision, she has systematically paid many\nof her bills. She negotiated two payment plans for larger debts, one which she is paying and one to\nbegin payment shortly. She has assumed responsibility for her old debts, while remaining timely on\nher current bills.\nThe creditors for the unpaid bills in allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.j of the SOR are barred from\ncollecting these debts under the State in which she resides 3-year statute of limitations. See State Code.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n35\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n9\nAnn. \u00a7 15-3-530.  Thus, she receives partial credit for resolution of her debt. The State Court of\n35\nAppeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nElimination of these delinquent debts through the statute of limitations has ended her potential\nvulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer \u201cfinancially overextended\u201d,\nbut it does not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding debts. To her credit, she has acted\nresponsibly by paying many old bills barred from collection under the statue of limitations. She has\nalso developed a payment plan for one very old bill. By so doing, she has demonstrated her ability to\nact responsibly for her old debts. In recent years, she has not incurred excessive unpaid debt and has\ncurtailed her spending habits. \nApplicant performs her duties well and is respected by her co-workers for her work ethic and\nintegrity. I have weighed the mitigating factors, her change in attitude towards her finances, her\nassumption of responsibility for her old debt and her failure to list her debts in her most recent\ntrustworthiness application. I find that the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that she is\na person of integrity, who is trustworthy. She would not act in a manner which would harm her\nemployer or the government. There is little likelihood she would violate these privacy rights because\nof her existing debt problems. I conclude she has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to\nfinancial considerations. The personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns are not substantiated.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-s:\n     For Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\n     For Applicant\n\n10\nSOR \u00b6 3-Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\n     For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Applicant is current on all of her recent debts, and she has\ndemonstrated a stable and mature outlook about her finances.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December  26, 2006 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nIn a signed and notarized statement, dated January 31, 2007, Applicant responded in writing\nto the SOR allegations (RSOR), and she requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.\nThe case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge on February 27, 2007, but\nit was reassigned to this Administrative Judge on March 20, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued\nto the parties on March 19, 2007, and the hearing was held on April 12, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-6) and no\nwitnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, offered nine documentary exhibits\n(Exhibits A through I) and offered her own testimony. The record was held open until April 19,\n2007,  for Applicant, and Applicant 26, 2007,  for Department Counsel to offer post hearing exhibits.\nApplicant offered a cover letter, outlines of DOHA decisions, and other  documents regarding Statute\nof Limitations, which have been identified as Exhibit J. Department Counsel submitted copies of\nthree DOHA Appeal Board decisions, and the laws from several states regarding Statute of\nLimitations, which are marked as Exhibit 7. All documentary evidence was entered into evidence\nwithout objection. The transcript (Tr) was received on April 23, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contained five allegations, 1.a.\nthrough 1.e., under Guideline F. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the live testimony and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is 37 years old. She is not married and has no children. Applicant is employed by\n\n3\na defense contractor, and she seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with her\nemployment in the defense sector. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists five overdue debts of Applicant, 1.a. through 1.e., under Adjudicative\nGuideline F.  They will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR: \n1.a. This debt is  listed in the SOR to Creditor 1 in the amount of $10,267.79. At the hearing,\nApplicant testified that she had initially intended to pay of this debt, which is still due in the amount\nstated above.  However, she was informed that it was no longer enforceable since it was now barred\nby the statute of limitations, and therefore she did not plan to pay off this debt. In her post hearing\nletter, Applicant indicated that she has now changed her mind and plans to pay off the debts that she\nbelieves are barred by the statute of limitations (Exhibit J). She stated,  \nI have since made the very personal decision to continue debt repayment for my two\nremaining debts despite the fact that the Statute of Limitations has expired. I realize\nthat regardless of how much time has past, I knowingly and willfully incurred those\ndebts and it is my responsibility still to them (morally if not legally). I have made an\nappointment to discuss my repayment options with a Credit Counseling organization.\n. . . Given my disposable income currently, I do not foresee a problem with a clearing\nup the old debt in a relatively short time.\n1.b.  This debt is listed in the SOR to Creditor 2 in the amount of $6,805. This is the second\ndebt referred to in Applicant\u2019s letter, which she now plans to pay despite her belief that it is not\nlegally collectible. \n1.c.  This debt is listed in the SOR to Creditor 3 in the amount of $1,313. Applicant testified\nthat she had resolved this debt in full with a payment of $640 on March 5, 2007. Exhibit D\nestablishes that this debt has been settled. \n \n1.d.  This debt is listed in the SOR to Creditor 4 in the amount of $807. Applicant testified\nthat she had resolved this debt in full with a payment of $685.67 on April 10, 2007. Exhibit E\nestablishes that this debt has been settled.  \n1.e.  This debt is listed in the SOR to Creditor 5 in the amount of $3,938.08. Applicant\ntestified that she had resolved this debt in full with a payment of $2,200 on April 11, 2007. Exhibit\nF establishes that this debt has been settled. \n \nThe issue of unenforceable collection of debts barred because of the Statute of Limitations,\nwas raised at the hearing, and the record was held open to allow both Applicant and Department\nCounsel an opportunity to submit evidence regarding this issue. However, since Applicant now\nindicates that she intends to resolve these two debts, I find that issue now moot in this case. \nIn her RSOR and at the PA, Applicant indicated that she had near perfect credit history until\n2000. At that time her job location was reassigned without her request, and she was forced to move\nto a locality  with a higher price of living. She was then relocated a second time to an even more\nexpensive place to work and live. Her financial situation became more tenuous, and she consulted a\n\n4\ncredit counseling service, but they were unable to help her resolve her financial problems. She did\ncontact all of her creditors in 2002 to attempt to resolve her debts, but she could not reach a\nmanageable arrangement with the creditors.  \nShe conceded that she was so overwhelmed by her financial difficulties and at a loss for a\nsolution, that she simply did nothing. Applicant also lost her job through downsizing, and was\nunemployed from June through August 2005, when she began her current employment. \nCurrently, Applicant does not have any other overdue accounts beside those already discussed\nabove. She conceded that credit card debt was part of what led to her fiscal problems, and she does\nnot have any credit cards now, nor does she plan to apply for any in the future. \nApplicant submitted into evidence a Personal Financial Statement (Exhibit C) that was\nprepared on January 17, 2006, which shows a monthly net reminder of $1,946. Applicant  will be able\nto use this to resolve her last two overdue debts. \nFinally, Applicant introduced three letters of recommendation from individuals who know\nApplicant in her professional setting. They strongly recommended her for a position of trust and\ndescribed her in extremely positive terms (Exhibit I). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). \n\n5\nBURDEN OF PROOF\n              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish\nhis security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\ndemonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness\nfor access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such\nfactors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and\nevidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has\na heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted\nby the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988),\n\"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors,\nI conclude the following with respect to Guideline F: \nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties and\noverdue debts. However, Applicant had the difficult problems of having to relocate two times and\neach time to more expensive areas, combined with a period of unemployment that contributed to her\nfinancial difficulties. The evidence shows that Applicant has resolved three of her debts, and she now\navers that she intends to resolve the other two overdue debts. Finally, all of Applicant\u2019s other bills\nare current and she now exhibits responsible financial behavior. \nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both DC (a)., and\nDC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting financial obligations and her previous\ninability to satisfy her debts. However, I find that Mitigating Condition (MC) (a)  applies because the\nbehavior that resulted in Applicant\u2019s overdue debts occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability trustworthiness or good\njudgement. MC (b) also applies because Applicant went through problems, including loss of\nemployment and being required to relocate to more expensive places to live on two occasions, both\nof which were beyond her control. MC (c) is applicable because Applicant has received counseling\nto better manage her finances. Finally, MC (d) applies because Applicant has initiated a good-faith\neffort to resolve her overdue debts.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F for Applicant.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the  Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations,  Guideline F: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJ. Theodore Hammer, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has only recently started to repay. He\nwas not candid about his financial delinquencies on his October 2004 security clearance application.\n\nThere is no explanation why the government gave Applicant only 20 days from receipt to respond to the motion\n1\nwhen he was given 30 days from receipt to respond to the FORM which is required under the Directive.\n2\nApplicant has not yet proven that he can handle his finances responsibly or that his representations\ncan be relied on. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 15, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2007, and elected to have a\ndetermination on the written record without a hearing. The government submitted a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on March 19, 2007, consisting of 11 exhibits (Items 1-11). The government also\nmoved at that time to amend the SOR by deleting specific page references in SOR \u00b6 2.a, modifying\nthe language in SOR \u00b6 2.b to correct the date and nature of the charges and punishment in a July 2,\n1996 proceeding under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and to delete SOR \u00b6 2.d.\nOn March 21, 2007, DOHA forwarded a copy of the motion and FORM to Applicant and instructed\nhim to respond to the motion within 20 days of receipt and to the FORM within 30 days of receipt.1\nApplicant filed a timely rebuttal on April 9, 2007,  to which the government did not object. The case\nwas assigned to me on April 17, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn the issuance of the FORM, the government moved to amend the SOR under Guideline\nJ, to delete \u00b6 2.d and omit from \u00b6 2.a the references to specific page numbers, and to modify \u00b6 2.c\nto read as follows:\n2.c. You received Non-Judicial Punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code\nof Military Justice on or about July 2, 1996 for the offenses (1) Assault, (2) Sodomy\nand (3) Adultery. Your punishment was a reduction in grade, forfeiture of $250 pay,\nextra duty for 14 days, and restriction for 14 days.\nAuthority to consider the motion is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and evidence and\nshall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner). The government is not\n\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel indicated he elected to not return the SOR to Applicant to answer the\n2\nallegations, as it would have unnecessarily delayed a determination of the case.\n3\nprecluded from raising issues of potential security concern, even at the hearing level, provided the\nproposed allegations have a reasonable basis, are not confusing, and are relevant to a determination\nof Applicant\u2019s suitability (see \u00b6 E3.1.17 The SOR may be amended at the hearing to render it in\nconformity with the evidence admitted or for other good cause). Absent a valid, compelling basis\nto deny the motion, the amendment will be granted.\nDue process requires that Applicant be given adequate notice and opportunity to respond.\nApplicant had timely notice of the proposed allegations and in his rebuttal to the FORM did not\nrespond directly to the motion to amend. Accordingly, the SOR is amended as requested by the\ngovernment in its motion of March 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged in the SOR under Guideline F that Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling\n$17,227 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j) that had not been paid by September 25, 2006 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j) and/or\nNovember 28, 2006 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i). Under Guideline J, as amended, Applicant was\nalleged to have been charged in December 1997 with felony sexual assault (dismissed) (\u00b6 2.a), to\nhave been charged with domestic violence/disorderly conduct in May 1997 (\u00b6 2.b), to have received\nnon-judicial punishment in July 2006 for assault, sodomy, and adultery (\u00b6 2.c), and to have\ncommitted a felony violation of 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1001 by deliberately falsifying his October 2004 security\nclearance application (SF 86) (\u00b6 2.e). Guideline E concerns were also raised concerning his alleged\ndeliberate failure to disclose his December 1997 arrest and his delinquent debts on his SF 86 (\u00b6\u00b6 3.a,\n3.b, and 3.c).\nIn his Answer, Applicant indicated the debts had been paid in full or settled for less than the\nfull balance. He admitted he had responded \u201cNo\u201d to the inquiries on his October 2004 SF 86\nconcerning any felony offenses, any financial delinquencies over 180 days in the past seven years,\nand any debts currently over 90 days delinquent, but he denied knowing and willful falsification. He\ndid not respond directly to the criminal conduct allegations other than to indicate that he had been\nfound innocent of the charge alleged in \u00b6 2.a.  After a thorough consideration of the documentation\n2\npresented for review, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 32-year-old electronics technician who has worked for his current employer,\na defense contractor, since September 2004. He seeks a security clearance for his duties on a U.S.\nmilitary base.\nApplicant and his spouse married on July 1, 1993. That same day, he entered on active duty\nin the U.S. Army. While he was in the military, he held a Secret-level security clearance, which was\ngranted to him in early September 1993.  On May 31, 1996, his spouse filed a complaint with the\nmilitary police that Applicant had assaulted her (pushed her and struck her) during a domestic\naltercation. On July 2, 1996, Applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the\nUniform Code of Military Justice for the assault of his spouse on May 31, 1996, and for sodomy and\nhaving sexual intercourse (adultery) with a female private not his spouse between January 13, 1996\n\n4\nand April 27, 1996. Applicant was reduced in grade to private first class, given 14 days extra duty,\nplaced on 14 days restriction, and ordered to forfeit $250 pay. All punishments but the extra duty\nwere suspended, to be automatically remitted if not vacated before January 1, 1997.\nWhile he was still in the service, Applicant was arrested by civilian authorities on or about\nMay 31, 1997, and charged with domestic violence/disorderly conduct. No disposition is reflected\nin the record.\nAfter his four years of active duty ended in early July 1997, Applicant returned to his\nhometown with his spouse where he was unemployed until April 1998. On December 6, 1997,\nApplicant was arrested on a capias and charged with sexual assault/battery on physically helpless,\na felony offense. The charge was nolle prossed on April 23, 1998.\nFrom April 1998 to late May 2003, Applicant worked as a facility technician for the\ntelephone company until he was laid off. He was unemployed until mid-September 2004, when he\nstarted with his current employer. Needing a clearance for his duties, Applicant executed a security\nclearance application (SF 86) on October 12, 2004. He responded negatively to police record\ninquiries, including question 21 [\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.) For this item, report\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken\nfrom the record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal\nControlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of\n21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d]. He also answered \u201cNO\u201d to inquiries into his financial record,\nincluding question 38 [\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u2019]\nand question 39 [\u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d].\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 16, 2004, revealed several accounts had been\ncharged off and/or placed for collection:\n\u2022\nA $2,233 past due balance was owed on a computer debt that had been placed\nfor collection in about March 2003 (\u00b6 1.d).\n\u2022\nA $50 past due balance was owed to the assignee of a telephone debt in\ncollection since December 1998 (\u00b6 1.a).\n\u2022\nA $1,608 past due balance on an automobile loan had been placed for\ncollection in about April 2004 (not alleged).\n\u2022\nA retail charge account with a high credit of $555 was placed for collection\nin October 2000. That account had a past due balance of $715 as of June\n2004 as reported by a successor assignee (\u00b6 1.e).\n\u2022\nA retail charge account with a high credit of $1,310 had been placed for\ncollection in 2002 and had a past due balance of $2,165 as of October 2004\n(not alleged).\n\n5\n\u2022\nA personal loan was listed as past due in the amount of $1,140 on a balance\nof $1,344 delinquent since April 2002 (\u00b6 1.h). A second installment loan with\nthe same creditor, delinquent since May 2002, was reported to have a $1,268\nbalance as of September 2004. (\u00b6 1.f)\n\u2022\nA credit card account opened in September 1994 was placed for collection in\nJune 2000. As of October 2004, the debt balance was $1,475 (\u00b6 1.b)\n\u2022\nA credit card account was placed for collection in 2002 with a past due\nbalance of $560 (\u00b6 1.i.)\n\u2022\nA mortgage company was awarded a judgment against Applicant in the\namount of $1,795 in May 2003 (not alleged). A $1,711 past due balance had\nbeen in collection since September 2002. Two other accounts were listed with\nthe same lender that had been refinanced and rated \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d\n\u2022\nA credit card debt of $2,542, originally placed for collection in 2002, was\nreported as 120 days or greater past due and in collection status (\u00b6 1.g).\n\u2022\nA collection agency was reporting a debt balance of $6,460 on an individual\ninstallment loan debt placed in January 2003 (\u00b6 1.j), although it appeared to\nbe the same account as that in \u00b6 1.g. \n\u2022\nA $167 telephone services debt was listed as unpaid and in collection since\nSeptember 2004 (likely \u00b6 1.c).\n\u2022\nA cellular phone debt of $303, assigned for collection in March 2004, was\nlisted as unpaid (not alleged).\nDuring a subject interview of February 10, 2006, Applicant expressed a willingness to\nresolve his indebtedness. A subsequent check of Applicant\u2019s credit on July 31, 2006, revealed that\nApplicant had settled the $167 telephone debt (\u00b6 1.c), the $2,165 retail charge card debt, and the\n$1,608 auto loan debt.  He was reported to owe balances of $1,475 on \u00b6 1.b, $2,455 on \u00b6 1.d, $907\non \u00b6 1.e, $871 to the assignee of \u00b6 1.i (also listed as $560 to the original creditor), $2,367 on \u00b6 1.g,\nand $1,711 to the mortgage company, which had been awarded a judgment of $1,795 (not alleged).\nTwo other accounts with the same lender were listed as closed or paid.\nOn September 25, 2006, in response to financial interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant\nprovided evidence showing that he owed a zero balance on a loan with the mortgage company, but\non an account that had been closed with a zero balance as of November 2001.  As for the computer\ndebt in collection since March 2002 (\u00b6 1.d) and the $871 credit card debt in collection since\nSeptember 2002 (\u00b6 1.i), Applicant indicated he had arranged to repay the debts, at $50 to $100 per\nmonth on the former and $50 per month on the latter. He indicated he had paid the $50 telephone\ndebt (\u00b6 1.a) in March 2006, the $1,608 delinquent balance of the automobile loan in February 2006\n(not alleged), the $907 retail debt (\u00b6 1.e) in September 2006, and the $1,475 credit card debt (\u00b6 1.b)\nin March 2006. He also maintained that he had paid the $506 charged off balance originally owed\n\nThe credit report of July 31, 2006, shows the original debt balance of $560 placed in collection. A collection\n3\nagency reported a debt of $560 placed in September 2002 which had an updated balance of $871, so these appear to be\nthe same account.\nWhile the credit bureau reported a $281 balance owed on a telephone debt in collection (\u00b6 1.c), it indicated\n4\nin the collection section under the name of the original creditor that a settlement had been accepted on the account.\n6\non \u00b6 1.i,  and that he had settled the $2,165 retail debt (not alleged) in early 2006. Applicant claimed\n3\nnot to recognize some of the debts that had been on his credit report, i.e., the $1,268 (\u00b6 1.f), $1,344\n(\u00b6 1.h), $1,711 (not alleged), $2,367 (\u00b6 1.g), and $6,460 (\u00b6 1.j). He indicated he had zero balances\non two other accounts (the $281 and $303 collection balances), but provided no payment dates.\nApplicant furnished DOHA with a personal financial statement reflecting net monthly income with\nhis spouse\u2019s salary of $3,400, monthly expenses of $2,000, and debt payments of $100 on \u00b6 1.d and\n$500 to \u00b6 1.i.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 28, 2006, showed outstanding balances of $1,475\non \u00b6 1.b, $2,501 on \u00b6 1.d, $921 on \u00b6 1.e, $2,367 on \u00b6 1.g, and $2,112 on the installment loan with\nthe mortgage company (not alleged).  The credit bureau reported the debt in \u00b6 1.i as settled and\n4\nfailed to substantiate the alleged outstanding balances of \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j.\nIn answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that the debts alleged had been paid in full or\nsettled, although he contested the amount of the debt in \u00b6 1.j.  A subsequent credit report of March\n7, 2007, confirmed Applicant had brought the balance of \u00b6 1.g down to $192, but  the computer debt\n(\u00b6 1.d) had increased to $2,527, and he still owed a delinquent balance of $1,475 on \u00b6 1.b. Applicant\nwas also reported to owe a charged off balance of $1,711 as of February 2007 to the mortgage lender.\nThe previously reported delinquent balance of $921 (\u00b6 1.e) was no longer on his credit report.\n \nConcerning the alleged falsification of his SF 86 for failure to disclose his financial\ndelinquencies in response to question 38 (financial delinquencies over 180 days in the past seven\nyears), Applicant stated on January 5, 2007:\nSeven years prior to 2004 I was almost sure that I was not over 180 days delinquent\non any accounts that I knew of. I in no way deliberately disclosed info. Even though\nI experiend [sic] a short period of unemployment during the period of 2002-2003 I\ntried to keep all accounts up to date. All accounts are up to date and/or paid in full\nas of Dec. 2006. Credit report may not be accurate and updated.\nHe also denied deliberate falsification of question 39 (debts currently over 90 days delinquent) on\nhis October 2004 SF 86, explaining that \u201csome accounts were brought to [his] attention after the\ncompletion of the questionnaire.\u201d Applicant attributed his denial of any felony arrests to his belief\nthat he was not required to disclose the arrest since he had not been convicted (\u201cApparently I didn\u2019t\npay close enough attention to the question and since I was innocent of the charges and not convicted.\nI thought I had given the correct answer.\u201d).\nIn rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant indicated on April 9, 2007, that he \u201csimply slippled [sic]\non a few accounts hoping to make up the payments the next billing cycle.\u201d Citing commuting costs\nand car expenses that have since been reduced, he expressed his intent to get accounts up to date,\n\n7\nalthough he also indicated that he had cleared or paid most accounts. Applicant denied any validity\nto the 1997 felony charge and averred he had been cleared after he took a lie detector test (\u201cI was at\nthe wrong place, in the wrong situation, and it should have never happened.\u201d).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18). A credit bureau reported in November 2004 that\nApplicant owed about $22,685 in delinquent debt. In his response to interrogatories, he claimed in\nSeptember 2006 to not recognize the indebtedness alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and  to owe nothing\nto the creditor reportedly awarded a $1,795 judgment. His July 2006 credit report showed balances\nof $2,367 on \u00b6 1.g and $1,711 to the mortgage financier (not alleged), but the others he questioned\nwere not listed on his more recent credit reports. The government suggests those debts were likely\n\u201cdropped off\u201d because of the length of time they had gone unpaid, but provided no support for such\nan inference. Favorable findings are returned as to those debts not adequately established. Yet, there\nis sufficient substantiation of the delinquent debt totaling about $9,786 as of July 2006 ($1,475 \u00b6 1.b,\n$2,455 \u00b6 1.d, $907 \u00b61.e, $2,367 \u00b6 1.g, $871 \u00b6 1.i, and $1,711 to the mortgage company for a loan\nthat was not alleged). Potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply. His sizeable consumer\n\n8\ncredit debt implicates DC 19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/other\nfinancial analysis.\nApplicant cited his unemployment as well as vehicle repair and commuting expenses as\ncauses of his indebtedness. Lack of income is an extenuating circumstance contemplated within\nmitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), but most of these debts became delinquent between\n1998 and 2003 when Applicant was gainfully employed as a facility technician for the telephone\ncompany.  In response to the FORM, Applicant admitted he had  \u201cneglected the importance of credit\nand accounts.\u201d  While subsequent unemployment from June 2003 to September 2004 is a factor that\nextenuates his failure to address his debts during that time, Applicant is required to act responsibly\nunder the circumstances for MC \u00b6 20(b) to apply. Responsible financial behavior includes arranging\nto repay indebtedness when in a position to do so. Before the SOR was issued, he paid and/or settled\nfor less than the full balance the $50 telephone debt (\u00b6 1.a), a department store charge debt of $2,165\nand the $1,608 delinquent auto loan balance (neither debt alleged), the $560 credit card debt\n(collection balance $871 \u00b6 1.i), as well as the debt in \u00b6 1.c. By March 2007, he had reduced the\nbalance of the debt in \u00b6 1.g from $2,542 to only $192.\nThere is a valid basis to apply MC \u00b6 20(d), the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and findings are returned for Applicant as to\nthose debts that have been settled. Nonetheless, I am unable to conclude that his financial\nmismanagement is safely in the past. Although  the Directive does not require that he be debt free,\nhis claims of monthly payments on the computer (\u00b6 1.d), and of satisfaction of  \u00b6 1.b are not\nsupported in the record. His March 2007 credit report also shows a delinquent balance of $1,711\nowed the mortgage lender on an account ending in 9301. While he provided evidence showing a zero\nbalance on an account with that lender, the principal balance of that loan (ending in 9901) was paid\noff in December 2001 by a new loan. The credit reports show the account ending in 9901 was\nrefinanced, and the delinquent account, which ends in 9301, was not opened until September 2002.\nThe latest credit reports lists unaddressed delinquency in excess of $5,700 and Applicant has failed\nto prove that he does not owe it.\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct and Guideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. (AG \u00b6 30). In the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged Applicant committed criminal\nconduct because of his arrests in December 1997 for felony sexual assault and in May 1997 for\ndomestic violence/disorderly conduct, his receipt of non-judicial punishment in July 1996 for assault\non his spouse, and sodomy and adultery with a female service member, and his knowing and willful\nconcealment of his felony arrest and delinquent debts from his SF 86. Applicant maintains his\ninnocence of the December 1997 felony charge. He did not respond to the alleged domestic violence\ncharge filed in May 1997. The government did not meet its burden of proving misconduct in either\ninstance, even though a criminal arrest is enough to trigger DC \u00b6 31(c), allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or\nconvicted. Applicant\u2019s commanding officer determined the May 1996 domestic assault and sodomy\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides in part:\n5\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and\nwillfully: (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes\nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false\nwriting or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n9\nand adultery between January and April 1996 warranted  non-judicial punishment that Applicant\nchose to not appeal, and DC \u00b6 31(a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies\nbecause of that misconduct.\nConsideration of MC \u00b6 32(c), evidence that the person did not commit the offense, is\nwarranted, given Applicant was not convicted of either of the 1997 charges and culpability was not\notherwise proven. As for the 1996 offenses, ten years have passed with no recurrence, which would\nbe sufficient to satisfy the first prong of MC 32(a), so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, but for the fact\nthat this misconduct cannot be viewed in isolation from his more recent felonious false statements.\nApplicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 21 on his October 2004 SF 86 about whether he had\never been charged with or convicted of a felony offense, even though he had been arrested for a\nfelony sexual assault in December 1997. He denied deliberately falsifying that question, and\nindicated that he thought he had responded correctly since he had not been convicted. Although the\nquestion is unambiguous in its language requiring disclosure of any charge or conviction, a good\nfaith mistake as to what was required could negate the intent required for a deliberate falsification.\nWhen he answered the SOR, Applicant also indicated that he apparently had not paid close enough\nattention to the question. I accept his explanation and accordingly find that he did not knowingly\nfalsify question 21.\nHowever, given the extent of his financial delinquency as reflected in his November 2004\ncredit report, Applicant\u2019s claim that as of his October 2004 SF 86  he \u201cwas almost sure that [he] was\nnot over 180 days delinquent on any accounts that [he] knew of,\u201d is not plausible. While he may not\nhave known the specific delinquent balances, he has not disputed that he was seriously in debt\n($2,455 for a computer placed for collection in March 2002, $50 for a telephone debt in collection\nfrom 1998 until he paid it in March 2006; $1,608 on a car loan that he apparently settled in February\n2006; $907 on a collection debt placed in April 2002 and not paid off until 2006; $1,475 on a credit\ncard that was charged off in June 2000; and $560 on a revolving charge placed in November 2002.\nMoreover, in his response to the FORM, Applicant admitted that he had \u201cneglected the importance\nof credit and accounts before,\u201d that \u201caccounts were not paid because of fear of losing employment.\u201d\nThe objective evidence confirms not only that he had been 180 days past due on several accounts in\nthe seven years preceding his clearance application, but that he was then over 90 days delinquent.\nHis debt problems went beyond merely slipping on a few accounts hoping to make up in the next\nbilling cycle. Applicant committed a felony violation of \u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately omitting\nrelevant and material information concerning his indebtedness from his SF 86.   DC 31(c) of the\n5\nCriminal Conduct guideline applies. His misrepresentations also raise Personal Conduct concerns\n(see AG \u00b6 15, Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\n\n10\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. Under Guideline E,  DC \u00b6 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities, is pertinent.\nI am unable to conclude that he is successfully rehabilitated from the Criminal Conduct or\nPersonal Conduct concerns where he remains unwilling to acknowledge the deliberate falsification\nof his SF 86. His failure to provide a credible explanation for his negative responses to questions 38\nand 39 casts continuing doubt on his judgment and trustworthiness, and reflects a lack of remorse.\nHe has not satisfied Guideline J MC \u00b6 32(d), there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution,\njob training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nNor has he shown the prompt, good faith effort at rectification required for favorable consideration\nof Guideline E MC \u00b6 17(a), the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. AG \u00b6 2(a) Some of his\naccounts had been in collection for six years before he began to address them (\u00b6 2(a)(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct). Although he has recently settled and/or paid several of the\ndelinquencies (\u00b6 2(a)(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges), his uncorroborated claims of having made payments on others (\u00b6 1.b, \u00b6 1.d) are difficult\nto accept when he has not been fully candid about his financial situation. Little confidence can be\nplaced in his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of his well-documented financial\nirresponsibility and his false statements.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR, as amended:\nParagraph 1.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant mitigated financial security concerns relating to delinquent debts and his Chapter\n13 bankruptcy discharged in 2000. He was in bankruptcy process since 1997, and incurred additional\n\n2\ndebt that became delinquent during a one year period of unemployment in 2002 after the bankruptcy\nwas completed. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn November 6, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 8, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on January 10,\n2007, for a hearing on January 26, 2007, and held that day. The government offered in evidence six\nexhibits and Applicant offered seven. All were admitted. The transcript was received on February\n5, 2007. The record was left open until March 2,2007, for the submission of additional materials.\nTwo post-hearing submissions were received and admitted without objection. The first consisted of\nseven items and the second of three. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the specifics of all of the SOR allegations relating to bankruptcy and eight\ndelinquent debts of almost $10,000. After a complete review of the record, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor where he has been employed\nsince December 2004 as a security guard. In 1997 he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy and after a\nnumber of payments under a plan for $9,000 in debts, his bankruptcy was converted to Chapter 7 in\nApril 1999, and discharged in March 2000 (Exh. F). Since then he was unemployed for almost a year\nin 2002 during which time other debts accumulated and became delinquent leading to this matter.\nApplicant was divorced in 2002 and remarried in 2003. His annual salary is $26,000 and his\nwife\u2019s is $35,000. They work for the same government contractor. He has four children two of whom\nare adults by his first wife and two small children by his second wife. \nThe following is an analysis of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR and their current\nstatus:\n\n3\n1. Par. 1.a.: Bankruptcy filed in 1997 and discharged in 2000. \n2. Par. 1.b: Tax lien for $167 filed in 1998. Exh. B indicates that there is no outstanding tax\nlien. \n3. Par. 1.c.: Credit card debt of $1,823. Payments of $60 per month made over a year\nreducing debt to $800 (Exh. G and Exhs. B and C of Second Post-Hearing Submission). \n4. Par. 1.d.:Card debt for $4,021. Settled for less and payments made of $50 per month (Exh.\nE). \n5. Par. 1.e.:Credit card debt of $1,883. Applicant erroneously believed it was included in\nbankruptcy but is now paid under a settlement agreement (Exhs. B and C. of Second Post\nHearing Submission). \n6. Par. 1.f.: Credit card debt of $1,089. Government stipulated debt has been paid (Exh. C).\n7. Par. 1.g.:Credit card debt of $628. Paid in full (Exh. D). \n8. Par. 1.h.:Account for $56 dental bill and government stipulated that it had been paid (Tr.\n50).\nApplicant is well regarded by his company for his work as a well-motivated, competent\nperformer who meets objectives (Exhs. F, Second Post Hearing Submission). He is active in his\nchurch and tithes regularly. He wife and he have a budget plan to which they adhere. He does not\nnow have a credit card. He and his wife have rental payments with a housing facility that bases the\npayments on their income. He has modest auto payments. He recently received a $5,000 tax refund\nwhich permits him to settle in full the remaining accounts on which he is making payment. \nApplicant served on active duty with the Army for ten years and was discharged as an E 5.\nHe hoped to stay in the Army but was discharged for unsatisfactory performance. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n4\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concerns under Guideline\nF since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude a history of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.), and evidence of inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) might include the fact that\nthe person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n(E2.A6.1.3.6.)\nWhile Applicant had one bankruptcy that was discharged seven years ago, he incurred other\ndebts because of his unemployment. He now has changed his practices regarding budgeting and does\nnot use credit cards, which led to his recent problems. He is a responsible family man. \nMitigating conditions apply since the problems have now been resolved to the satisfaction\nof nearly all the creditors with the ability to resolve those that remain through payment programs in\neffect. An applicant is not required to prove that all delinquent debts are resolved to be granted a\nsecurity clearance, but only that efforts be made to resolve the debts and to show that the matters are\nbeing diligently pursued with an ability to resolve them. From the documentation submitted by\nApplicant, I have no difficulty in making that determination. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that a security clearance should\nbe granted.\n\n5\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1.

She has successfully mitigated the government\u2019s\nconcerns about her finances under guideline F. Eligibility is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 24, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On January 3, 2007,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA\nrecommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a\nposition of trust should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On January 22, 2007, Applicant\nsubmitted a notarized response to the allegations. She requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on March 7, 2007, and issued a notice of hearing on May 17,\n2007. At the hearing on June 6, 2007, the Department Counsel, on behalf of the government, filed\na motion to amend the SOR to correct the date of issuance of the SOR. The SOR reflected an issuance\ndate of January 3, 2006 instead of January 3, 2007. Applicant did not object. I granted the motion and\nthe SOR issuance dated is amended to reflect January 3, 2007. The government submitted six exhibits\n(GE) which were marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6, without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted five exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App Ex A-E, without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. I held the record open for the Applicant to submit\nadditional evidence, which she timely did. She submitted six additional documents, which are marked\nand admitted as App Ex F-K, without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June\n25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits all the allegations, except subparagraph 1.d, under\nGuideline F in the SOR. She denies the allegation in subparagraph 1.d of the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s\n2\n\nGE 1(Applicant\u2019s application for a position of public trust, dated August 24, 2004) at 1, 3; Tr. at 17, 44.\n3\nTr. at 16-18, 20, 40.\n4\n Id. at 19; GE 1, supra note 3, at 3.\n5\nApp Ex J (Earnings statement for March, April and May 2007); Tr. at 19-21, 45-47.\n6\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated October 8, 2004); GE 4 (Credit report, dated November 23, 2005); GE 5 (Credit\n7\nreport, dated August 22, 2006); GE 6 (Credit report, dated February 28, 2007).\n3\nadmissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant, a 44-year-old woman employed as a document control clerk in the mail room of\na Department of Defense contractor, seeks a position of public trust. The contractor hired her six years\nago.3\nApplicant graduated from high school and attended technical school for one year. She is the\nsingle mother of five daughters, between the ages of 15 and 28. Her sixth daughter died at birth in\nNovember 2000. Two daughters still live at home, with one attending college. She currently lives with\nher mother, who is being treated for cancer. She and her siblings take turns caring for her mother. She\nis to be married soon.4\nIn November 2000, Applicant\u2019s then employer laid her off in a reduction in force. She started\nher current position in June 2001. Although she received unemployment, her job loss impacted her\nability to pay her bills.5\nApplicant currently earns $9.27 an hour and usually works a 40 hour week. She occasionally\nworks overtime, but not more than 4 hours in a month. Her gross monthly salary is approximately\n$1,484, and her net monthly income is approximately $1,290. She receives $600 a month in food\nstamps. Since she lives with her mother, she does not pay rent. Her other monthly expenses total\napproximately $825. She pays her expenses with cash and does not use credit cards.6\nA review of Appellant\u2019s credit reports dated October 8, 2004, November 23, 2005, August\n22, 2006, February 28, 2007, and the SOR shows 13 unpaid debts totaling $18,113.  The current\n7\nstatus of these debts is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nACCOUNT/AMOUNT\nSTATUS\nEVIDENCE\n1.a.\nCredit card           $1,726\nStatue of Limitations\n1.b.\nCredit card           $2,428\nStatute of Limitations\n1.c.\nCredit card           $2,078\nStatute of Limitations\n1.d.\nCredit card           $2,668\nChallenged, removed from\ncredit report\nGE 5, p.2; GE 6, p.1-2;\nApp Ex B\n\nApp Ex A (Copies of payments to creditor); Tr. at 22-27, 31, 42-43, 47-48.\n8\nApp Ex F (Letter dated June 6, 2007); App Ex G (Performance evaluations dated January 2006 and February\n9\n2007); App Ex H (Confidentiality agreement); and App Ex I (Employee Profile, dated January 23, 2007).\n4\n1.e.\nPhone bill            $   310\nPaid one-half; Statute of\nLimitations\nApp Ex K\n1.f.\nPersonal loan       $1,519\nStatute of Limitations,\ncontacted\nTr. at 29-30\n1.g.\nPersonal loan       $1,958\nUnpaid\n1.h.\nCar loan               $2,555\nPaid\nApp Ex C\n1.i.\nHospital bill         $   187\nPaid all accounts\nApp Ex D; Tr. at 38\n1.j\nPersonal loan       $   880\nUnpaid, contacted\nTr. at 38\n1.k.\nPersonal loan       $   681\nUnpaid, contacted\nTr. at 38\n1.l\nPersonal loan       $   838\nUnpaid, contacted\nTr. at 38\n1.m.\nPersonal loan       $   285\nPaid\nGE 6, p.2; App Ex E\nApplicant began paying on two credit card debts in November 2006. She paid a total of $500\non these cards before she stopped her payments. Her credit cards, which are with the same credit\ncompany, had a $500 limit, which she had reached when she could not longer continue her payments.\nShe believes the remaining charges on each of her accounts is interest and late fees. She contacted\nthe creditor and inquired about settlement of these debts. The creditor refused to discus settlement.\nShe stated that the debt in allegation 1.f. was originally $3,000 and that she made payments on the\ndebt for sometime, before she defaulted. Approximately one month ago, she contacted a credit\ncounseling service by telephone. She called several creditors, and subsequently agreed to begin paying\n$50 a month as soon as she can.8\nIn her evaluations for the last four years, Applicant\u2019s performance has been rated sometimes\nexceed expectations on three occasions and once at consistently exceeds expectations. She is a\nconsistent high producer with a low error rate. She volunteers to take on additional work\nresponsibilities and is viewed as an asset to the organization. As part of her employment, her\nemployer required her to sign a confidentiality agreement to protect its confidential information. If\nshe does not, she can be fired.9\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b62(a)(1)-(9).\n10\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n11\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., December 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n12\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against a trustworthiness determination is not outcome determinative, the\nrevised AG should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In\naddition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these\nare: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.10\nThe sole purpose of a trustworthiness determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties to an applicant.  The\n11\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify\nthe applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The burden of proof is\n12\nsomething less than a preponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the\n13\nburden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome\nthe case against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n14\nfavorable clearance decision.  Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be\n15\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative\nguidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n16\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n17\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n18\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\n\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n19\n Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n20\n6\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n19\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. Any\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n20\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect several old,\nlarge, unpaid debts. Because of the age of these debts and their delinquent status, Applicant showed\nan inability or unwillingness to pay her debts. Based on the evidence of record, the government\nestablished the applicability of DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c)\na history of not meeting financial obligations.\nIn 2000, Applicant lost her job about the same time her youngest daughter died. Until this time,\nshe managed to pay her debts. It took her eight months to find other employment. With the loss of her\njob, she slowly fell behind in her credit payments. She, however, continued to pay the bills she could\npay. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances applies.\nApplicant called a financial counseling company, but has not retained their services to help\nwith the repayment of her debts. She, however, contacted many of her creditors on her own and made\narrangements to pay her debts. MC \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control may\nhave some application as indicated in the discussion of MC \u00b6 20(d).\nMC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts apply. Applicant paid three of her debts, which eliminated $3,027 of unpaid debt. She\nalso paid $500 on two other old debts, before she stopped paying. Although a promise to pay by itself\nis insufficient to establish a good faith effort, her agreements with three additional creditors to make\nmonthly payments is given some weight as she has methodically worked to pay her debts. With her\nlimited income, she can only repay her debts one at a time. She has made a good faith effort to resolve\nher old debts.\n\nBecause she made payments totaling $500 on two of her credit cards, the statute of limitations may have\n21\nrestarted from the date of her last payment on these debts.\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n22\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nMore than $8,000 of her old debt may be barred from collection under state law.  Thus, she\n21\ndoes receive some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the application of the 3-year South\nCarolina statute of limitations, which may apply to her five largest unpaid SOR debts. See S.C. Code.\nAnn. \u00a7 15-3-530.  The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial\n22\nvalue of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App.\n2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nElimination of her delinquent debt through the statute of limitations has ended her potential\nvulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer \u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d\nbut it does not negate her past conduct in accumulating debt which she could not pay. Because she is\nno longer legally responsible for these debts, it is reasonable and responsible for her not to pay these\ndebts since any payment would revive the debt.\nMC \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the\ndispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue applies to allegation 1.d of the SOR.\nApplicant denied owing the debt in allegation 1.d. She challenged this information on her credit report,\nand the creditor agreed to remove it from her credit report. Thus, she has eliminated an additional\n$2,668 of debt. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\n\n8\nApplicant is a single mother whose income is limited. She has raised five children on her own,\nwhile working. She paid her bills until she lost her job in 2000. Eight months later she started her\ncurrent employment. The loss of income made it difficult for Applicant to keep up with her bills. Even\nafter she obtained employment, her limited income prevented her from repaying her unpaid debts,\nsome of which were originally around $500, but now are in excess of $2,000 because of high fees and\ninterest charges. In the last six years, she has worked regularly and supported her children until they\nwere old enough to be on their own. She is a reliable and dependable employee and parent. She pays\nher current bills and refuses to use credit cards. She lives with her mother. She does not live\nextravagantly. Despite her income, she has made an effort to repay her debts, one at a time. She has\nnot incurred excessive unpaid debt in the last three years. The record lacks any evidence that she\nresorted to illegal activities to obtain money to pay her bills.\nApplicant performs her duties exceptionally well, is respected by her co-workers for her\nreliability, dependability and honesty, and is valued by her employer.  She has not violated company\nrules during her years of employment and complies with the rules of society. I have weighed the\nmitigating factors, the reasons for her debts, her current family situation, her efforts to maintain a home\nfor her children, and the positive recommendations against her inability to pay her old debts. I find that\nthe overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that she is a person of integrity, who is trustworthy.\nShe would not act in a manner which would harm her employer or the government. There is little\nlikelihood she would violate the privacy rights she has agreed to protect because of her existing debt\nproblems. I conclude she has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial\nconsiderations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-m:\n    For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

He attended a university in the United\nStates in 1996 and became a naturalized citizen in 2002.  His children were born in the United States.\nHe has worked for a federal contractor since 2004.  His mother is a resident and citizen of Hong\nKong.  Recently, he destroyed his current Chinese passport in the presence of his security officer.\nHe did not mitigate the security concerns raised by foreign influence or preference, but did mitigate\nthose raised under personal conduct.  He is barred from holding a security clearance under the\nASDC\u00b3 Memorandum.  Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 5, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA).  The Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 14, 2006, detailing the basis\nfor its decision-security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence), C (Foreign\nPreference) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005,\nand implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. \nOn December 15, 2006, Applicant filed a response to the SOR, admitting all of the\nallegations, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  On\nJanuary 30, 2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing\nfive Government Exhibits (GX), and mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 5, 2007. The\nFORM also contained nine documents for which Department Counsel requested that I take\nadministrative notice.  Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation or mitigation.  Applicant received the FORM on February 13,\n2007, and submitted additional information on March 13, 2007.  He did not object to the introduction\nof the documents offered for administrative notice.  Department Counsel did not object to\nApplicant\u2019s additional submission.  The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2007.  After\nreviewing the nine documents submitted for administrative notice, I take notice of the information\ncontained therein.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his response to the SOR, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old married man.  He was born in the Peoples Republic of China\n(PRC).  He attended a university in the United States from 1996 to 1997 when he was awarded an\nadvanced degree.  He became a naturalized U.S.citizen in June 2002.  Since October 2004, he has\n1\n\nId. at 2.\n2\nId. at 4-5.\n3\nId. at 6.\n4\nLetter dated March 12, 2007.\n5\nGX 4 at 6.\n6\nLetter contained in documents submitted on or about March 20, 2007.\n7\nLetter dated March 19, 2007.\n8\nGX 3 and 5.\n9\nLetter dated March 12, 2007.\n10\n3\nworked for a federal contractor.   He completed a security clearance application (SCA) in April 2005.\n2\nApplicant\u2018s wife was born in Taiwan in 1967.  She became a U.S. citizen in December 1988.\nThey have two children, both born in the United States.  His in-laws are naturalized U.S. citizens.3\nHe does not have any financial interests in foreign property.   In his March 12, 2007 letter, he stated,\n4\n\u201cI am a U.S. Citizen and I am proud for that. I never indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States it was because United States is my country.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in the PRC.  His father is deceased and his mother is a citizen\nand resident of Hong Kong.  He is one of two children, both born in PRC.  His sister is a naturalized\ncitizen and resident of the United States.  His father-in-law and mother-in-law are naturalized U.S.\ncitizens and residents.\nOver the course of the past seven years, Applicant traveled to Canada once on business in\n1997.  It was his only trip out of the United States in 17 years.  At the time, he used his Hong Kong\n5\npassport that was issued in 1997 because he did not have a U.S. passport.  His Hong Kong passport\nexpires in September 2007.   After being notified that possessing a current foreign passport created\n6\nsecurity concerns, Applicant mailed it to DOHA for destruction, but DOHA returned it to him\nbecause DOHA is not authorized to accept it.  He subsequently ripped it up in front of his security\n7\nofficer on March 19, 2007, and mailed a picture of it along with a confirming letter from his\ncompany security officer.8\nIn August 2002 and March 2004, Applicant was arrested for Domestic Spousal Battery.  Both\ncharges were dismissed.  The incidents arose after his wife, who suffers from a seemingly difficult\ncase of bipolar disorder, called the police during an argument about her refusal to take prescribed\nmedication.   When he completed his SCA, he failed to disclose the two arrests in response to\n9\nQuestion 26. Your Police Record - Other Offenses, because he misunderstood the question.  He did\nnot realize he was required to disclose any arrest regardless of the outcome of the case.  After\nspeaking to an investigator, he realized he made a mistake in not listing the two incidents.10\nI take administrative notice of the nine Administrative Notice Exhibits submitted by\nDepartment Counsel that pertain to the PRC and Hong Kong.  The Government\u2019s documents, when\n\n4\nreviewed in their entirety, indicate that since July 1, 1997, Hong Kong has been designated as a\nSpecial Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC, a totalitarian state ruled by the Chinese\nCommunist Party, and that Hong Kong is subject to the PRC in matters of defense and foreign\naffairs.  The Government\u2019s documents also note that the PRC has exercised active and historic roles\nas a collector of competitive information and as a perpetrator of industrial espionage against U.S.\ncompanies producing militarily critical technologies such as information systems, sensors and lasers,\nand electronics.  In addition, the PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria which must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility.  Within the Revised Guidelines are factors to consider in denying or revoking\nan individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and factors\nto consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions).  By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual.  Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information.  Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. Directive, Enclosure 2,\n\u00b6 E2.2.2.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about\nan applicant\u2019s loyalty. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988).  The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  ISCR Case\nNo. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d Id. \nBased upon the allegations contained in the SOR and a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole, the following revised adjudicative guidelines are pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this\ncase:\n\n5\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence): The Concern -Foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder this Guideline should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact\nor financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the\nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference): The Concern -When an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct): The Concerns - Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter considering all facts in evidence and legal standards, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, I conclude the following in regard to the allegations contained in the SOR:\nGuideline B: Foreign Influence\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admission that his mother is a resident citizen of Hong Kong, the\nGovernment established a disqualifying condition under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition\n(FI DC) 7(b) \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing the information.\u201d\nWhile family ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying\nunder Guideline B, such ties do raise a prima facie security concern.  This concern is sufficient to\nrequire an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the\napplicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance.  ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nApplicant\u2019s case requires the recognition that the PRC, a totalitarian regime, exercised\ngovernmental control over Hong Kong and is able to use that control if it so wishes to obtain,\nthrough illegal methods, militarily critical technologies from companies doing business as\ngovernment contractors in the United States.  These actions threaten U.S. security interests.\nAmerican citizens with immediate family members who are citizens or residents of Hong Kong\ncould be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nThe Government having established a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nrebut or mitigate the allegations.  After considering all mitigating conditions under this guideline,\n\n6\n8(a)-(f), I conclude none of them apply, as Applicant failed to provide any information pertinent to\ntheir application.\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference\nPossession of Chinese Passport\nThe Memorandum of Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur L. Money, dated August 16,\n2000, hereinafter \u201cASDC\u00b3 Memorandum\u201d mandates that \u201cconsistent application of the guideline\nrequires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport\nor obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States\nGovernment.\u201d  However, the passport cannot be surrendered to a Department of Defense security\nofficer.  It must be surrendered to the issuing authority.  ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 3-5 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 28, 2005).  Although Applicant demonstrated his intent to surrender his current passport, he\nmust notify the appropriate authority of his intentions, and thereafter be divested of all opportunity\nto hold the passport.  Hence, I conclude that the ASDC3 memorandum bars Applicant\u2019s clearance\nbecause he did not properly notify Hong Kong, the issuing authority, of his intention to surrender\nhis rights to hold a foreign passport.  Hence, the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 2.a are concluded\nagainst him.\nA discussion of disqualifying and mitigating conditions is not necessary, given the strict\napplicability of the above memo.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleged a potential disqualification under Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) \u201c the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status\ndetermines security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d SOR\n\u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by failing to disclose the 2002 and 2004 arrests.\nAlthough Applicant admitted he did not disclose the information, he denied that he intentionally\nattempted to deceive the Government.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)\n(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant\u2019s explanation that he misunderstood Question 26, requiring him to disclose the two\narrests regardless of their dismissal, is credible.  That confusion is typical for many applicants, and\nonce he learned he should have listed the information, he readily admitted he made a mistake.\nHence, I conclude he did not intentionally falsify the SCA as alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a.\n\n7\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the guideline, the\nadjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information\nabout the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1 describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the conduct of an applicant, an administrative judge should\nconsider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation,\nand behavior changes, etc., the eighth factor in this series is the most relevant. \nThe Appeal Board suggests that the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative\nto his ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by\nthe facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \nIn the present case, there is a dearth of information about positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s\nlife as a U.S. citizen that could weigh in favor of granting him a security clearance, in response to\nthe disqualification under Guideline B.  Essentially, the only pertinent evidence in the record is\ninformation that he has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for five years, his wife and her family are\nnaturalized citizens, and his children were born in the United States.  He also claims he is a patriotic\nU.S. citizen and does not have a criminal record or unresolved financial problems.  Consequently,\nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate those security concerns raised under foreign\ninfluence.  The allegations raised under Guideline B are found against him. \nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided for him, and Guidelines B and C are decided against\nhim.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nAGAINST Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Application for public trust\nposition is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\ntrustworthiness position for Applicant. On February 1, 2007, under Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5200.6, with revised Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its security concerns\nraised under the financial considerations guideline (Guideline F), and the personal conduct guideline\n(Guideline E) of the Directive. In her answer dated February 23, 2007, Applicant requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on March 28, 2007. She received the FORM on April\n7, 2007. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due by May 7, 2007. No response was received. The\ncase was assigned to me for decision on June 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges financial considerations and personal conduct. Applicant admitted in her\nanswer (Item 3) seven of eight factual allegations under the financial guideline. She denied\nsubparagraph 1.f. indicating she paid the debt on January 25, 2007. I find against Applicant under\nsubparagraph 1.f. as she provided no documentation, e.g., a receipt, a bank statement, a statement\nfrom the creditor, to verify the debt had been paid. Applicant is 26 years old and employed as a Clerk\nSpecialist III for a defense contractor. She seeks a trustworthiness position. She has held nine jobs\nbetween 1999 and March 2005. \nThe eight overdue debts, consisting of credit cards and utilities, total $14,314.00. The debts\nwere converted to a delinquent status between December 2003 and October 2004. \nThe only information pertaining to the debts listed in the SOR is found in Applicant\u2019s\nanswers to interrogatories (Item 5), dated November 15, 2006, that is included in the FORM.

The government\nasked her to document any payments and/or correspondence received from the collection agency or\noriginal creditor. She provided a documented payment of $150.00 to SOR creditor 1.f. on September\n24, 2006. She noted that SOR 1.f. was the only creditor she was able to make a payment to. I find\n\n3\nher next statement, \u201cI\u2019ve come into more financial responsibilities than stated before when I first\nstarted my interview regarding these debts,\u201d is her acknowledgment she had delinquent debts which\nshe did not report in her public trust application (PTA, Item 4) in April 2005. \nThe last page of Item 5 also includes Applicant\u2019s estimate of her monthly expenses that total\nabout $1,755.00 a month, subtracted from her net monthly income of $1,800.00 a month. Applicant\nconcluded her response to Item 5 with a statement:\nI\u2019m trying my hardest to take care of my financial obligations, but with such a small\npay scale and other necessities that I have to pay for living expenses is hard to do\nwhen most of your money goes to trying to live. I will continue to take care of these\nfinancial responsibilities to the best that I can, but for now, I can only take care of one\nthing at a time. I will send more information when I can to show you that I will be\ntrying to resolve my debts. (Item 5)\nApplicant submitted her PTA (Item 4) on April 5, 2005. In response to question 20 (over 180\ndays delinquent on any loan of financial obligation), she answered \u201cNO.\u201d In her response to the\nSOR, subparagraph 2.a., Applicant provided two statements. Her first statement is \u201cI admit to\nproviding the truth when asked the question.\u201d Apparently, this statement constitutes her opinion of\nhow she answered the allegations under paragraph 1. \nHer second statement is, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the question, so I guess I admit at making this\nmistake. My apologies.\u201d I take her statement to mean that Applicant misunderstood the question. The\nvolume of information that she furnished in the security application tells me she had a reasonable\namount of time to complete the form. The four debts (subject matter of the allegation) became\ndelinquent between December 2003 and October 2004. I do not find the omissions unintentional. \nApplicant provided no character evidence regarding her job performance or her conduct away\nfrom the job. The only documentation of repayment of any of the creditors is the payment in\nSeptember 2006 to SOR 1.f.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\n\n An account reaches a delinquent status when the debtor stops making payments as required under the\n1\ncontractual terms of the account. \n4\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe focus of this guideline is handling money matters in a financially responsible manner.\nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E)\nThis guideline addresses conduct during the security investigation that involves questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness or dishonesty. \nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial accounts become delinquent  for one or two reasons. The first reason is negligence\n1\nor oversight in not paying debts. The second reason is there are matters or events outside the person\u2019s\ncontrol that keep them from paying their debts. There are financial tools, e.g., counseling,\nconsolidation plans, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, to help the debtor recover from financial trouble in a\nresponsible manner. Documented efforts of contacting the creditor to advise them of the debtor\u2019s\nplight may not seem important. On the contrary, the action shows the debtor is concerned about her\nindebtedness, and is making documented attempts to face her obligations in a responsible, mature\nmanner. A recurring failure to pay debts places the person at risk of committing acts of poor\njudgment to generate funds. The two disqualifying conditions that raise security concerns include\nfinancial considerations (FC) disqualifying conditions (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations). FC DC 19.a. is\n\n5\napplicable due to the fact eight debts totaling approximately $14,314.00 have not been paid. FC DC\n19.c. is applicable because there is a history of accounts becoming delinquent since 2003. \nOne or more of five mitigating conditions (MC) may apply to remove the security concerns\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s indebtedness. However, whether analyzed individually or collectively,\nthere is insufficient, underlying evidence to cast aside the security concerns brought on by\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties. FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability or good judgment) does not mitigate since the eight debts are\nstill delinquent, and there is no evidence demonstrating the underlying behavior leading to the\ndelinquencies has changed.\nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control, and the individual acted responsible under the circumstances) does not apply as\nthere is no evidence of sudden loss of employment or marital discord. The fact that Appellant\nchanged jobs nine times between 1999 and 2005 could be interpreted a few ways. Applicant has not\nprovided any explanations for why she changed jobs, and I cannot speculate as to the reason for the\njob changes. Accordingly, I cannot assign any extenuating or mitigating weight to FC MC 20.b. FC\nMC 20.c. (the person received or is receiving counseling and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or under control) cannot be considered either because there is no evidence\nof counseling.\nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) recognizes Applicant\u2019s partial payment to SOR 1.f. in September 2006.\nHowever, Applicant still owes the eight debts and has not provided any idea of how she intends to\nresolve the debts. Statements of intention are credible when they are followed by action. Without\nevidence showing a plan is underway to address the past due debts, Applicant has not persuaded me\nthat the FC guidelines should be found in her favor. \nThe personal conduct (PC) guideline refers to dishonesty or questionable judgment exhibited\nduring the security investigation. Applicant\u2019s omission of her past due debt information from her\nPTA falls within PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire used to determine trustworthiness). My finding is supported by (1)\nthe plain meaning of the question, (2) the recency of the delinquent debts, and (3) the volume of\ninformation Applicant provided in most sections of the PTA, specifically the sections showing her\nemployment history, and the places she lived. The PC guideline is found against Applicant. \nThe formal findings against Applicant under the FC and PC guidelines have included an\nevaluation of the circumstances of this case under the whole person concept found at paragraph 2.a.,\n2.b., and 2.c. of the Directive. Though Applicant incurred a few of the debts just after she reached\n21, she has done extremely little to repay the debts. There is no evidence she has even contacted the\ncreditors. The lack of counseling or a plan to eliminate the remaining overdue debts foreshadows\ncontinued financial problems in the future. \n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubpargraph c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph f.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph g. \nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph h.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant in a trustworthiness position.

TUIDER \n \n \nAPPEARANCES\n \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nGina Marine, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. It is too soon to tell if he will \nresolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Applicant also falsified three answers on \nhis April 2004 security clearance application by failing to list financial delinquencies and an \nOctober 1998 alcohol-related arrest. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n1\n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n \nOn April 29, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86).1 On \nNovember 6, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised.2  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on November 22, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. On May 10, 2007, the government \nmoved to amend the SOR adding two additional allegations under SOR Guideline F and seven \nallegations under Guideline E.  Without objection from the Applicant, I granted the \nGovernment\u2019s motion. Tr. 10. \n \nOn May 14, 2007, the case was assigned to me.  On May 21, 2007, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on June 12, 2007.  The hearing was held as \nscheduled.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 21, 2007. \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted without objections.  Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through M were admitted without objections. I held the record open to afford \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional material. Applicant timely submitted additional \ndocuments that were collectively marked as AE N and admitted without objections. Applicant \nsubmitted additional material after the deadline submission that were collectively marked as AE \nO and admitted over the Government\u2019s objection. \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn his response to the original SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations under \nGuideline F. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. At his hearing, Applicant \nadmitted to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p., 1.q., 2, 2.d., 2.e., 2.f., 2g., and denied 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. Tr. 12-16. After \na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n                                                          \n1GE 1.  For convenience, the security clearance application in this decision will be called SF 86.  There are \nthree separate allegations of falsification stemming from the April 29, 2004 SF 86.   \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing \napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, \nas amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n3\n                                                          \nApplicant is 26 years old.3 He graduated from high school in May 1999.  He enlisted in \nthe Marine Corps Reserves in August 1998 and completed his eight year obligated service in \nSeptember 2006 with an honorable discharge. He was activated and deployed to Iraq from \nJanuary 2003 to July 2006. Tr. 64, 88. His military occupational specialty was small computer \nsystems specialist. Tr. 89. He is unmarried with no dependents. Since October 2003, he has \nworked for his defense contractor employer and his current position is systems administrator. Tr. \n62-3. He seeks to upgrade his secret clearance to top secret. Tr. 91.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR, as amended, listed 17 debts totaling $19,044.00.  These debts are ongoing and \nhave accumulated from multiple sources over six years beginning in 2001. Viewing the facts in \nthe light most favorable to the Applicant, he was able to mitigate all of the debts except SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. (collection account in the amount of $248.00), 1.k. (collection account in the amount of \n$7,361.00), 1.p. (collection account in the amount of $3,210.00, and 1.q. (collection account in \nthe amount of $1,885.00).  These accounts remain unmitigated as a result of Applicant failing to \nsubmit adequate documentation showing he had either paid, resolved, or made progress in \npaying off the accounts. He was given notice these unpaid accounts were a security concern \nwhen interviewed in January 2006 in conjunction with his security clearance application.  Before \nissuing the November 2006 SOR, DOHA forwarded him interrogatories querying him about \nthese accounts. His September 2006 response in essence stated he had \u201cnot yet been able to \nresolve [these] debt[s].\u201d GE 2. He was also given an opportunity to submit post-hearing \ndocumentation. \n \nThe majority of these debts are medical bills, which were incurred when Applicant was \neither uninsured or underinsured. When asked by Department Counsel about how he incurred \nthese debts, he stated, \u201c. . . I believe it was also a combination of I guess being young, not having \ninsurance, and then kind of moving around somewhat. I would say I definitely showed some \nirresponsibility back in the day.\u201d Tr. 58. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nQuestion 38 of Applicant\u2019s April 29, 2004, SF 86 asks, \u201c38. Your Financial \nDelinquencies \u2013 180 Days  In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \n \nThe government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose the \ndelinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q.  \n \nQuestion 39 of Applicant\u2019s April 29, 2004, SF 86 asks, \u201c39. Your Financial \nDelinquencies \u2013 90 Days  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant \nanswered , \u201cNo.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.b. \n \n \n3GE 1, supra n 1.  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n4\n \nThe government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose the \ndelinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.q. \n \n \nQuestion 24 of Applicant\u2019s April 29, 2004, SF 86 asks, \u201c24. Your Police Record \u2013 \nAlcohol/Drug Offenses Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related \nto alcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your \ncase has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record.  The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the \ncourt issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.  \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.c. \n \n \nThe government established by substantial evidence that Applicant was convicted on \nOctober 8, 1998, and found guilty of underage possession of alcohol and fined $105.00. \nApplicant did go to court for this charge. Tr. 74.  \n \n \nApplicant stated he completed his SF 86 at work and it took a \u201ccouple of days\u201d to \ncomplete and that it took him that long because he was \u201cbusy at work.\u201d Tr. 81-83. When queried \nby Department Counsel about the accuracy of his answers, Applicant stated, \u201cRight, well, I can\u2019t \nreport something if I legitimately don\u2019t remember it as well.\u201d Tr. 84. Regarding Question 24, he \ndid not believe there was anything applicable to respond to that question. Tr. 85. Regarding \nQuestions 38 and 39, he stated, \u201cI just basically looked at everything I had current, saw that \nnothing was behind or delinquent, and answered no.\u201d  He stated it did not occur to him to list the \nmedical bills. Tr. 85-86. \n \n \nApplicant had two alcohol-related arrests after he submitted his SF 86 in April 2004. The \nfirst was for drunk in public in May 2004 for which he was assessed a fine of $25.00 and court \ncosts of $64.00. He did not have to go to court for this charge, but rather submitted his fine by \nmail. Tr. 74-75. The second was for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in November \n2004. He was found guilty of DUI, sentenced to 90 days in jail, suspended for 80 days, assessed \na fine of $500.00 and court costs of $201.00, spent five days in days in jail, and had his driver\u2019s \nlicense suspended for one year. He was also ordered to attend alcohol counseling, attend \nalcoholic anonymous meetings, and complete an alcohol safety action program. While attending \nalcohol counseling, he was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e. through 2.g. Applicant \ncomplied with all terms of his court ordered treatment program and was released from the court\u2019s \njurisdiction on January 12, 2006. Tr. 78, AE O. \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s supervisors testified on his behalf. Their testimony described his \nperformance as outstanding adding he was trustworthy. Both supervisors recommended \nApplicant for a clearance. Tr. 99-109. Applicant also submitted a recent favorable performance \nreview, a resume, and various Microsoft certificates. AE N. \n \nPOLICIES\n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an administrative \njudge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to \nClassified Information\u201d (Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n5\n                                                          \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified or sensitive information. \n \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole \nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the \nconduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final \ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information will be resolved in \nfavor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access \nto classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\n \n4 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the \npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from \nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] \nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n6\n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is because of this special \nrelationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those \nindividuals to whom it grants access to such information. Decisions under this Directive include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail \nto protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree \nof legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express \nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order \n10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS\n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n  \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n  \nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, \nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n  \n  \nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).   \n \n  \nA snapshot of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties is summarized under Financial \nConsiderations.  He has a history of financial irresponsibility going back to at least 2001. For \nreasons not entirely clear, he chose to avoid paying the 17 debts alleged in a timely manner. The \nonly aspect of Applicant\u2019s explanation for failing to address his debts that hits the mark is his \nstating he was \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Although he did make some inroads in achieving financial \nstability, he did not start the process until after he received his SOR and did not provide \nappropriate necessary documentation when provided the opportunity. \n  \n \n  \nOne Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition is potentially applicable: \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n7\n                                                          \nGuideline \u00b6 20(d).6  Other than \u00b6 20(d), Applicant did not submit evidence to warrant application \nof other mitigating factors under this Guideline. In sum, he has not demonstrated sufficient effort \nto resolve financial concerns to merit full application of any mitigating conditions to all debts \nunder the adjudicative guidelines. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Guideline \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving . . . lack of candor [or] dishonesty . . . can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the . . \n. clearance process . . . .\u201d One personal conduct disqualifying conditions is particularly relevant \nand may be disqualifying in this case. Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides, \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d   \n \nPosing potential security concerns are Applicant\u2019s documented omissions in response to \nquestions 38, 39, and 24 of his April 2004 SF 86 of financial delinquencies and his October 1998 \nalcohol-related arrest. Applicant asserts his failure to correctly answer this question was an \nhonest mistake.  His explanation does not ring true given the length of time these debts have \nbeen unpaid and the number of debts involved, i.e. 17. Furthermore, his inability to recall his \nOctober 1998 arrest, after having been to court, is not reasonable. I do not accept Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations regarding his failure to provide full, frank, and complete answers as credible. \nHowever, his 2004 alcohol-related offenses and treatment are a separate matter. \n \n  \nTwo Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification or relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d and \n\u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an \nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, \n \n \n6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-\nfaith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-\nfaith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a \nperson acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a \nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit \nof [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n8\n                                                          \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand (c).   \n \nOne Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition under Guideline \u00b6 17(c) is potentially \napplicable, \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n \nWith regard to the falsifications, no mitigating conditions under this Guideline are \napplicable.  However, with regard to the 2004 alcohol-related incidents and subsequent \nsuccessful completion of alcohol counseling, Applicant has shown sufficient rehabilitation by his \nsuccessfully complying with all terms of his court ordered treatment program and release from \nthe court\u2019s jurisdiction in January 2006. Applicant has not been involved in any further alcohol-\nrelated incidents. Accordingly, application of this mitigating condition is applicable to \u00b6\u00b6 2.d. \nthrough 2.g. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions,7 I have considered \nthe general adjudicative Guideline related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a). As \nnoted above, Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater progress resolving his delinquent debts is a \nserious, ongoing, long-term problem and is sufficiently serious to raise a trustworthiness concern. \nHis actions with respect to financial considerations were knowledgeable and voluntary.  \n \n  Applicant\u2019s record speaks for itself and establishes a lengthy documented history of not \nmeeting his financial obligations and three separate falsifications of his SF 86.  It casts doubt on \nhis reliability and trustworthiness.   \n \nApplicant presented some extenuating and mitigating evidence pertaining to his financial \nconsiderations. The current process has made him aware of the necessity to ensure his finances are \nnot delinquent. \u201cApplicant is now alert to the security concerns presented by [his] circumstances \nand the responsibilities incumbent on [him] as a result.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 26, 2006). The absence of evidence of any prior violation of his employer\u2019s rules or \nrequirements, and his evident sincerity about making future financial progress all weigh in his \nfavor.  \n \nIn sum, however, the likelihood of recurrence remains because insufficient evidence was \npresented demonstrating sustained improvement in his overall financial situation. His recent \nefforts discussed above, however, to resolve my doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment.  His falsification of his SF 86 seriously undermines the security clearance \nadjudication process. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7See generally ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under the \ngood faith mitigating condition for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n9\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations. The evidence leaves me with doubts as \nto his security clearance eligibility and suitability.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and supporting evidence, \nmy application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of \nmy  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s \ncase. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to a security clearance. \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAISNT APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n                                                          \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 46 years old and works as a system administrator for a defense contractor. He\nwas born in Libya, and his immediate family remains in that country as citizens and residents.\n\n2\nBecause he presented no facts about his family, he failed to mitigate security concerns arising from\nforeign influence. Clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted seven items in support of its contention.\n2\nItem 1 (Applicant's Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated May 25, 2005) at 1-34.\n3\nId.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant Statements of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nIn a sworn statement, dated October 23, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government's written case on January 23, 2007, and provided a complete copy of the\nfile of relevant material (FORM)  to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections\n2\nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received\nthe FORM on February 1, 2007. Applicant did not submit any additional information. The case was\nassigned to me on March 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline\nB (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f). Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nfact:\nSince 1991, Applicant who is  46-years-old, has worked as a system administrator for a\ndefense contractor. He was born in Libya in 1960, and was raised and educated in that country.\nHowever, he came to the United States to study for his undergraduate degree. He received a degree\nin computer sciences in 1997. He submitted a security clearance application on May 25, 2005.3\nWhile in Libya, Applicant married a Tunisian woman. He was divorced in 1995 in the United\nStates. He remarried an American woman, but they are now divorced. He and his wife have four\nchildren who are United States citizens by birth. He became a naturalized citizen on October 6, 1988,\nand was issued a U.S. passport in 2002. 4\nOver the years, Applicant has traveled extensively. Between 1995 and 2005, he took several\ninternational trips for business (United Kingdom), and returned to Tunisia for pleasure many times\nto visit his family.  His mother is deceased. However, his father and step-mother are citizens and\n\nItem 7 (Interrogatories, dated September 28, 2006).\n5\nConsular Information Sheet - Libya, united States Department of State, dated July 27, 2006 at 2.\n6\nCountry reports on Human Rights Practices 2005 - Libya, United States Department of State, dated march 8,\n7\n2006.\nBackground Note: Tunisia, United States Department of State, dated October 2006 at 6.\n8\nId. at 3-6.\n9\n4\nresidents of Libya. He has seven brothers who are citizens and residents of Libya. His father-in-law\nand mother-in-law live in Tunisia. Applicant maintains weekly contact with his in-laws. Other than\naddresses and dates of birth of his family members, as noted on his security clearance application\n(SF 86), Applicant has provided no information regarding his family. Other than admitting to their\nexistence, Applicant failed to provide any pertinent facts in response to the SOR.5\nThe government submitted information regarding Libya and Tunisia. It notes that the U.S.\nwithdrew from diplomatic relations with Libya in 1973 to protest its support for revolutionary and\nterror groups. Although the Libyan Government's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism was\nrescinded on June 30, 2006, recent worldwide terrorist alerts have stated that extremists groups\ncontinue to plan terrorists attacks against U.S. interests in that region.6\nThe country maintains an extensive security apparatus that includes police and military units,\nmultiple intelligence services, local Revolutionary committees and \"Purification\" committees.\nSecurity forces have the authority to impose sentences without trial, and the various Security forces\ncommitted numerous, serious human rights abuses.  \n7\nTunisia  has sought to maintain good relations with the West, while playing an active role\nin Arab and African regional bodies.  Tunisian-U.S. relations suffered briefly in 1985 after the Israeli\n8\nraid on the Tunis PLO headquarters, in 1988 after the Tunisian assassination of a PLO terrorist , and\nagain in 1990 during the Gulf War. Tunisia has an active schedule of joint military exercises with\nthe U.S. The Department of State, however, warns that in late 2002 and early 2003 tourists were\nkidnapped in the Sahara desert areas of southeastern Algeria, and although American citizens have\nnot bee n attacked, Al-Queda terrorists attacked a synagogue and many Western tourists were killed.9\nIn assessing the vulnerability to exploitation of Applicant's family, it is helpful to consider\nseveral factors. Even friendly nations can have profound disagreement with the U.S. over matters\nthey view as important to their vital interests or national security. We know friendly nations have\nengaged in espionage against the U.S., especially in the economic, scientific, and technical field. See\nISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). The nature of a nation's  government, its\nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights records are all relevant in assessing the likelihood\nthat an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\n\nThe Directive, as amended by Change 4, dated April 20, 1999, uses 'clearly consistent with the national\n10\ninterest\" (Sec. 2.3; Sec.2.5.3; Sec 3.2.; and Sec. 4.2.; Enclosure 3, Sec. E3.1.1.; Sec. E3.1.2.; Sec. E3.1.2.5.; Sec.\nE3.1.2.6.; and Sec. E3.1.2.7.), \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.3.); and\n\"clearly consistent with national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.2.).\n5\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access\nto classified information (Mitigating Conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules\nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied\nin conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section\nE2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair\nand impartial commonsense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\"whole person concept,\" all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The Adjudicative\nProcess factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals's  age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under\nthis Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited, to such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \"clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security\" or \"clearly consistent with the national interest.\"10\nFor the purposes herein, despite the different wording in each, I have concluded all of the standards\nare the same. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n11\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Para E3.1.15.\n12\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Para. E2.2.2\n13\n6\nIn the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the\ngovernment to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the\n11\napplicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\novercome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance.12\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. Because of this special relationship, the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nor safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Any\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved\nin favor of national security.13\nOne additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are\nnot at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that\nindustrial security clearance decisions shall be, \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Security clearance decisions cover\nmany characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this\ndecision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express\nor implied decision as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in\nthe SOR. \nForeign Influence\nThe government established its case under Guideline B. Applicant admits that his father, step-\nmother, seven brothers, and in-laws are residents and citizens of Libya and Tunisia. The foreign\ncitizenship and residency of these individuals raise a security concern, under Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Condition (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7 (a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or\n\n7\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion).\nApplicant admits traveling on many short trips for business and for family pleasure. He did\nnot elaborate on the extent or nature of the visits. This raises FI DC AG \u00b6 7 (i) (conduct, especially\nwhile traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure,\nor coercion by a foreign person, group, government or country).\nWhen the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the\nburden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. Here Applicant offered no such\ninformation. Furthermore, the FORM does not include any facts that might provide an argument for\nApplicant; it only contains references to these individuals in the Applicant's SF-86, the SOR, and the\nreply to the SOR. Without more, a determination cannot be made under Foreign Influence Mitigating\nCondition (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8 (a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich the persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) .\nConsequently, that mitigating condition cannot be applied. \nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his children are U.S. citizens. However, he is in\na position of vulnerability - he could be placed in the vulnerable position of having to choose between\nhis loyalty to the U.S. and his loyalty to members of his family in Libya. Applicant insists he will\nreport any foreign contacts and that he is not vulnerable to foreign coercion or influence, but there is\ninsufficient evidence to support the application of FI MC AG \u00b6 8 (b) (there is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group or\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest).\nApplicant admitted that he has taken many short trips for business out of the country to the\nUnited Kingdom. He visited his family from 1995 until the recent present many times. He also\nacknowledged his weekly contacts with family members, demonstrating familial ties. Thus, FI MC\nAG \u00b6 8 (c) ( contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is\nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation) does not apply.\nThere is nothing in the record to support the other mitigating conditions such as authorized\ncontact by the U.S. government,  reporting any contacts with persons or organizations from a foreign\ncountry, or financial or property interests that are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nWhole Person \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\n\n8\nduties. As noted above, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the whole person concept. It recognizes a person be viewed by the totality of his or her\nacts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nI considered both the record evidence and Applicant in light of the whole-person concept.\nI have also considered the countries at issue, Libya and Tunisia. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated professional who has worked for a defense contractor for many years. A naturalized U.S.\ncitizen, his immediately family remains citizens and residents of Libya and Tunisia. Such facts are\nnot necessarily dispositive. Applicant failed, however to provide any facts upon which an assessment\ncan be made as to whether they might be used as instruments or victims of state coercion. Because\nany doubts must be resolved in favor or national security, I find the allegations regarding foreign\ninfluence in the government's favor. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n              Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:           \n AgainstApplicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

There is little to no chance she will be in a position to address this debt anytime soon.\n\n2\nClearance is denied.\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing. The case was assigned to the undersigned on\nNovember 14, 2006. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 27, 2006, and the hearing was\nheld on December 28, 2006. The transcript was received on January 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 49 years of age. She has been employed by the same defense contractor since\nApril 2005.\nSOR Allegation 1a: In 2003, applicant had a car repossessed because of an unpaid balance\nof more than $10,000.00.\nSOR Allegation 1b: As of August 2005, applicant was delinquent on a Capital One credit\ncard account in the approximate amount of $500.00.\nSOR Allegation 1c: As of August 2005, applicant was delinquent on a Citibank Visa credit\ncard account in the approximate amount of $3,800.00.\nSOR Allegation 1d: As of August 2005, applicant was delinquent on an Emerge Providian\ncredit card debt in the approximate amount of $500.00.\nSOR Allegation 1e: On March 1, 2006, applicant provided DoD with a Personal Financial\nStatement which showed a monthly deficit of $383.91.\nSOR Allegation 1f:  In her response to the SOR, applicant denied this allegation. At the\nhearing she testified she denied it because the debt arose from a credit card that was in her husband\u2019s\nname (TR at 15-16).\nSOR Allegation 1g: Applicant is indebted to MBNA America in the approximate amount\nof $3,000.00. This debt went delinquent and was charged off.\nSOR Allegation 1h: Applicant is indebted to NCO Financial in the approximate amount of\n$7,125.00. This account went delinquent and was referred for collection.\n\n3\nSOR Allegation 1i: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the past-due amount of at least\n$2,000.00 (TR at 23-25).\nSOR Allegation 1j: Applicant was indebted to American General Financial Services in the\napproximate amount of $2,446.00. This debt was secured by applicant\u2019s truck, which has since been\nturned over to the creditor. It is unclear at this time if applicant\u2019s truck was sufficient to cover the\ndebt.\nSOR Allegation 1k: As of July 2006, applicant and her husband had unpaid dental and\nmedical bills totaling approximately $13,000.00.\nApplicant testified that her financial problems began in the summer of 2002 when she and\nher husband both experienced severe medical problems. First, it was discovered that her husband had\na blockage in his carotid artery and needed surgery to correct the problem. While he was in intensive\ncare recovering from the surgery, applicant suffered a severe heart attack, which resulted in her\nundergoing heart bypass surgery three days later.\nAlthough applicant and her husband eventually returned to work, they were never able to earn\nenough money to repay their past-due debts. There were two main reasons for this. First, because her\nhusband worked in the construction business, his paychecks were never reliable. Second, in March\n2004, applicant decided to accept what she thought would be a better position in a different city.  The\nposition never worked out, and applicant went through at least two periods of unemployment before\nshe started working at her present job in April 2005.\nAs if they had not gone through enough, at the beginning of this year, applicant\u2019s husband\nunderwent back surgery. The surgery did not go well, and he has been disabled and unable to work\nsince then.\nFor the past four months, applicant and her husband have been living with two of their\nfriends. The friends have allowed them to live rent free, and have paid for all food and utilities.\nApplicant and the friends have agreed that applicant and her husband should be able to move out by\nJune 2007. Because she needs to save up enough money to be able to rent an apartment, applicant\nhas not made any payments on any of the past-due debts even though she has saved approximately\n$1,500.00 since living with the friends.  She has not contacted any of the creditors listed in the SOR\nbecause she is not in a position to do anything about her debts and doesn\u2019t want to make promises\nshe can\u2019t keep. She testified credibly that she intends to satisfy these past-due debts when she is able\nto do so. She is hoping that her husband will be able to go back to work, or at least start collecting\ndisability benefits, in the near future.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that (1) applicant has been experiencing significant financial\ndifficulties since 2002, (2) she is still indebted to numerous creditors for past-due debts in the\napproximate total amount of $30,000.00,  and (3) there is little to no chance she will be in a position\nto satisfy these past-due debts anytime soon. Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not\n\n4\nmeeting financial obligations) and E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) are\napplicable.\nApplicant offered overwhelming evidence that her financial problems were caused by\nmedical problems that were obviously beyond her control. Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.3 (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation) is therefore applicable.\nAt the present time, applicant is clearly experiencing significant financial difficulties.\nAlthough these financial difficulties were clearly caused by factors beyond her control, the fact\nremains her present situation fits squarely within the Financial Guideline Concern expressed in the\nDirective (E2.A6.1.1.1 - An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.). Because there is little to no chance these financial problems will\nbe resolved anytime soon, I have no choice but to conclude it is not now clearly consistent with the\nnational interest for applicant to have access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 31, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn November 29, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Guideline H disqualifying and mitigating conditions was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant is 23 years old.  He used marijuana five times between July 2005 and December\n2006\u2013four times during college and once after he began working.  After his last usage, Applicant\nrealized that his decision to use drugs was a bad one, and he resolved never to use illegal drugs\nagain.  Applicant was honest about his drug usage on his security clearance application and in his\ninterview with an investigator.  Applicant is pursuing a master\u2019s degree and is highly thought of by\nhis employer. \nThe Judge concluded that \u201c[t]he government failed to establish a case for disqualification\nunder Guideline H.\u201d  Department Counsel argues that conclusion is in error.  Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument has merit.  Applicant admitted his drug abuse, and the Directive states that \u201cany drug\nabuse\u201d is sufficient to raise a security concern.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.25(a).  Thus, the government\u2019s\nsecurity concern against him was established.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-22515 at 2 (App. Bd.\nDec. 7, 2007).  The burden then shifted to Applicant to provide evidence of mitigation.\nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating conditions is\nin error.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention in this regard lacks merit. The Judge reasonably\nexplained why  he applied Guideline H mitigating conditions \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b).   The Judge based\n1\nhis conclusions on record evidence such as the infrequency and the circumstances of the drug use.\nThe Judge also considered changes in Applicant\u2019s life, including his career and his pursuit of a\nmaster\u2019s degree.\nWhile the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the government did not establish a case against Applicant\nwas error, that error is harmless, because the Judge went on to apply mitigating factors in order to\n\nThe Board also need not agree with the Judge\u2019s characterizations, e.g., \u201cdenying a clearance for a 23-year-old\n2\nwho used marijuana five times defies common sense.\u201d \n3\nmitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s drug use.

Clearance granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 31 August 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of illegal\ndrug use.  He answered the SOR 17 September 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the\n1\n\n2\ncase to me 10 October 2007, and I convened a hearing 14 November 2007. DOHA received the\ntranscript 21 November 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant\u2014a 23-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor since June\n2006\u2014seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.\nApplicant has used marijuana five times between July 2005 and December 2006: thrice with\ncollege friends between July and August 2005, once with these same friends in April 2006 to\ncelebrate graduating from college and getting a job, and once in December 2006 while home visiting\none of these friends. Each of these uses occurred in social settings, usually in someone\u2019s home. The\nApril 2006 incident occurred in the woods. Marijuana was always offered to him. He never\npurchased or sold it. After his last marijuana use in December 2006, Applicant realized he made a\nbad decision using marijuana, and felt guilty about his use. He realized he had a lot to lose by\ncontinuing to use, and resolved to cease.\nApplicant was offered a job by his current employer in December 2005, and he accepted. He\napplied for a security clearance in March 2006 (G.E. 1), having executed the signature page and\nreleases in February 2006, before graduating from college. He fully disclosed his marijuana use in\nJuly and August 2005. He was hired by his current employer, in another state from where he went\nto college, into a professional development program in June 2006. He performed so well in this\nprogram that his supervisor recommended him for a permanent position, which was subsequently\noffered, and accepted by Applicant in September 2007 (A.E. A). His supervisor finds him honest,\ncourteous, and forthright. He has received excellent performance ratings (A.E. B). He is currently\npursuing his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, and has achieved high marks in his courses\n(A.E. C). In October 2007, he obtained at his own expense, and passed, a drug screen for the normal\nrange of illegal drugs, including marijuana (A.E. D).\nApplicant was interviewed as part of his background investigation in May 2007. He discussed\nthe details of his July-August 2005 marijuana usage, disclosed without prompting his April and\nDecember 2006 marijuana usage, and stated his intent to remain drug-free (G.E. 2).\nApplicant testified at hearing. I found his testimony credible, and I believe it. He described\nhow stupid he felt in December 2006, when he realized what he was risking by continuing his\nmarijuana use. He reiterated his intent to abstain from marijuana use in the future. \nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nAny drug abuse [\u00a7 25.(a)];\n3\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely\n4\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment [\u00b6\n26.(a)][Emphasis supplied];\nA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: . . . (2) changing or avoiding the\n5\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; . . . [\u00b6  26.(b)].\n3\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline H (Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline H. While the\ngovernment established that Applicant used marijuana five times between July 2005 and December\n2006,  this level of drug abuse is insufficient to be disqualifying or raise a significant security\n3\nconcern. Further, even if I gave the government the benefit of the doubt on the disqualifying\ncondition, Applicant mitigates the security concerns, by demonstrating that the use was infrequent\nand under circumstances unlikely to recur,  and further demonstrating intent to not abuse drugs in\n4\nthe future.  His marijuana use was confined to his college friends in his home town. It was casual\n5\nand infrequent. Although he last used marijuana while home on vacation, six months after starting\nhis job, he quickly realized that marijuana use was inconsistent with his professional career, and\nknew it was time to put away childish things. While Applicant\u2019s use is fairly characterized as\n\u201crecent,\u201d this term has less meaning under the new adjudicative criteria, where the corresponding\nlanguage \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago. . .\u201d [\u00b6 26.(a)], is used in the disjunctive with language\n\n4\nthat clearly applies to Applicant. Further, while his abstention from marijuana use since December\n2006 might not necessarily constitute an appropriate period of abstinence, given the minimal\nmarijuana use by Applicant and his change in environment\u2014both physical (new state) and\npsychological (career versus school)\u2014I conclude that this abstinence is appropriate [\u00b6 26.(b)]. On\nthis record, it is extremely unlikely that Applicant would return to illegal drug use. Further, denying\na clearance for a 23-year-old who used marijuana five times defies common sense. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline H for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On September 26, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 27, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant alleges that the Judge erred by not applying Guideline B Mitigating Condition 8(b)\nin Applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29,\n43(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance a security clearance.  See,\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9 Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After\nthe government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nestablish any appropriate mitigating conditions. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201cThe application of\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 05-\n03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nIn this case, the Judge wrote that Applicant has not demonstrated a \u201csufficient relationship\nand loyalty to the United States that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S.\u201d  In challenging that conclusion, Applicant relies on her (and her husband\u2019s) acquisition\nof U.S. citizenship in response to the events in Tianamen Square.\nThe Judge\u2019s conclusion is sustainable for three reasons: \nThe Judge found that China has an authoritarian regime, with a poor human rights record and\npractices arbitrary arrest and prisoner mistreatment.  He also found that China aggressively competes\nwith the United States and actively collects military, economic, proprietary and industrial\ninformation about the U.S.  Given those findings there is a plausible concern that the presence of\nApplicant\u2019s family members in China could present a security concern.\nApplicant\u2019s sense of obligation to her parents in China is substantiated without need to\nconsider rebuttable presumptions.  The Judge found that Applicant sends her parents $1000 to $2000\na year.  Applicant\u2019s husband sends his mother in China comparable amounts.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s unhappiness with China\u2019s conduct in the Tianamen Square events is not\nnecessarily synonymous with ties to the United States.  Nor is it indicative of a history of compliance\nwith security procedures and regulations in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in\nwhich the applicant had made a significant contribution to national security.  Cf.  ISCR Case No. 04-\n02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007).\nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis on analogous grounds.  The\nreasoning above applies to that challenge.\n \nThus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance. \nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Her husband, who also emigrated from China to the United States maintains a similar\nrelationship with his parents, who are also citizen residents of China. Applicant did not mitigate\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 27, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nSeptember 26, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer notarized on October 20, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations,\nand elected to have her case decided at a hearing.  On January 3, 2007, the case was assigned to me.\n3\nHer hearing was held on January 31, 2007.

Immigration and Naturalization\nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative\nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from\ngovernment reports.

China is geographically vast, and has\na population of over one billion people. It has significant resources, and an economy\nthat in recent years has expanded about 10% per year. China aggressively competes with\nthe United States in many areas. China\u2019s competitive relationship with the United States\nexacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s Chinese connections.  \nChina actively collects military, economic and proprietary, and industrial\ninformation about the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its\nposition as a global superpower; (2) its military, political, and economic investments\nin the Pacific Rim and Asia; (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology\nthat China desires for economic growth; and (4) China considers the large number of\nAmericans of Chinese ancestry as intelligence targets.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable m ind  m ight accept as\n7\nadequate to support a c o nclusion in light of all the contrary record.\u201d  ISCR Case N o. 04-11463 at 2\n(App. B d.

ISC R Case N o. 04-10340 at 2 (App. B d. July 6, 2006).\u201d \n6\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nGuideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the\nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial\nevidence.\u201d  The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish\n7\na case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to\nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving\na mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at\n5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8\n\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail\na certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual,\nrisk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Section 7 of Executive\nOrder 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial security clearance decision\nshall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to\nthe loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  An adverse determination is not a finding that\nan applicant is disloyal to the United States, but merely that he or she has not met the\nstringent standards, established by the President, to be eligible for access to classified\ninformation. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and\ninterests\u201d stating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests,\n[he or she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,\nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the\nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information\nand/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying in this case, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\n\n8\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons; regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is\nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative\nlives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor\nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially\nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5\n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nApplicant has relatively frequent and regular contact with her parents as does\nher husband with his parents.  These contacts, whether out of affection or obligation\nwith her immediate family members, create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or\nattempted exploitation. Her relationship with these immediate family members also\ncreates a potential conflict of interest because it is sufficiently close to raise a security\nconcern about her desire to help her parents and brothers by providing sensitive or\nclassified information. \nApplicant admitted and the Government produced substantial evidence of these\nthree disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove mitigation. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating\ncondition never shifts to the Government.\nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are\npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation;\nGuideline \u00b6 8(a) does not apply to her relationships with her parents. Her\ncontacts with these immediate family members are not casual and infrequent. If she\ndoes not contact these family members out of affection, she certainly does so\n\n9ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant could be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between her parents and the interests of the United States.\nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) does not apply because Appellant has not demonstrated, in the\nevidence she presented, a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S. that she can\nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Although\nshe lived in the United States since 1989, and became a U.S. citizen in 1999, she has\nnot demonstrated that she has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S. such that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest. The facts presented by Applicant are insufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns as discussed in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, infra.  \nGuideline \u00b6 8(c) does not apply because of the regularity and consistency of her\ncontact with immediate family members in China.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as\ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to\nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept,\nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life\nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are\n9\nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve\nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the\neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.  In addition to the\n10\neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense\ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \nThe Appeal Board has held that the whole person analysis can properly factor in\n\u201c[o]ther matters such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and\nextent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign\n\nSee ISCR Case N o. 04-06242 at 2 (App. B d. June 28, 2006). \n11\n10\ncountry; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a\ngiven case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards granting Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for 18 years, and she has been a\nnaturalized citizen for eight years. When she became a U.S. citizen, she swore\nallegiance to the United States. Her husband is also a naturalized U.S. citizen and her\nson is a U.S.-born citizen. There is no evidence she has ever taken any action which\ncould cause potential harm to the United States. Applicant does appear to take her\nloyalty to the United States very seriously, and she has worked diligently for a defense\ncontractor for two years.  \nFive circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First,\nChina is a nuclear power and China\u2019s government is a rival of the United States. China\nis an authoritarian, Communist state. More importantly for security purposes, China\nactively seeks classified and industrial/economic information. China may attempt to use\nher parents and in-laws who live in China to obtain such information. Second, she had\nsignificant connections to China before she emigrated to the United States in 1989. She\nwas born in China, and spent her formative years there. Third, her parents and in-laws\nare citizen residents of China. Her contacts with her parents as well as her husband\u2019s\ncontacts with his parents demonstrate a sense of loyalty and obligation to them which\ncontinues. Fourth, she visited China one time in 1991 for approximately two weeks to\nsee her family since she arrived in the U.S. Her father has visited Applicant and her\nfamily in the U.S. two times in 1994 and 1998 and stayed approximately one year for\neach visit. Individually, these contacts may appear minimal, but collectively they\ndemonstrate a sense of obligation and a connection with family members in China. Fifth,\nother than her husband, she has no other known immediate family members or other\npersons with whom she maintains a close relationship living in the U.S.  \nApplicant successfully refuted the allegation alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. as factually incorrect.  The\ngovernment did not present any evidence in rebuttal.\n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it\nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by\ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir.\nth\n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence. This is a close case, but\nultimately the evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and\nsuitability.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and\n11\nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has\n\n11\nnot mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she\nis not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n Paragraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts for about $13,769 in total. Based on his July response to the SOR, Applicant admits indebtedness of about $8,245 and denies the balance. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant made false statements when providing answers to four questions on his security-clearance application. His position on these allegations will be discussed below. In addition, the following facts are established. Applicant is a 35-year-old assistant steward who has worked for a shipping company since November 2004. This is an entry-level position, and his goal is to make a career out of it by working his way up the ladder in the steward department. He married in 2002, and he and his wife had a son in 2004. His wife is 23 years old and she is not employed outside the home. This is the first time Applicant has applied for a security clearance, and he completed a security-clearance application in December 2004 (Exhibit 1). When signing his application, he certified that his statements were true, complete, and correct to the best on his knowledge and belief and were made in good faith, and he acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under federal law. Applicant submitted a \u201cclean\u201d application; in other words, he did not 3 disclose any background information that was negative or derogatory.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems, which is ongoing. He has done little\nto demonstrate that he will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. In addition, he\nmade multiple false statements about his background on a security-clearance application. Clearance\nis denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on May 7, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations based on delinquent debts and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification\nof a security-clearance application.   \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn June 25, 2007, and then again on July 21, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and\nrequested a hearing. The hearing took place as scheduled on October 16, 2007, and the transcript was\nreceived on October 24, 2007.     \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts for about $13,769 in total. Based\non his July response to the SOR, Applicant admits indebtedness of about $8,245 and denies the\nbalance. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant made false statements when providing\nanswers to four questions on his security-clearance application. His position on these allegations will\nbe discussed below. In addition, the following facts are established.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old assistant steward who has worked for a shipping company since\nNovember 2004. This is an entry-level position, and his goal is to make a career out of it by working\nhis way up the ladder in the steward department. He married in 2002, and he and his wife had a son\nin 2004. His wife is 23 years old and she is not employed outside the home. \nThis is the first time Applicant has applied for a security clearance, and he completed a\nsecurity-clearance application in December 2004 (Exhibit 1). When signing his application, he\ncertified that his statements were true, complete, and correct to the best on his knowledge and belief\nand were made in good faith, and he acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could\nbe punished under federal law. Applicant submitted a \u201cclean\u201d application; in other words, he did not\n\n3\ndisclose any background information that was negative or derogatory. In particular, he answered the\nfollowing questions in the negative:\n\u2022\nQuestion 24\u2013asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any drug- or alcohol-\nrelated offenses.\n\u2022\nQuestion 27\u2013asking if he had, in the last seven years, illegally used any controlled substance,\nto include marijuana.\n\u2022\nQuestion 38\u2013asking if in the last seven years he had been over 180-days delinquent on any\ndebts.\n\u2022\nQuestion 39\u2013asking if he was currently over 90-days delinquent on any debts.\nThe background investigation of Applicant revealed the following: (1) a 1999 arrest for\npossession of marijuana resulting in Applicant pleading no contest (Exhibit 8); (2) a history of\nmarijuana use by Applicant from at least 1997 to about June 2001; and (3) credit reports containing\nnumerous and longstanding delinquent debts (Exhibits 5, 6, and 7). He did not disclose any of this\ninformation on his security-clearance application as required by the scope of Questions 24, 27, 38,\nand 39. \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems as established by credit reports from\n2005, 2006, and 2007 (Exhibits 5, 6, and 7). The credit reports form the basis for the debts in the\nSOR. He denied 4 of the 14 debts. In particular, he denied the indebtedness in SOR \u00b6 1.e, because\nof a dispute over merchandise he purchased. He denied the indebtedness in SOR \u00b6 1.h,  because he\nwas not familiar with the creditor. He denied the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l, because he\nhad no idea about the medical bills. And he denied, in part, the indebtedness in SOR \u00b6 1.n, because\nhe disputes the amount the creditor is seeking to collect on a judgment based on a delinquent credit\ncard account. Applicant did not provide any documentary information to support his denials. \nConcerning the debts he admits, Applicant has been unable to repay or otherwise resolve the\nindebtedness. In his testimony, he stressed that he needs to be able to work to pay his debts and his\ncurrent position provides him a better opportunity to do so. He met with a consumer credit\ncounseling organization in 2005 or 2006, but was unable to undertake a repayment plan due to lack\nof money. The soonest Applicant believes he will be able to begin to repay these debts is in March\n2008, when he completes repaying a motorcycle loan (his transportation) and a family loan.\nApplicant did not provide any documentary information about these debts or about his overall\nfinancial situation. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n15\n DC 1 is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n16\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\n5\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and credible adverse\n14\ninformation that may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. In particular, a\nsecurity concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d15\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made false statements when providing answers to four\nquestions on his security-clearance application. In general, Applicant contends his statements were\nnot deliberately false. For Question 24 about arrests, he thought the question had a five-year scope.\nFor Question 27 about drug use, he considered it \u201ca mandatory no\u201d question if he wanted to get and\nkeep the job, and he knew that his answer was false (R. 52, 63\u201365). For Questions 38 and 39 about\ndelinquent debts, he knew he had debts, but did not think they were delinquent. The issue is whether\nApplicant\u2019s answers to these four questions were deliberately false. Given the record evidence, the\nmultiple allegations will be treated collectively instead of analyzing each falsification allegation\nindividually. \nThe doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus (false in one thing, false in everything)\nshould be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility. In his hearing testimony, Applicant\nessentially admitted that his answer to Question 27 was deliberately false when he described it as \u201ca\nmandatory no\u201d question (R. 52, 63\u201365). In addition, he seemed to concede some untruthfulness in\nhis closing argument (R. 79). Taken together, these circumstances show his denial to Question 27\nwas deliberately false. Because his answer to Question 27 is so obviously false, his attempts to refute\nand rebut the other three falsification allegations are not persuasive. In short, Applicant\u2019s testimony\non these points has no credibility. On this basis, the record evidence is sufficient to prove Applicant\nmade deliberately false statements as alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, the record evidence is\nsufficient to conclude that DC 1  applies against Applicant. \n16\n\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n17\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n18\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n19\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n20\n6\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. His deliberately false answers and explanations militate against credit in\nextenuation or mitigation.\n2.\nThe Financial Considerations Security Concern\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n17\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n18\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nIn this regard, his denials of four debt allegations are not accepted as valid explanations given that\nhe did not provide corroborating evidence (documentary information) to support his denials. His\nhistory of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability to satisfy debts  and\n19\na history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record\n20\nevidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none apply in\nhis favor. His financial problems are longstanding and cannot be traced solely to an unexpected event\nor circumstance beyond his control. In addition, he presented little in the way of favorable\ninformation (including no documentary information), and his good intentions and future plans are\nnot sufficient evidence to overcome the security concern raised by the government\u2019s evidence.\nIndeed, what is missing here is: (1) a realistic approach for resolving his delinquent debts; (2)\ndocumented actions taken in furtherance of that approach; and (3) a measurable improvement to his\nsituation. At this point, it is likely that his history of financial problems will continue. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due\nconsideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision for Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraphs a\u2013n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

The SOR detailed reasons why the \nGovernment could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.1  \nThe SOR alleges specific concerns over alcohol (Guideline G), criminal conduct \n(Guideline J) and personal conduct (Guideline E) based on the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of \nDefense, effective September 1, 2006.   Applicant received the SOR on June 22, 2007. \nHe responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer dated July 5, 2007, where he \nadmitted all the allegations and requested a hearing for which he retained counsel.   \n \n \n     1  This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.    \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nAfter Department Counsel indicated the case was ready to proceed on August 6, \n2007, the matter was assigned to me on August 9, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually \nconvenient date for hearing was agreed to.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on August 16, \n2007, set the matter for September 25, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works \nand lives. \n \n \nAt the hearing the Government offered five exhibits (Exhibit 1-5) admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s counsel offered one exhibit, Exhibit A, admitted without objection, \nand called four witnesses including Applicant.  The transcript (TR) was received on \nOctober 3, 2007. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \n   \n \nApplicant, 28 years old, has been employed as a computer operator and \ntelecommunications mechanic by a defense contractor #1 in State #1 from December \n2001 to August 2007.  He now lives in State #2 and has worked for defense contractor \n#2 from August 2007 to present.   He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF-\n86) which he signed on February 20, 2004.  He previously was granted a Top Secret \nclearance in February 1998 when he served in the military from July 1997 to November \n2001.  (Exhibits 1, 2, 5; TR 19-20; 26; 29; 51)  \n \n \nApplicant has never married, but is engaged.  (Exhibit 1, TR 28-29) \n \nAlcohol, Criminal Conduct, Personal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his non-judicial punishment while in the military in \nresponse to Question 25 on his SF 86.  In his investigative interview in March 2006, he \nvoluntarily disclosed he went to Captain\u2019s Mast three times.  (Exhibits 1, 5; Answer)  \nWhile serving in the military, he received Non-Judicial Punishment under the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) in February 1999 for Wrongful Possession/Use of False \nMilitary ID after he obtained a false ID show a birth year of 1976 instead of the correct \ndate of1979 in order to enter clubs and be served alcohol while under the legal age \nlimit.  He forfeited $250 and was restricted for 15 days.  However, he was not reduced \nin rank.  (SOR 1.d.; 3.a.(1)) He also received non-judicial punishment in 1999 for \nviewing pornographic material on a government computer and was restricted for 15 \ndays.  (SOR 1.d.; 3.a.(2))  In September 1999 he had non-judicial punishment imposed \nfor Failure to Obey Regulations and forfeited $500.  (Answer; Exhibit 2)  Because of this \nvoluntary disclosure to the investigator, he established that he had no intent to falsify by \nthese omissions.  Instead, he misinterpreted the questions as he read them too quickly.  \n(SOR 3.a.(1), (2), (3))  (Exhibits 1,2, Answer; TR 25-26; 44-46)   \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAfter he served in the military from July 1997 to November 2001, Applicant was \ngranted an honorable discharge.  He received two \u201cE\u201d ribbons, an expeditionary medal, \ntwo Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, an Armed Forces Service Medal, two Sea \nService Deployment ribbons, and an enlisted surface warfare pin.  There was no \nadverse information recorded on his Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active \nDuty.  (Exhibits 1, 5) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of \nintoxication from 1993 to at least March 2006.  (SOR 1.a.)  However, he never drank in \nthe mornings or during working hours.  (Answer; TR 21; TR 29-31)   \n \n \nIn response to Question 23 Applicant did not list a February 2004 arrest on his \nSF-86 since he had not been convicted at the time he completed his security papers in \nFebruary 2004.  However, he did advise his supervisor of the arrest.  He volunteered \nthis information in the investigative interview and explained he had no intent to falsify his \nSF-86 and misinterpreted the question.  (SOR 3.a.) (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 24; 41-44) \n \n \n \nIn a March 2006 investigative interview Applicant admitted he continued to \nconsume alcohol once or twice per week.  Then he was having four mixed drinks when \nhe drank.  He admitted becoming intoxicated once per month after drinking seven mixed \ndrinks.  He did not drink during his group sessions with an Alcohol Safety Action \nProgram (ASAP) counselor (Dr. B.) in 2004.  At that time he attended AA beyond what \nwas required and had an AA sponsor.  Recently, in 2007 he made a decision to stop \ndrinking; however, he does not attend AA.  His girlfriend who does not drink is his \n\u201csponsor.\u201d  The only exception to his 2007 resolution for abstinence was that he had two \ndrinks for his birthday in September 2007.  Prior to that, his last drink was for New \nYears 2007.  In those two cases he did not drive after he had these drinks.  He no \nlonger has any compulsion to drink.  (Exhibit 2; TR 21-22; 34-38; 48-49)   \n \n \nApplicant no longer associates with people who drink.  (TR 23)  He has matured \nand been helped by his counseling with the ASAP counselor (Dr.B).  (TR 27)  Applicant \nis now able to better manage his relationships since he stopped drinking.  (TR 28) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in August 2001 in State #1 and charged and found guilty \nwith Driving Under the Influence (DUI), sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended, and \nordered to attend alcohol education classes.  (SOR 1.b.) (Answer; TR 21)  At that time \nApplicant was in the military and attended an ASAP program of alcohol education \nclasses which he successfully completed.  He paid all fines and met all court \nrequirements.  He was not evaluated for alcohol abuse in the military.  Everyone in the \nmilitary was required to go through alcohol and substance abuse programs.  (Exhibit 2; \nTR 36-37) \n \n \nApplicant was again arrested in February 2004 in State #1 and charged and \npleaded guilty to Driving Under the Influence, 2nd Offense, and Speeding.  He was fined, \nsentenced to 12 months in jail, 11 months, suspended, and ordered to attend alcohol \n\n \n4 \n \n \neducation classes (ASAP). His driver\u2019s license was suspended for three years.(SOR \n1.c.)  He served one month in jail on weekends.  When he reported to ASAP he was \nreferred to Dr. B and attended fourteen sessions and successfully completed the \nprogram.  He also attended the required four Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and \nvoluntarily went to eight more AA meetings.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 3; TR 21; TR 39-41)   \n \n \nApplicant was never diagnosed as being an alcoholic or having alcohol \ndependency, but was diagnosed as an abuser of alcohol in 2005. (TR 33-34)  Dr. B \nrecommended he abstain from alcohol.  Finally, in 2007 Applicant did abstain except for \nhis birthday in September 2007 when he had two drinks.  (TR 34-35) \n \n \nFrom August to November 2005 Applicant worked overseas to support a military \ncontract.  When he returned, he drove his car from his friend\u2019s home to his home even \nthough his license was suspended and while he was restricted to driving to and from \nwork.  He was stopped in November 2005 for having an expired inspection because he \nhad been overseas on a work assignment and had not noticed his expired sticker.  He \npleaded guilty to driving on a suspended license in April 2006, a misdemeanor, and was \nfined $600 which he paid.  (Exhibit 4; TR 23-24; 46) \n \n \nThe ASAP counselor (Dr. B) testified that his credentials include a Ph.D. in \ncriminal justice and marriage and family therapy and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology.  He \nis licensed as a professional counselor and as a family therapist.   He is a substance \nabuse professional as well and runs a program to help individuals with substance abuse \nissues.  He works on the AA model and requires individuals to attend AA weekly while \nin treatment.  He was accepted as an expert in substance abuse.  (TR 65-70)  Dr B \ntestified that Applicant was in treatment with him for four months from November 2004 \nto April 2005 when he completed the program.  He assessed Applicant as \u201can excellent \nparticipant.\u201d  His organization fully cooperated in allowing Applicant the time to attend \nthe program.  Dr B assessed Applicant as being very dedicated and committed to the \ntreatment program.  Part of his program is having individuals assess what are the \ntriggers that caused them to drink in order to avoid relapse.  In the subsequent two \nyears Applicant has called Dr. B to discuss issues; Dr. B was impressed that Applicant \nhad not relapsed even in \u201cvery low times.\u201d  He has had no other DUI incidents.  Dr. B \nencouraged people to be realistic in their relapse program and be realistic and to set \nlimits.  When they drink, he recommended they be cautious and not drive.  He \nconcluded Applicant had been successful in his approach.  In conversations with Dr. B \nsubsequent to completing the program, Applicant explained that if he would have a \ndrink he would not drive.  (TR 70-77)  On cross-examination, Dr. B stated he had \ndiagnosed Applicant as an alcohol abuser, not alcohol dependent.  While he preferred \nabstinence, he encouraged people to only drink in moderation.  His preference would be \nfor one drink. He would be concerned about three drinks, but not overly concerned.  He \nconsidered taking two drinks a \u201cslippery slope\u201d that could indicate potential for relapse \nfor alcoholics or for alcohol abusers.  He recommends ongoing involvement in AA. (TR \n77-88) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant successfully completed the ASAP program in July 2007.  He is no \nlonger on probation and his driving restrictions have been lifted.  (Exhibit A; TR 46-47) \n \n \nReferences \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s site manager from Defense Contractor #1 knew him during the six \nyears he worked for the organization.  He assessed Applicant as a very good, very \nreliable and hard-working employee. He learned his position well and the organization \nrelied on him to get the job done.  He assessed Applicant as being in the top category of \nworkers.  Applicant for a time was a shift supervisor.  He was aware of the 2004 DUI but \nthat arrest did not cause him any concern.  He observed that Applicant came to work on \ntime and never demonstrated any behavior that would indicate an alcohol or other \nproblem.  He found Applicant to be completely honest.  If Applicant wished to return to \nthe company, the site manager would recommend that he be rehired immediately.  He \ndid not formally evaluate Applicant as he was a union employee and nothing in the \ncollective bargain agreement covered evaluation.  (TR 51-52; 53-55) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor at the facility testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  His \nsupervisor previously knew Applicant when they served in the military together for two \nand a half years.  He hired Applicant and assessed Applicant as being a \u201cgreat worker.\u201d  \nHe did an outstanding job in his first assignment and then did an excellent job in the \nsecond position.  He was his supervisor\u2019s \u201cright-hand man.\u201d  The supervisor knew about \nApplicant\u2019s 2004 DUI, but he never saw alcohol affect his performance.  He was on call \n\u201c24/7\u201d and was always reliable.  He noted that Applicant was 100% committed to his \njob.  He viewed Applicant as very honest.  He would rehire Applicant.(TR 57-61; 61-64) \n \n \nPolicy \n \n \nAs set forth in the regulation, every recommended personnel security decision \nmust be a fair and impartial overall common sense decision based on all available \nevidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The decision must be arrived at by applying \nthe standard that the grant or continuance of a security clearance or access to classified \ninformation is clearly within the interests of national security.  \n \n \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \neligible for a security clearance. Indeed the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of \na number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we \nshould view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and various \nother variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into \nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature \nthinking, and careful analysis. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIn all adjudications, national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information must be \nresolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \n  \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d1 demonstrating that it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Appellant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Appellant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.  Ultimately, Appellant has the burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 raises the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption:  \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions may raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) provide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n \n1 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of \ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being \nsupported by substantial evidence. Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. \nArea Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and, \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) clearly applies as Appellant was found guilty of two DUIs in \n2001 and 2004.  While he engaged in binge drinking in the military [AG \u00b6 22(c)], \nApplicant has not continued to drink to excess after he completed the ASAP program in \n2005. The clinical psychologist and alcohol abuse counselor he saw in 2004-05 \ndiagnosed Applicant as an alcohol abuser, not alcohol dependent [AG \u00b6 22(d)].  While \nthe clinical psychologist testified he preferred abstinence, he encouraged people in his \nprogram to develop realistic relapse programs and to drink only in moderation, but not \nto drive.  Applicant successfully chose abstinence in 2007 except for having three drinks \non New Year\u2019s Day and two drinks for his September 2007 birthday. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b), 22(e), and 22(g) do not apply: Appellant did not have any alcohol-\nrelated incidents at work; a licensed clinical social worker did not evaluate his alcohol \nproblem; Applicant complied with all court orders and received and completed alcohol \ncounseling in 2004-05.  He completed probation in 2007. No court orders concerning \nalcohol treatment were violated.  While Department Counsel argued that 22(f) applies, \nthere is insufficient information to determine whether his ASAP counseling constituted \nan \u201calcohol rehabilitation program\u201d and whether or not two drinks on his birthday \nconstitute a relapse. Clearly, he did not drive after drinking and has a better \nunderstanding of the importance of limits.   \n   \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) \npotentially apply:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) partially applies because his alcohol offenses were relatively \ninfrequent and he has not had any alcohol-related offenses since February 2004, over \nthree years ago.  His reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment were affirmed by \ntwo individuals for whom he worked at the time of the incident.  They never saw any \nindications of alcohol abuse at work.  Indeed since he was on call \u201c24/7\u201d because of the \nnature of his job, he was always punctual and reliable.  Both the site manager and his \nsupervisor praised him as an outstanding worker whom they would rehire immediately.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) does apply. Appellant addressed his alcohol issues and fully \ncomplied with all the court orders and completed the ASAP program in July 2005 and \ncompleted probation in July 2007. Dr B assessed Applicant as being very dedicated and \ncommitted to the treatment program.  While Applicant continued to drink after he \nfinished the court-ordered program, in 2007 he made a commitment to abstinence.  \nWhile he slipped twice, even on those two occasions where he did drink moderately, he \nmade a decision not to drive.  He no longer associates with individuals who drink and is \nengaged to someone who is a non-drinker.  Thus he has met the guideline as he has \nestablished his responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); a pattern of abstinence is \nrequired only if an individual is diagnosed as alcohol dependent which is not the case \nwith Applicant.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s expert did not give him a \u201cprognosis,\u201d but he highly commended \nApplicant\u2019s commitment to the program both while he was required by the courts to \nattend and subsequently as Applicant has called him for further guidance.   \n \n AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and 23(d) do not apply.  \n \nWeighing against mitigating is his recent alcohol-related behavior on his \nSeptember 2007 birthday, but even then he demonstrated moderation which is sufficient \nto mitigate the Guideline G conduct. After his second DUI in 2004, Appellant \nacknowledged his alcohol problem and changed his behavior.   While he had an arrest \n\n \n9 \n \n \nin 2005 for driving on a suspended and restricted license, that incident was not alcohol-\nrelated. To his credit he has had no subsequent alcohol-related incidents.  He has \ndemonstrated he has significantly changed his consumption of alcohol and now has a \ncommitment to sobriety and abstinence.  \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes security concerns about criminal conduct, \u201c[c]riminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in Appellant\u2019s case: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and, \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nAppellant was arrested in 2005 for a misdemeanor traffic offense, not a felony.   \nHe pleaded guilty and paid his fine. (SOR 2.a.)  While his omissions from his security \nform were also alleged as criminal conduct, I do not conclude that he had the requisite \nintent to falsify to establish that allegation under SOR 2.b. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAppellant falls with AG \u00b6 32(a) as so much time has elapsed since this \nmisdemeanor occurred.  Also, there were special mitigating and unusual circumstances \nthat would not recur, such as his having this incident just after he returned from an \noverseas trip.   His not noticing that his registration had expired led to the stop; while \ndriving on a suspended license is serious, he has completed his probation in 2007 and \nhas reformed his conduct that led to the suspended license; so such an arrest is unlikely \n\n \n10 \n \n \nto recur. Also he has established AG \u00b6 32(d) as he has had no subsequent \nquestionable conduct.  His reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment were attested \nto by two supervisors from the facility where he worked for over five years. \n \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d  \n \nWith respect to the four omissions alleged, the pertinent disqualifying condition is \nAG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about \none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d Certainly, failing to reveal his 2004 DUI arrest and \nthree UCMJ Article 15 issues on his security forms is a security concern.  However, \nApplicant admitted only that he read the questions too quickly.  He established that he \nhad no intent to falsify as he voluntarily told the security investigator about all of these \nincidents. \n \nEven if one were to view these omissions as intentional, Applicant has mitigated \nthese concerns.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c)-17(f) details three conditions that mitigate personal \nconduct security concerns in this case: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and,  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c)-17(e) mitigates the misdemeanor and article 15s:  Two of the four \noffenses were alcohol-related. He received counseling for his alcohol abuse as \ndiscussed above and has reformed his conduct.  He understands the implications for his \nfuture if he commits another alcohol-related offense. These offenses are unlikely to \nrecur; and they do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nWhole Person \n \n \nAlso, I considered the specific factors listed in AG \u00b6 2: \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence\u201d of the conduct at issue.   \n \nAppellant was convicted of two DUIs in 2001 and 2004, which are \nmisdemeanors. He acknowledged his problem with alcohol. He complied with the court-\nordered ASAP counseling, and has alleviated the circumstances or factors to reduce or \neliminate his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress with respect to \ncommitting DUIs and other alcohol-related offenses. He provided a solid presentation of \nhis character and loyalty in the endorsements of his supervisors. It is very unlikely he \nwill have another DUI. He focused his efforts and made substantial progress on \ncorrection of his alcohol abuse.  \n \nHaving reviewed the guidelines and assessed him as a \u201cwhole person\u201d in order \nto evaluate Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests, I find \nAppellant has mitigated all security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nALCOHOL CONSUMPTION: \n \nFor Appellant \n \n \nCRIMINAL CONDUCT: \n \n \nFor Appellant \n \n \nPERSONAL CONDUCT:  \n \nFor Appellant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant failed to mitigate financial security concerns arising from accumulated delinquent\ndebts totaling approximately $13,000 despite being employed in a responsible position since 2003.\nShe has paid, settled, or successfully disputed only $350 of the debts, and has no viable plan to do\nso with the other debts. While her intent to resolve them is strong, her actions and ability to do so\nto obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination is in doubt based on the record. Clearance is\ndenied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for an ADP clearance for Applicant.\nDOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether such a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nOn December 23, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a\nhearing. The matter was assigned to me on February 12, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMarch 28, 2007, for a hearing on April 16, 2007, and held that day. The government offered six\nexhibits and Applicant offered fourteen into evidence. All were accepted. The record was left open\nuntil May 15, 2007 for additional information to be submitted but none was received. The transcript\nwas received on April 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all but four of the 23 allegations relating to delinquent debts with\nexplanatory information. She appended several documents to her answer which were considered as\nevidence. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old customer service representative for a defense contractor health\nprovider and has held this position since September 2003. She filed a public trust position\napplication (SF 85P) for a trustworthiness determination on June 13, 2005. Before her present\nemployment she had periods of unemployment and under-employment causing her to accumulate\na large number of delinquent debts totaling approximately $13,000. \nAn analysis of her delinquent debts alleged in the SOR based on the documentary evidence\nand her testimony shows as follows for those alleged debts about which Applicant testified or had\ninformation:\n1. Par. 1.a.: Furniture purchase charged off in 2003 for $3,644. She still has the furniture and\n\n3\nhas not been in contact with the creditor. \n2. Par. 1.b. and c.: Two credit cards from same company each over $2,000 and charged off\nas unpaid in 2003.\n3. Par. 1.d.: Credit card debt of $1562 charged off in 2004. Applicant contacted creditor in\n2006 and was offered a settlement to be made in three payments. No action taken to resolve\nthe debt. Possibly same account as Par. 1.v. for $1,922, but not proven. \n4. Par. 1.e.: Credit card debt for $726 charged off in 2004 and settled with payment in\nDecember 2006 (Exh. K).\n5. Par. 1.f.: Telephone bill of $101. Same as 1.t. Paid in full.\n6. Par. 1.l.: Medical bill for $171. Same as 1.m. but no action taken to resolve.\n7. Par. 1.o.: Telephone bill of $160 paid in full in July 2005 with new phone bill.\n8. Par. 1.q.: Electric power bill $55. Applicant disputed the bill and it was resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n9. Par. 1.s.: Satellite TV account balance outstanding from her last move of residence.\nUnpaid and no contact with company. \n10. Par. 1.w.: Subject matter unknown and in dispute for $1,826.\nThus, there are a number of the alleged delinquent debts to which Applicant admitted but had\nneither information about them, and could show no effort to contact creditors and resolve them.\nApplicant has a responsible position working with medical information for military personnel\nand is highly regarded by her employer as stated in annual reviews and a letter from her supervisor\n(Exhs. A-D). Her work involves telephone calls to military personnel and their families regarding\nclaims for dental services against insurance companies and health service providers. She takes great\npride in her work. Her colleagues and friends speak highly of her character and integrity (Exhs. E-G).\nApplicant is a single parent of two sons ages 23 and 19 and a daughter age 8. Her first\nhusband served ten years in the Air Force serving abroad for part of the time. While overseas\nApplicant was employed on an Air Force base and was well regarded by her supervisors (Exhs. M\nand N) They were divorced in October 1998. She married a second time and was divorced. In June\n2005 she married for a third time. She received child support payments for her children for several\nyears and is still scheduled to receive support for her daughter (Exh. H). However, the payments\nfrom the father are behind almost $2,000 and scheduled monthly payments of $29 are irregular. He\ncurrently works as a prison security guard. \nApplicant\u2019s older son is employed and is self-sufficient. He also is a volunteer firefighter and\ndesires to join the Air Force to become a fourth generation service member. Her second son is still\n\n4\nin school and lives with Applicant\u2019s sister in another town to finish his high school in the same town\nwhere the family lived for several years. Applicant provides some funds for him and pays his auto\ninsurance on a car she purchased for him. Her daughter lives with Applicant and her husband. She\nis completely responsible for her daughter except for the child support payments.\nApplicant initiated a credit counseling program in March 2006 (Exh. I) and made payments\nto the counseling company for four months. She then discovered that no funds were being disbursed\nto her creditors so she canceled the program and was refunded her money. She has done nothing\nfurther in credit counseling since that time. She candidly admits that she is a poor money manager\nand that her credit is a \u201cwreck\u201d. She basically breaks even every month, but often has emergencies\nfor health or auto repairs for the family which adds to her debts. She has recently opened a 401k\naccount with her employer (Exh. L). In January 2007 she paid one account in full for over $700 and\na second account partially for $250 (Exhs. J and K). These were not accounts alleged in the SOR.\nAt the time she was interviewed by an investigator in this matter in March 2006, Applicant\nindicated her husband\u2019s monthly income was $4,000. They had been married less than a year. He no\nlonger has the same job and now has been unemployed for several months. He is hoping to find new\nwork but has physical and emotional problems that may make it difficult for him to obtain and keep\nemployment. He filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy before their marriage and pays $571 to the bankruptcy\ncourt to resolve the bankruptcy. There is a possibility that she might become liable for the payments\nif he cannot make them. Since their marriage less than two years ago they have been separated for\nfive months but they are now living together. \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

In Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, \u00a7 3.1(b) (August 4,\n1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only\nto United States citizens \u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to\nthe United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound\njudgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness\nand ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified\ninformation.\u201d  \nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\u201d DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  DoD 5200.2-R,\n\n5\nAppendix 8. An administrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and\ncarefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person. Id. Also, an administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Id. The adjudicative\nguidelines (AG), as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1, 2006, apply to ADP\ntrustworthiness determinations. \nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive\n5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made. DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C8.2.1.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.14. Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment. The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7 7.\nIt is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s 23 delinquent debts totaling approximately $13,000 as alleged in the SOR\nprompted the allegation of security concern under Guideline F since an individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c), and evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts (AG \u00b6\n19 a).\nMitigating Conditions (MC) might include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances (AG \u00b6 20 b), and the person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts (AG \u00b6 20 d). There is some evidence that the debts resulted from\nconditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control but she has admitted to being a poor money manager and the\n\n6\nevidence indicates she has not acted responsibly while employed and married to a husband who was\nemployed. Her effort to begin credit counseling was praiseworthy but she dropped the program. \nWhile Applicant has made some contact with a few of the creditors, she has not done so with\nmost of them. She has paid three of the smaller delinquent debts totaling $350 alleged on the SOR\nand two more not on the SOR, but that is not a sufficient number considering that there still 19\noutstanding or for a total amount sufficient to justify application of the mitigating conditions. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nApplicant is a proud person who is a hard-working responsible parent doing a good job for\nher employer. Her delinquent debts accumulated largely as a result of a checkered history of\nemployment at low wages and lack of employment for periods of time resulting in a loss of control\nof her finances. She is anxious to provide for her children despite limited resources. She has\nsignificant responsibilities and now has a job where she is a valued employee. However, her total\nincome does not appear to be sufficient to resolve all her debts in a timely way even with the will\nto do so. Thus, she has the right intent but probably lacks the ability to resolve the issues that\npreclude her from receiving a favorable grant at this time. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I deny the grant of a trustworthiness determination. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq.,  Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nCharles S. Parnell, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\n  Applicant has had a history of overdue debts that have not been resolved.  The information\nthat she provided to the Government in a Security Clearance Application (SCA) on July 8, 2005,\nregarding her indebtedness, was materially incorrect and incomplete, but the evidence has not\nestablished that Applicant knowingly provided false information. Mitigation has not been shown.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 13, 2006 , the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Exhibit 1) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant\nand recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ndenied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated January 5, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations (RSOR) (Exhibit 2). She requested that her case be decided on the written record in lieu\nof a hearing.\nOn May 30, 2007, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete\ncopy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and she was given the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A\nresponse was due by July 11, 2007, but no response to the FORM was filed. The case was assigned\nto this Administrative Judge on August 20, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel offered eight documentary items (Exhibits 1-8), which have been\nadmitted without objection. Applicant offered no documentary evidence into the record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains 7 allegations, 1.a., through 1.g., under Guideline F,\ntwo allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline E, and one allegation, 3.a., under Guideline J.\nApplicant has admitted SOR allegations 1.a. and 1.g., and she has denied the other allegations. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nSince this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to\nthe contents of the various documents that are found in the case file. After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the FORM,  and the\nadmitted documents, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Additional\n\n3\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 53 years old. She is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists seven allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.g, under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. These debts will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,199. In her\nRSOR (Exhibit 2), Applicant admits this debt was incurred by her husband on a credit card for which\nshe was jointly liable. She contends that she was unaware of it before she received the SOR. In\nResponses to Interrogatories, signed by Applicant on October 10, 2006, (Exhibit 6) Applicant denies\nthat this debt is hers, as she claims it is a disputed bill from her husband\u2019s \u201cold company.\u201d This\ncontradicts her response to the SOR in two places. First she claims that she was unaware of the bill\nuntil the SOR, but clearly she had notice of the bill at least since she received the interrogatories.\nAlso, on the interrogatories she denies that she was responsible for the debt, but on her RSOR, she\nconcedes liability for this debt.  \nFinally, Applicant states that this debt  is no longer listed on her most current credit report,\nand she also cites Colorado Revised Statute 13-80-103.5 to argue that the statute of limitations to\nenforce this obligation has expired.  I find that insufficient evidence has been introduced to\ndetermine if the statute is applicable in this case, and based on the above discussed inconsistencies\nin her responses, I can not find that this debt has been resolved.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,887.82.\nApplicant denies this debt and contends that she has disputed this debt for years. Exhibit 7, a credit\nreport, dated January 4, 2006, shows that this debt was disputed by consumer, and that it has been\nresolved. While it is not clear what the outcome of the debt is, I find that this debt has been resolved.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $237. In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that she was unaware of this debt , but after she received the SOR, she paid the\ndebt. However, in her Responses to Interrogatories (Exhibit 6), which she executed a month before\nshe received the SOR, she claimed that she had already paid this debt. Based on this discrepancy and\nthe lack of any independent evidence to establish payment of this debt,   I can not find that this debt\nhas been resolved.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $136.48. In her\nRSOR, Applicant claims that she was unaware of this debt , but after she received the SOR, she paid\nthe debt.  In her Responses to Interrogatories (Exhibit 6), Applicant claimed that she had already paid\nthis debt, but she only included evidence of one payment of $45.49. I find that Applicant still owes\nthe remainder of the debt. \n\n4\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $78.43. In her\nRSOR, Applicant claims that she was unaware of this debt , but after she received the SOR, she paid\nthe debt.  Based on the lack of any independent evidence to establish payment of this debt,   I can\nnot find that this debt has been resolved.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $156. In her RSOR,\nApplicant claims that she was unaware of this debt , but after she received the SOR, she paid the\ndebt.  Based on the lack of any independent evidence to establish payment of this debt,   I can not\nfind that this debt has been resolved.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,852.02. In her\nRSOR, Applicant admits this debt was incurred by her husband on a credit card for which she was\njointly liable. She contends that she was unaware of it before she received the SOR, In Responses\nto Interrogatories (Exhibit 6) Applicant denies that this debt is hers, as she claims it is a disputed bill.\nAgain, she twice contradicts her response to the SOR. First she claims that she was unaware of the\nbill until the SOR, but clearly she had notice of the bill at least since she received the interrogatories.\nAlso, on the interrogatories she denies that she was responsible for the debt, but on her RSOR, she\nconcedes liability for this debt. \n \nFinally, Applicant cites Colorado Revised Statute 13-80-103.5 to argue that the statute of\nlimitations to enforce this obligation has expired.  I find that insufficient evidence has been\nintroduced to determine if the statute is applicable in this case, and based on the above discussed\ninconsistencies in her responses, I can not find that this debt has been resolved.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nwhen Applicant completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on July 8, 2005,\nshe furnished untruthful information to the Government (Exhibit 5). \n2.a. Question #38 asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. At the time she completed the SCA, Applicant\nhad been over 180 days delinquent on the debts listed on the SOR, as discussed above, and she\nshould have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question and included the debts listed in the SOR that were\noverdue.\n2.b. Question #39 asks,  \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to this question and again listed no debts. At the time she completed the\nSCA, Applicant was still delinquent on the debts listed on the SOR, and she should have included\nall of these debts. \nIn her RSOR, Applicant claims that she was not aware that any of these debts were overdue\nat the time she competed the SCA, and that she did not deliberately provide false information to the\nGovernment. In the FORM, Department Counsel states that a credit report, provided by Applicant\nwith her Responses to Interrogatories, lists all of the debts on the SOR. However, the Government\nhas not provided the evidence to establish that Applicant had this credit report or other information\n\n5\nthat these debts were owed, at the time she completed the SCA.\nParagraph 3  (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nshe has engaged in criminal conduct as she furnished information on a SCA to the Government in\n2005 that was not complete and truthful. This act is a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United\nStates Code Section 1001.\nHowever, since it has not been proven that Applicant knowingly and\nwilfully provided false information to the Government,  Title 18, United States Code Section 1001,\ndoes not apply in this case.\n \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise\ndoubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden\nof persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \"the clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance. This the\n\n7\nApplicant has not done.\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines F, E, and J: \n(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly\nestablishes Applicant's long history of indebtedness, and there is no evidence that Applicant has\nresolved these overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F in the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, I conclude both DC 19 (a) and (c) apply, because of Appellant\u2019s \u201chistory of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d and her apparent \u201cunwillingness to satisfy her debts.\u201d \nIn considering the Mitigating Conditions (MC) 20, I do not find that any of the MCs  apply\nI, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant. \nUntil Applicant makes a good-faith effort and can prove that she has resolved her overdue\ndebts, and she can establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will\ncontinue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.\n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided incorrect\nmaterial information to the Government in response to two questions on the SCA that she executed\nin 2005. Applicant was delinquent on the debts discussed above, and she should have answered\n\u201cYes\u201d to questions #38, and #39,  and included on her SCA all of the debts discussed above.\nHowever, Applicant denies that she was aware of these overdue debts when she completed her SCA,\nand there is no evidence to contradict her contention. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against Applicant.\nI therefore, resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\n(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government has been unable to establish that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct,\nas she did not knowingly furnished information to the Government that was incomplete and\nuntruthful. Therefore, no violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code Section 1001 was\ncommitted. \nUnder Guideline J,  I conclude that no DC applies, and I resolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against   Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E: For APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: For Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline J: For APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nItem 7.\n2\nItems 5, 6 and 7.\n3\n2\nApplicant is 42 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since March 2003. She has\nmore than $17,000 in delinquent debts that she has not paid. She did not provide any information\nto mitigate the concerns raised by her financial situation. On her security clearance application she\ndeliberately failed to divulge any of her delinquencies. Applicant failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 22, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.\nIn a sworn statement dated September  12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.\nApplicant elected to have her case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on January 11, 2007. The FORM was mailed to\nApplicant on January 12, 2007, and received on January 22, 2007. Applicant was afforded an\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\nhad no response. The case was assigned to me on March 8, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 42 years old and has worked as a custodian for a federal contractor since March\n2003. She has been steadily employed since 1988. Applicant married in 1989, and has been separated\nfrom her husband since 1992. She has two children, ages 22 and 18. \nApplicant admits she owes the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i-1.l. She denies\nthe allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 2.a, and 2.b. Her credit reports verify that there are zero balances on\ndebts \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h that she claimed are paid.  No information was provided regarding whether she\n2\nhas set up a repayment plan, contacted her creditors or has made any attempt to resolve her other\ndelinquent debts. She did not provide any information to show the debts were incurred because of\nconditions beyond her control or that she has received any financial counseling to assist her in\nresolving her debts. Some of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts show that there has been no activity on\nthem for several years, some are charged off and some are in a collection status.3\n\nItem 2.\n4\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n5\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n6\n3\nApplicant signed her security clearance application on June 7, 2004, and again on May 19,\n2005. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to Question 38, which asked: \u201cYour Financial\nDelinquencies-In the last 7 years have you ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d She\nalso answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 39, which asked: \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies-90 Days Are you\ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant denied she deliberately failed to list\nher debts. Her explanation was \u201cI misunderstood the question, which [I] told the person who\ninterviewed me that [I] misunderstood the question.\u201d  Her answer was the same for both questions.\n4\nNo other information was provided by Applicant. She did not provide any  amplifying information\nas to specifically what she misunderstood or what confused her about the questions. Applicant has\nmore than  $17,000 of delinquent debt from ten accounts. Some of her debts were placed for\ncollection or charged off in 2002. The delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is for $6,087; \u00b6 1.f is for $4,594;\n\u00b6 1.i is for $2, 573, and \u00b6 1.a is for $1,159. All of these debts are substantial amounts. She admits\nall of them and all are in a collection status. The questions on the SCA are very clear. The heading\nstates \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies-180 Days.\u201d It goes on to ask if in the past 7 years have you\never been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d She failed to list any of her debts. She did the\nsame for her debts that were 90 days past due. Considering the number of debts, the amount of the\ndebts, the fact that many of the debts were in a collection status for a long period of time, and the\nprobability that she received notifications from these creditors, I find Applicant deliberately did not\nlist her delinquent debts in Questions 38 and 39. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n5\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n6\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n7\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n10\nId.\n11\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n12\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n7\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n8\ndecision.  \n9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n10\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n11\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n12\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n13\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.\n\u2018\nBased on all of the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) FC\nDC E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts), apply in this case. Applicant has many delinquent debts that she\nfailed to pay. Many have had no activity on them for years. She admits she owes the debts and they\nare delinquent.\nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC E.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (It was\nan isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation)),  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant has paid two delinquent debts. She has not provided any mitigating information\nregarding her other delinquent debts. No evidence was provided to explain how her debts became\ndelinquent and why some have not been paid for years. No evidence was provided to show she is\nattempting to resolve the debts or has made a good-faith effort to repay her debts. Applicant simply\nhas not provided anything by way of mitigation to consider. Therefore, I find none of the financial\nconsideration mitigating conditions apply.\nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2A5.1.2.2\n(The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.) applies. Applicant deliberately failed to list her\ndebts that were over 180 days delinquent and were 90 days past due. \nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ), and especially\nconsidered PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (The individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts) and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (The individual has\ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress). I\nfind neither applies. Applicant did not promptly provide the correct information for her security\nclearance application, but waited until she was confronted and interviewed by an investigator. She\nstated she misunderstood the questions, but failed to explain what she misunderstood or what may\nhave been confusing to her. A blanket statement that she misunderstood is not enough to meet any\nof the mitigating criteria when considering all of the facts in the record. An applicant\u2019s financial\nhistory is a matter that could affect a final agency decision on whether to grant the applicant a\nclearance, and an applicant\u2019s failure to disclose it would impede a thorough investigation of her\nbackground. At the time she completed her SCA, I find she was aware that she had delinquent debts\nand deliberately failed to reveal them. I find the questions in the SCA are quite clear and not\n\n6\nconfusing. The heading alone puts the Applicant on notice as to what the question is all about. Her\nclaim that she misunderstood the question is not enough, based on all of the other evidence to\nconvince me she did not understand the questions. I considered the number of debts, the amounts of\nthe debts, the lengthy period many have been in collection status or charged off, and that she was\nrequired to list them in Questions 38 and 39. I also considered that the questions are quite clear as to\nwhat information is being requested and that Applicant\u2019s admissions to the debts corroborates that\nshe was aware of them. It is not credible to believe based on the information provided that she did not\nunderstand the questions. Having found Applicant deliberately failed to divulge the information, I also\nfind Applicant did not provide any evidence or reassurance that she has taken positive steps to reduce\nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. None of the personal conduct\nmitigating conditions apply.\nThe Whole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age and length\nof employment, the number of debts and how long they have been in collection or charged off status,\nthe debts she has paid and the lack of information regarding the resolution of her other debts. I also\nconsidered the clear language of Questions 38 and 39 on the SCA. I am persuaded by the totality of\nthe evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\na security clearance. Accordingly, Guidelines E and F are decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2\nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

However, he was not forthcoming about these incidents on\nfour separate occasions during the application process when he initially submitted a security\nclearance application in March 2003, and reaffirmed in September 2003 and again in February 2004,\nand when submitted a second security application in October 2005.  Applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from his falsifications.  Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On November 27, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013personal conduct (Guideline E) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting in an undated notarized response, which was received by DOHA on December 29, 2006.\nIn his response, he elected to have a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  \nThe case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007.  On February 28, 2007, DOHA issued\na notice of hearing scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for March 15, 2007.  Applicant stated he received\nsufficient notice and was ready to proceed.  Tr. 11.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  \nThe government offered five exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5.  The Applicant offered four exhibits, which were admitted with objection\nas Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on\nMarch 28, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel asked me to take administrative notice of Article 111,\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), drunken or reckless operation of a vehicle, aircraft, or\nvessel.  Reference was made to Article 111, UCMJ, in SOR \u00b6 1.d.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802\nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR\nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or taken from government reports. See Stein,\nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for\n\n3\nadministrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my consideration of Article 111, UCMJ for\npurposes of administrative notice. Tr. 11-12. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h., i.e. the four falsification\ncharges cited in the SOR.  He did admit to \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant testified at his hearing and I did not find his testimony credible.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old Third Class Engineer for a defense contractor.  He has been\nemployed part-time by this defense contractor since October 2005.  Additionally, he is an active duty\nAir Force Staff Sergeant, pay grade E-5, with an Air Force Specialty Code of 3E171, Heating,\nVentilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration.  He has been in the Air Force since September\n1992 and as an active duty member of the Air Force, he holds a secret clearance.

He has been working on his associate\u2019s\ndegree, maintaining a 4.0 GPA, and is two classes from completing his degree.  Tr. 24-25.\nApplicant was married to his first wife from October 1996 to November 2001.  GE 1.  That\nmarriage ended by divorce.  Applicant has been married to his second wife since March 2005.  GE\n1.  Applicant has a 10-year-old son born from a relationship with a former girlfriend for whom he\nprovides child support.  His son lives with his mother.  Applicant has no other children.\nThe SOR alleged four separate incidents to which Applicant admitted in his Answer to the\nSOR.  They are:\n1. That he was awarded non-judicial punishment (NJP) on September 27, 2005, and found\nguilty of wrongfully using a government computer to view pornographic images.  He was sentenced\nto be reprimanded, and reduced one pay grade.  His reduction in grade was suspended for six\nmonths.  (SOR \u00b6 1.a.).  Applicant signed his Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings on\nSeptember 27, 2005, indicating that he did not desire to appeal.  GE 4.;\n2.  That he was arrested on July 21, 2002, and charged with disorderly conduct.  This charge\nwas dismissed.  (SOR \u00b6 1.b.).  GE 3.;\n\n4\n3.  That he was cited on May 5, 2001 and charged with provoking speech/gestures while at\nan overseas Air Force base.  (SOR \u00b6 1.c.)  Apparently, no further action was taken against the\nApplicant.; and\n4.  That he was awarded NJP on April 19, 1998, and found guilty of drunken or reckless\noperation of a vehicle.  He was sentenced to be reduced one pay grade.  His reduction in grade was\nsuspended for six months.  (SOR \u00b6 1.d.).  GE 5.\nOn October 5, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86).  He\nresponded negatively to question 23(d) inquiring whether he had ever been charged with or convicted\nof any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs, and to question 23(e) inquiring whether in the last seven\nyears he had ever been subject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ\nto include non-judicial punishment. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.a.)\nThese responses were clearly untrue in light on his having been awarded non-judicial\npunishment as recently as September 27, 2005 for wrongfully using a government computer to view\npornographic images (SOR \u00b6 1.a.), and for his having been awarded non-judicial punishment on\nApril 18, 1998 for drunken or reckless operation of a vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.d).   \nOn March 27, 2003, Applicant completed an SF-86, which he reaffirmed on September 29,\n2003, and again on February 17, 2004.  He responded negatively to question 24 inquiring whether\nhe had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs, and to\nquestion 26 inquiring whether in the last seven years he had been arrested, charged with, or\nconvicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25.  (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.b.).\nThese responses were clearly untrue in light of his having been awarded non-judicial\npunishment on April 18, 1998 for drunken or reckless operation of a vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.d.), and for\nhis having been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for these omissions varied.  As to SOR \u00b6 1.e., referring to his NJP\non April 19, 1998, Applicant explained he \u201cwas led to believe that because this incident happened\non a military installation overseas and dealt with by military members overseas that it would not\ninvolve my civilian background in any manner.  Being that I am in the military and this incident\nhappened on a military installation handled by military personnel, I did not understand that I had a\n\u201cPolice Record.\u201d  Therefore I answered \u201cNO\u201d to this question.\u201d  Answer to SOR.\nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.f., referring to his NJP on September 27, 2005, Applicant explained \u201cThe\nquestion asked in the last 7 years have you been subject to court martial or other disciplinary\nproceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  I answered \u201cNO\u201d to this question because\ninitially at the time I was asked this question I was in the process of receiving punishment for\nwrongfully using a Government Computer incident and hadn\u2019t actually received punishment.  I\nclearly misunderstood the question entirely!\u201d  Answer to SOR.\n\n5\nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.g., referring to his NJP on April 19, 1998, Application explained \u201cBecause\nI was led to believe that because this incident happened on a military installation overseas and dealt\nwith my military members overseas that it would not involve my civilian background in any manner.\nI was led to believe that this matter would be in military file for 2 years and would not follow me\nafterwards.  Therefore I answered \u201cNO\u201d to this question.\u201d  Answer to SOR.\nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.h., referring to his arrest and being charged with disorderly conduct on July\n21, 2002, Applicant explained \u201cI admit\u201d to being arrested in [location] on July 22 (sic), 2002.  \u201cI\ndeny\u201d deliberately falsifying material facts by saying \u201cNO\u201d to the question because I was told by my\nlawyer at that time that the manner would be expunged and I specifically asked about this involving\nmy security clearance.  He said that if asked about the arrest to say \u201cNO\u201d because it did not happen.\u201d\nAnswer to SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for these discrepancies during his hearing did not vary significantly\nfrom the explanations given in his Answer to SOR, outlined above.\nApplicant submitted five reference letters, 16 copies of different awards and achievements,\n28 pages of training documents, and six pages of personal military history and information forms.\nAE A through D.  The collective sense of these documents is that Applicant is a bright and motivated\nindividual, who has made a substantial contribution to the Air Force during his 14 plus years of\nactive duty.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure\n2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\n3\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,\n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of\ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported\nby substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d\nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,\n380 (4  Cir. 1994). \nth\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n4\n[evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides]\nwhether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2\n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n6\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth\nand discussed in the Conclusions section below.  Since the protection of the national security is the\nparamount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that\nthe issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching\nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n3\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n7\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nThe security concern under Guideline E, is that \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 15.\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe SOR alleges four minor offenses that occurred some time ago that gave rise to concerns\nidentified in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.  First, an NJP for drunken or reckless operation of a vehicle that\noccurred in 1998 while Applicant was overseas, for which he received a suspended reduction.\nSecond, a citation/charge for provoking speech/gestures that occurred in 2001 while Applicant was\noverseas, and for which no action was taken against Applicant.  Third, an arrest in 2002 for\ndisorderly conduct, for which the charge was dismissed.  Fourth, an NJP for wrongfully using a\ngovernment computer to view pornographic images in 2005, for which he received a suspended\nreduction and a reprimand.\nTypically, under the UCMJ, NJP is reserved for the adjudication of minor offenses.  It is\nfurther noted both his respective commanders who awarded Applicant NJP suspended his\npunishment.  The civilian charge of disorderly conduct charge was dismissed and the provoking\nspeech/gestures charge apparently did not result in any adverse action being taken against Applicant.\nWhile these charges document a higher level of law enforcement intervention than desired for\nApplicants seeking a security clearance, certain factors must be considered.  Those include the time\nelapsed, the fact that two of the offenses were adjudicated in the lesser forum of NJP for which his\npunishment was suspended, the remaining two offenses resulted in a dismissal and/or no action being\ntaken against Applicant, and there were no recurrences of the same or similar conduct.  \n\n8\nUnder the Directive, these four incidents raise potential concerns under disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 16.(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered\nas a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.  Under\nthe facts of this case, Applicant is able to benefit from mitigating condition (MC) 17.(c): the offense\nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nUnder the particular facts and circumstances of this case, I conclude Applicant would not be\nprohibited from holding a security clearance as a result of SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.  That\nis not the case for the remaining concerns raised under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. through 1.h.\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. through 1.h. alleged Applicant falsified material facts on two of the SF-86s he\nsubmitted, the first on October 5, 2005, and the second originally signed on March 27, 2003, and\nreaffirmed on the two separate dates of September 29, 2003, and on February 17, 2004.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for failing to list these offenses/incidents are simply not credible.\nIn particular, it is inconceivable that he would be awarded NJP on September 27, 2005 for\nwrongfully using a government computer, and eight days later when completing his SF-86 on\nOctober 5, 2005, claim his failure to list that NJP was that he was in the \u201cprocess of receiving\npunishment . . . and hadn\u2019t actually received punishment.\u201d  Having signed his Record on Nonjudicial\nPunishment Proceedings on September 27, 2005, indicating he did not desire to appeal his\npunishment suggests something other than being in the \u201cprocess of receiving punishment.\u201d  His other\nexplanations such as misunderstanding that he had a police record, that he thought being a military\nmember overseas would not involve his civilian background, or that his unknown lawyer told him\nto answer \u201cno\u201d to security clearance questions involving his being arrested and charged with\ndisorderly conduct are equally disingenuous.\nApplicant is a bright and articulate individual with over 14 years in the Air Force.  He has\nheld a security clearance since he has been in the Air Force and is no stranger to the process.  He\nprovided considerable documentation expounding his many accomplishments in the Air Force.  It\nis unfortunate that he chose not to disclose four relatively minor offenses.  In my view, such\ndisclosure would probably not have precluded him from being granted a security clearance.  When\nan Applicant does not provide complete and accurate information, the government is justified in\nhaving a concern about that person\u2019s personal integrity.  Applicant demonstrated a pattern of not\ntelling the truth on at least four occasions during this application process.\nApplicable is DC 16.(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification or relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\n\n9\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  None of the\nDirective\u2019s mitigating conditions apply.\nThe \u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept.  Applicant is a mature individual with many years of service to this country as a\nservice member and an employee of a defense contractor.  As indicated above, it is my view the four\nrelatively minor infractions which Applicant chose to deny when undergoing the security clearance\nprocess would not have precluded him from being granted a clearance.\nUnfortunately, Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his two SF-86s on four separate\noccasions raised significant concerns.  As a mature individual, Applicant knew or should have\nknown of the significance of these documents.  His deliberate submission of inaccurate information\n\u2013 not once, but four times \u2013 is very troublesome.  His explanations for providing inaccurate\ninformation are quite frankly unimpressive.  Weighing all the facts and circumstances, I find\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the falsification of his security\nclearance applications.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nRobert J.

(TR 8; 14)\n2\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns over his continuing to drink despite his 2005\ntreatment and a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and over his continuing to gamble despite substantial\nfinancial concerns.  His alcohol abuse was documented in his medically recommended treatment in\n2005 where he failed to complete aftercare.  While he has taken some steps to reform his conduct,\nhe failed to demonstrate sufficient positive changes in behavior supportive either of his willingness\nto stop gambling or to commit to sobriety.  Consequently, security concerns remain over finances\nand alcohol.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on September 19, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over\n1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 and  Alcohol Consumption (Guideline G) in\nparagraph 2 based on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on December 29, 2005,\n2\nand implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant responded\nto these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer received on October 16, 2006, where he admitted\nparagraph 1 allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e. with explanation in and denied 1.f.  With respect to\nparagraph 2 he denied allegations 2.a., 2.b., and admitted in part and denied in part allegation 2.c.\nHe requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on November 1, 2006, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The\nmatter was assigned to me on December 15, 2006. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for\nhearing was agreed to; and a Notice of Hearing, issued on February 16, 2007, set the matter for\nMarch 16, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works and lives. Applicant received the notice\non February 26, 2007, within the 15-day notice requirement.  On March 2, 2007, his counsel entered\nhis appearance and made a Motion for Continuance for two months time in order to prepare for the\nhearing.  On March 5, 2007, I denied the Request for Continuance as he failed to establish a \u201cgood\ncause\u201d basis as required by the Directive.  Subsequently, on March 14, 2007, Applicant\u2019s counsel\nagain requested a continuance as his mother had died.  While initially denying the request, I\nsubsequently reconsidered and granted his request for a continuance on March 15, 2007.  A Notice\nof Hearing, issued on March 15, 2007, cancelled the matter.  A March 30, 2007 Notice of Hearing\nre-set the case hearing for May 17, 2007. \nAt the hearing the Government offered seven exhibits  (Exhibit 1-7) which were admitted\ninto evidence and called one witness, Mr. R, who was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\n\n       The collective bargaining agreement will require him to have a secret clearance by September 2007.\n3\n(TR 104-105)\n3\ncontract investigator who had interviewed Applicant. Applicant testified, called three witnesses, and\nsubmitted Exhibits A through C. Government\u2019s counsel indicated no objection, so the documents\nwere admitted into evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on June 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \nApplicant, 38 years old, has worked for a defense contractor from November 2005 to present.\nHe completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing (\u201ceQip\u201d) to obtain a security\nclearance  in November 2005.  Previously, he worked for another employer from April to November\n3\n2005.  He received unemployment pay during this period.  From October 2004 to April 2005 he was\nthe front office manager at a hotel until they terminated him.  He was unemployed from August to\nOctober 2004 as he had resigned from another hotel where he had worked from 2003 to 2004 when\nthey cut his hours. He had a variety of previous jobs including working as a city employee from June\nto September 2002 when he had an injury covered by worker\u2019s compensation from September 2002\nto July 2003.  Previously, he was a federal mail handler from 1996 to 1999 until he was injured.  He\nleft that job to return to school for a master\u2019s degree.  While he had requested a leave of absence for\ntwo years to return to school, his supervisor did not approve it.  (Exhibit 1, Exhibit C; TR 78-79; 81;\n86-87; 94-95; 96\u2013103; 104-105; 135-138)  Applicant served in the National Guard from 1987 to\n1993 and was honorably discharged.  (Exhibit 1; TR 77-78)\nApplicant received a Master\u2019s in Public Administration from a state university in June 2001.\nHe received a Bachelors degree in December 1997.  (Exhibit 1; TR 49; 80-91; 136) Applicant\nmarried in October 1992.  Applicant\u2019s wife works at the U.S. postal service and has been employed\nthere for over twenty years.  (Exhibit 1; TR 82-83)  He has a child born in 2000. (Exhibit 1; TR 96)\nFinances\nApplicant disclosed that in October 2002 he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in order to\ndischarge $70,000 in debt as he failed to live within his means.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 3, 4, 7; TR 83;\n138-139)  His unsecured debts were discharged in bankruptcy in January 2003.  (Exhibit 2) \n In an investigative interview conducted in March 2006, Applicant admitted that he and his\nspouse began to gamble in 1992. They each have a gambling addiction that contributed to the\nbankruptcy debt.  He stated to the investigator that he planned to continue to gamble in moderation\nin the future.  He and his wife withdrew cash from credit cards to gamble which increased the debt\ndischarged. He had total liability of $195,4000, but $116,000 was his mortgage on his home which\nwas secured debt; his student loan was not discharged.  (Answer; Exhibits 3, 4; TR 29-37; 107-108;\n109-110; 139-142)\n\n4\nEven though he has attended Gamblers Anonymous (GA) twice a month from November\n1998 to 2006 which recommends stopping gambling, Applicant and his spouse have continued to\ngamble.  Their current practice is to gamble, spending approximately $400 per month.  However,\nin 2006 he admitted they doubled that amount per month as he and his wife\u2019s gambling progressed\nover the years.  He conceded in October 2006 that this gambling issue \u201cmust be corrected\nimmediately.\u201d  (Answer; TR 117-117; 124-125) Applicant conceded to the investigator that his wife\ngambles and \u201cthat he cannot stop her.\u201d He estimated the gambling expenses in 2006 totaled\napproximately $5,000 per year. (Exhibit 4; TR 36; 49-50; 83-84; 110-111; 118-119)  \nSince the bankruptcy discharge, he estimated half of the $30,000 of debt on his credit cards\nin March 2006 was due to gambling in the past three years, or a total of $15,000.  (Exhibits 3, 7; TR\n114-117; 139) As of February 2007  he developed $121,000 in new debt since his bankruptcy as he\nhad eleven credit cards which were at their maximum level of debt.  However, he then consolidated\nhis debts to pay off the credit cards and has a line of credit loan of $26,000 secured by his home\nwhere he will pay $160 per month for ten years.  (Exhibits 3,7; TR 143-146; 150-151; 156-157)\nApplicant conceded he made a decision to refinance so \u201cthere\u2019s money there, and gamble, we\u2019ve got\nto gamble.\u201d (TR 146-155) \nApplicant\u2019s current gross pay is between $3300 and $3,400 per month with take home pay\nof $2,400 per month plus $200 for a partial disability.  His wife makes $53,000 per year, so her take\nhome pay is around $3,000 per month.  His monthly mortgage payment is $803, and car payments\nare $968.  After paying his debts, they have $3,000 for monthly living expenses and are able to live\nwithin their means.  He has a budget, but the family does not follow a budget.  They have not taken\nany financial courses.  However he has taken an accounting course and consults with  his father who\nis an accountant on financial matters.  (TR 146-158)\nApplicant and his wife continue to gamble. He gambled two weeks before the hearing.  His\nwife gambled the weekend before the hearing.  In the first five months of 2007 he had lost an\nestimated $1,000 through gambling.  Applicant attended GA as recently as two weeks before the\nhearing.  He attends about every three weeks.  He does not believe his continuing to gamble is a\nproblem even though the goal of GA is to have an individual stop gambling. (TR 93-94; 111-114)\nHis intent is to stop gambling but he conceded it is difficult as his wife continues to gamble. (TR\n120-124; 159-160)\nAlcohol\nApplicant disclosed he began drinking as a teenager and continued to drink for twenty years\nat times to excess and to the point of intoxication to at least February 2006.  However, he had no\nalcohol-related incidents.  He attributed his current drinking in part to his city employment believes\nin 2002.  (Answer; TR 52, 77, 127-128)  His use of alcoholic beverages resulted in alcohol-related\ntreatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism) as he participated in an alcohol\nprogram at a medical center on a voluntary basis from August to October 2005 for a condition\ndiagnosed, in part, as Alcohol Abuse. (Answer; Exhibits 1, 4, 5, 6; TR 30-39; 128-129) \nApplicant completed a \u201cmini-Intensive Treatment Program) from August 2 to 24, 2005. \nThat program met for three days per week for four weeks to provide education and support for the\ndevelopment of abstinence skills.  He successfully completed \u201cPhase 1 of treatment.\u201d  However, after\n\n       The investigator did not ascertain the medical credentials of Applicant\u2019s doctor; however, she was not\n4\ninvolved in his alcohol treatment, but referred him to the treatment program.  (Exhibit 5; TR 55-58)\n       The expert explained he agreed to do an evaluation of Applicant as he is a friend of his lawyer.  His\n5\nframe of reference is the homeless men in his program; however he used the Hazelden model. The program\npsychologist at his program did not independently assess Applicant. He based his opinion solely on the\ninformation that Applicant disclosed to him when he concluded Applicant was a social drinker.  (TR 21-23;\n24)\n5\nhe completed eight weeks of Phase 2 treatment of a recommended twelve weeks, he did not continue\nand complete Phase 2 treatment as work was his priority.  He last attended October 27, 2005.\n(Exhibits A, B; TR 47-49; 87-88; 90; 132-134) He viewed Phase 2 as an aftercare program like\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) which he saw as optional as he had entered the program voluntarily.\n(TR 88-91; 129-130) However, he did not seek another support mechanism, such as AA, as he did\nnot want other people to know that he had an alcohol problem. (TR 130-131; 135)\nSince his treatment, he continues to drink, but he only drinks a \u201ccouple of beers\u201d 95% of the\ntime.  He told the investigator he was last intoxicated eight months prior to the March 2006\ninterview.  (Answer; Exhibit 4; TR 50-51; 51-55)  Applicant believes he is \u201calmost completely\ncured. . . . 95 percent  of the time.\u201d  However, he is not abstinent.  (TR 92; 127) He drinks alcohol\nin moderation.  (TR 132)\nTreatment records were summarized for the investigator by his doctor  in April 2006 who\n4\nreported that Applicant was a primary care patient assigned to her in March 2001; she continued to\ntreat him and last saw him in July 2005.  As he was actively using alcohol then, he was referred to\na substance abuse clinic for treatment.  In 2005 he reported that he was continuing to drink three to\nfour beers a night and also reported his gambling addiction which troubled him emotionally.  After\nOctober 2005 Applicant failed to come to subsequent appointments at the treatment center.  She\nconcluded that his \u201csubstance abuse\u201d and other issues may impact on his ability to properly\nsafeguard sensitive or classified information.\u201d  The condition might impact and impair his judgment\nand reliability.  She would not recommend him for a position involving national security as he did\nnot follow up on his prescribed treatment for substance abuse and other health issues.  She had\nconcerns about relapse.  (Exhibit 5; TR 39-46; 84-86; 158-159)\nThe clinic records were also summarized and reflected that Applicant sought treatment in\nAugust 2005 and attended nine sessions until October 2005.  He reported a ten year history of\ndrinking as he had his first drink at age 12 and that drinking had adversely affected him. (Exhibit 6;\nTR 44-46)\nApplicant\u2019s expert witness, Mr. O, who has been an alcohol and drug abuse counselor for a\nhomeless shelter program for thirteen years and is licensed by the state as a substance abuse\ncounselor, was qualified as an expert alcohol and drug abuse counselor. He testified that he had\nevaluated  Applicant in March 2007 and talked to him for \u201ca little over an hour\u201d and concluded that\n5\nApplicant \u201chad no alcohol or drug abuse problems. . . . currently.\u201d  He based his assessment solely\non the amount of drinking that Applicant reported to him and did not review any of his treatment\nrecords.  Applicant told this counselor that he only drank on weekends at social functions. Applicant\n\n6\ndid not report the extent that he was continuing to drink.  Mr. O was aware of Applicant\u2019s previous\ntreatment; however, he did not review those records.  This expert defined problem drinkers as\nincluding only those who are daily drinkers which then affected a job or family. Applicant did not\nmention his current pattern of drinking in March 2007.  He did admit his history of gambling\naddiction, but told the counselor he believed he had it \u201cunder control.\u201d  (TR 13-18; 18-20; 23; 25)\nIn weighing this expert\u2019s views, I give them limited weight as Applicant continues to drink socially\nas he does not believe alcohol is a problem and does not attend AA.  (TR 94; 158)\nReferences\nApplicant\u2019s initial supervisor at the defense contractor (who hired him in November 2005\nand supervised him until August 2006) testified on his behalf.  He reported that Applicant\u2019s work\nwas more than adequate and that he was always on time.  He never observed Applicant show any\nsigns of an alcohol abuse problem or a gambling problem.  He assessed Applicant as a reliable and\ntrustworthy employee. He was not aware of Applicant\u2019s history of gambling and previous alcohol\ntreatment. (TR 60-67; 67-69)\nApplicant\u2019s father, who is a certified public accountant (CPA) and previously worked for a\nfederal agency and is now retired,  testified on his behalf.  He never saw any signs that his son was\nan alcoholic or even a heavy drinker.  He described his son as trustworthy.  (TR 70-75)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or absence\nof any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines:\nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations\n18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline G:  Alcohol Consumption\n21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\n\n     Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n6\n7\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is merely\n6\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government provided substantial evidence that Applicant for bankruptcy in 2002 with\ndebts discharged in 2003, but continue to accumulate substantial debts in part from Applicant and\nhis wife\u2019s addiction to gambling that has contributed to debts accumulated over several years.  While\nhe has attended GA he continues to use credit cards to gable and accumulated substantial additional\ndebts.  While Applicant stated he hopes to stop gambling, he continues to gamble as does his wife\nwhich adversely affects the family finances.  The recently consolidated eleven credit cards to a line\nof credit of $26,000.  He gambled two weeks before the hearing.  His wife gambled the weekend\nbefore the hearing.  In 2007 he had lost an estimated $1,000 through gambling. Consequently,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts), DC, AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and  AG \u00b6 19(i),\n(compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by unsuccessful attempt to stop gambling. . . .\nborrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused\nby gambling) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.  While he and his wife\nhave a good joint income, their credit problems from gambling escalated even since the 2002\nbankruptcy and continue to raise concerns.  Consequently, Applicant has not established a case in\nmitigation.  For example, he provided no evidence under Mitigating Condition (MC) AG \u00b6 20(c),\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Neither was there substantial\nmitigating evidence under AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\n\n       22. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) alcohol-\n7\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.   (b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or\nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment,  regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent. (D) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; (f)\nrelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of  an alcohol rehabilitation program;\n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence.  \n8\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances).   Since, he and his wife continue to gamble on a regular and consistent basis, AG\n\u00b6 20 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  \nWhile to date Applicant has been able to resolve through bankruptcy or by refinancing all\ntheses substantial debts, concern remains over the potential problems from gambling even though\nto his credit Applicant has demonstrated, in part, AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  While he has a professional position\nwith a good income, the continuation of his gambling creates an ongoing security concern.  \nWhole Person Analysis\nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, I\nconclude he is an earnest person who has struggled with reforming the life style issues of his and his\nwife\u2019s ongoing gambling that has contributed to their financial problems.  However, he and his\nspouse both continue to gamble despite the financial impact of those debts. While the 2002\nbankruptcy was a legitimate method of dealing with the financial delinquencies, the ongoing debt\ncreated from their gambling continues to raise security concerns. The potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress is high even though he has a very positive employment history since 2005.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debts and related problems is high. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations.  I rule against  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a.\nthrough 1.f. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s drinking, at times to excess,\nfor over twenty years which continues.  While complying with medical advice that he seek alcohol\ntreatment in 2005, he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse and only completed Phase 1 of the treatment.\nThus, Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within disqualifying conditions (DC) 20 (c) : habitual or binge\n7\n\n       23. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  (a) so much time has passed, or the\n8\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individuals current\u2019 reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement; (b) the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken\nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser); (c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress; (d)\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired after-care requirements, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified  medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.\n9\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,  regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  Also, after being diagnosed with an alcohol\nabuse problem, Applicant  continues to drink even after initial treatment in 2005. He did not\ncompleted all of the recommended after-care therapy and has not attended AA or a similar support\ngroup to maintain sobriety. Thus he falls within DC 20 (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program.  Significantly, Applicant has failed to abstain from alcohol.  \nConsequently, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate these alcohol-related security\nconcerns as he provided insufficient evidence to demonstrate that he falls within mitigating\nconditions.     Under MC 23 (b), even after being diagnosed with alcohol abuse, Applicant despite\n8\nadmitting issues with alcohol abuse,  provided insufficient evidence of his actions to overcome this\nproblem. While his supervisor expressed confidence in him, he failed to establish MC 23 (c), the\nindividual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no\nhistory of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress. He failed to\ndemonstrate significant positive changes in behavior nor to demonstrate sobriety as he does not have\na record of abstinence from alcohol.  \n After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule\nagainst Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c. under SOR Paragraph 2.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1.

Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\n\nSee Directive  \u00b6  E2.A8.1.3.1 (Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 1) (DIMC 1): \u201cThe drug involvement\n2\nwas not recent.\u201d  \nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.A8.1.3.4 (Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition 4) (DIMC 4):  \u201cA demonstrated intent\n3\nnot to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s own testimony further undercuts her efforts to demonstrate a commitment to being drug free.  \u201c[I\n4\ninterpreted the interviewer\u2019s question to be] is it possible that some day in your future you might decide that you want\nto smoke marijuana and so at that point I did say, yes it\u2019s possible, but I can\u2019t imagine ever using it more than one or two\ntimes per year recreationally . . .\u201d  Tr. at 66.  Compare Applicant\u2019s testimony with Government Exhibit 2, a summary\nof the case agent\u2019s interview with Applicant: \u201cAlthough [Applicant\u2019s] future intent is to use marijuana recreationally two\ntimes at most per year, she is not going to use marijuana in the near future because she has to take a drug test and wants\nto pass.\u201d  Compare also the agent\u2019s testimony, in response to Applicant\u2019s question: \u201cQ: Do you remember asking me\nabout my future intent to use marijuana?  A: Yes . . . Q: Do you remember my first response to your question? A: I\n3\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  She took into\naccount such matters as Applicant\u2019s testimony that she has not used marijuana since July 2005  and\n2\nthat her intention is never to use illegal drugs in the future.   On the other hand, we note contrary\n3\nrecord evidence, principally the fact that Applicant\u2019s last admitted use of marijuana occurred after\nshe had submitted her SCA and after she had submitted to a drug test as a condition of employment.\nThe Judge did not discuss these matters in the Conclusions section of her decision.  In the Board\u2019s\nview, this is significant record evidence which undercuts the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion and in all\nreasonableness should have been addressed.  In the first place, given Applicant\u2019s having used\nmarijuana over a period of five years, her use after submitting her SCA undercuts a favorable\napplication of DIMC 1.  Although Judges have leeway in determining what is recent for the purposes\nof mitigating security concerns, that leeway is not without its limits.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-\n09239 at (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006) (\u201cThe Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period\nof reform and rehabilitation.  However, such silence does not mean an Administrative Judge has\nunfettered discretion in deciding what period of time is sufficient . . . [The Judge must conduct] a\nreasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant\u2019s case based on a careful evaluation\nof the totality of the . . . evidence within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d)  See also ISCR Case\nNo. 03-13934 at (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2005) (\u201cApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was recent at the time he\ncompleted the SF-86); ISCR case 02-10454 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004).  In this regard, the\nJudge failed to consider an important aspect of the case.  \nFurthermore, this evidence also qualifies Applicant\u2019s claim that she has demonstrated an\nintent not to use drugs in the future.  As a matter of common sense, one would expect that a person\nwho has taken a drug test as a condition of employment would understand the importance of future\nabstention.  That Applicant used marijuana after such a test raises a substantial question as to\nwhether she has demonstrated a serious intent to obey the law or whether she has refrained from drug\nuse simply in order to qualify for employment.   Again, the Judge\u2019s failure to discuss the timing of\n4\n\nremember your response very well.  Q: What was it?  A: It was, well I suppose I\u2019m not going to because I\u2019ve got to take\na drug test for my job, so I won\u2019t be using it until after that.\u201d  Tr. at 55-56.  \n4\nApplicant\u2019s July 2005 drug use impairs her application of DIMC 4.  While a Judge is presumed to\nhave considered all the evidence, he or she must address \u201csignificant record evidence that a\nreasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2004).  Viewed in light of the record as a whole,\nthe Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions under Guideline H are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nIn light of this holding, we need not address the Guideline E security concerns.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n       This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.   \n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant mitigated security concerns over her drug abuse as her marijuana use was not\nrecent and ended in July 2005 with no intent for future use. Overall Applicant demonstrated good\nconduct in disclosing fully her prior marijuana use in her 2005 security clearance application.  While\nthe Government raised concerns over her troublesome conduct in her 2006 interview, she\ncooperating for the majority of the two-hour interview and voluntarily disclosed significant adverse\ninformation about her use of marijuana and her subsequent use in July 2005.  When the investigator\nraised new questions at the end, I conclude Applicant misunderstood and did not terminate the\ninterview.  Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on August 28, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.   The SOR alleges specific concerns over drug abuse\n1\n(Guideline H).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on September\n13, 2006, where she requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on November 2, 2006, prepared a Ready to Proceed Memorandum and\non November 7, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  On November 14, 2006, a Notice of Hearing\nset the date for hearing on December 6, 2006. Because of a change in schedule, an Amended Notice\nof Hearing, issued November 30, 2006, moved the hearing to December 4, 2006, at a location near\nwhere Applicant works and lives.  Applicant agreed she had sufficient notice to proceed on that date.\n(TR 8-9)\nThe Government called one witness, an investigator for the U.S. Investigation Services\n(USIS), a contractor for OPM. (TR 25-62)  He also offered two exhibits which were admitted into\nevidence without objection. (Exhibits 1-2; TR 19-20, 46) The Government also offered five\ndocuments for Administrative/Official Notice; Exhibits I and V were accepted for Administrative\nNotice.  Applicant objected to the relevance of Exhibits II, III, and IV as she had never been arrested;\nthose documents were not accepted for Administrative Notice.  (AN I-V; TR 20-25; 62-63; 106-107)\nApplicant testified.  With the Government\u2019s agreement, at the hearing I granted her seven\nadditional days until December 11, 2006, to submit supplemental evidence.  The Government was\ngiven a week to review the documents by December 18, 2006. (TR 76-77; 109)  Subsequently, on\nDecember 5, 2006, she submitted Exhibits A, B, C, D.  \nOn December 8, 2006, Department Counsel objected to exhibit B, an evaluation, because it\nwas unsigned and Exhibit C, a reference letter, because it was unsigned.  He had no objection to\n\n       Although Exhibit B, her summer intern evaluation was unsigned, and Exhibit C, a recommendation for\n2\nthe MBA program was unsigned, I admitted them because Applicant reported that the signed copies of these\ndocuments were unavailable and because the evaluation was submitted on a corporate form which was an\nindicia of reliability.  Further,  the unsigned documents were consistent in tone with the commendations in\nExhibit D, where the Government had no objection.\n       Department Counsel did not address if this Motion to Amend the SOR was under the old Directive or\n3\nthe new guidelines that went into effect at DOHA, September 1, 2007.  \n       On November 8, 2006, Applicant replied to the Amended SOR and denied paragraph 2.a.; she stated,\n4\n\u201cI have never been dishonest at any point during this application process. I provided many details about my\nmarijuana use, including the names of people I smoked marijuana with as well as who provided the marijuana\nwhen I could recall them.  Late in the interview, after supplying many names and repeating my answers many\ntimes, I asked the investigator some questions about why she needed to know these individuals\u2019 names.\nWhen she was unable to explain it to me, I calmly replied that I didn\u2019t wish to give any more names.  I don\u2019t\nbelieve I was uncooperative.\n\u201cIn response to the final sentence of \u2018a\u2019 above, the investigator terminated the interview.  As I recall,\nwe were waling away from the table when I asked her a final question about why they wanted to know so\nmuch about my marijuana use when they didn\u2019t question me about any other illegal behavior.  As an\nexample, I stated underage alcohol consumption.  The investigator then asked me if I had used alcohol when\nI was underage, and she began to it sit back down as if to question me again.  I replied honestly \u201cyes\u201d but did\nnot sit down to restart the interview.  It was my understanding that she had asked me all of the questions she\nintended to ask me, and that the interview had ended.\u201d  (Answer to Amended SOR of November 8, 2006)\n3\nExhibit D.  Subsequently, I overruled his objections and admitted  all those exhibits; and the record\n2\nclosed on December 8, 2006. The transcript (TR) was received on November 28, 2006.\nMotion to Amend the SOR\nOn October 31, 2006, Department Counsel moved to Amend the Statement of Reasons by\nadding a new allegation raising security concerns over Applicant\u2019s personal conduct (Guideline E)\nand alleged Applicant \u201cfailed to cooperate with an authorized investigator for the U.S. Office of\nPersonnel Management\u201d (OPM) on or about February 7, 2006, when she \u201cdeclined to answer further\nquestions\u201d about her marijuana use and her underage alcohol use, and \u201cterminated the interview.\u201d3\nOn November 8, 2006, Applicant responded and denied the allegation  and provided additional\n4\nexplanation.  Department Counsel provided a copy of the Amended SOR and her Ansser on\nNovember 15, 2007\nAt the hearing Applicant objected to the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR.  The\nDepartment Counsel asserted the right to Amend the SOR under paragraphs 10 and 13 of the\nDirective and argued he gave the Application sufficient time to respond to the motion, and she did\nrespond. (TR 9-15; 16-17; 64)  After the Applicant and the investigator completed their testimony,\nI accepted the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR over the objection of the Applicant who\ndenied the allegation.  (TR 80)\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\n\n4\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 22 years old, has worked for  Employer #1 in State #1 as a software engineer\ninitially as an intern in summer 2005 from May to August 2005.  She completed a SF-86 security\nclearance application in March 2005 before her summer internship, but she learned she was not\ngranted an interim secret as she had admitted marijuana use.  Applicant received an outstanding\nrating from her summer internship as her work was assessed as exemplary.  She was evaluated as\nan outstanding team player, with excellent communication skills and outstanding technical skills.\nShe was seen as having good interpersonal skills and a very good work ethic.  Subsequently, she was\noffered a permanent job at the end of the summer.  She has been a full-time employee from June\n2006 to present. (Exhibit 1; Exhibits A, B, D; TR 75; 78; 80-81)\nShortly after she began her full-time employment, her supervisor provided a recommendation\nfor graduate school where he commended her work.  He stated he had so much confidence in her that\nhe asked her to present a system design to an end-user audience even though new engineers usually\ndo not make such presentations.  (Exhibit C) In her short tenure, she was been recognized for her\n\u201cexceptional performance\u201d by \u201cpride\u201d certificates on five different occasions.  (Exhibit D)\nApplicant graduated from college in State #2 in May 2006.  She is single, but is in a long-\nterm relationship. (Exhibit 1; TR 76; 81)  She is active in a community organization and mentors an\neight year old girl.  (TR 75) She was recently accepted into an Masters of Business Administration\n(MBA) university program and was to start classes in January 2007.  (TR 105; Exhibits A, C)\nDrugs and Personal Conduct\nOn her March 2005 Security Clearance Application (SF 86) Applicant voluntarily disclosed\nher use of marijuana twenty times from April 2000 to February 2005. She testified she used drugs\nin high school about 20 times and only used marijuana a few times in college.  (Exhibit 1; TR 86-87)\nShe disclosed her drug use on the SF 86 as she wanted to be 100% honest.  (TR 104)  Applicant\ntestified took a drug test for her internship in February or March 2005 and passed it.  (TR 84; 103)\nThe security interview in February 2006 had  elements that the investigator and the Applicant\nviewed differently.  Although she did not provide her notes, the contract investigator from U.S.I.S.\nauthenticated her interview summary of the Personal Subject Interview (ROI).  (Exhibit 2) Under\nOPM practice contract investigators do not take signed, sworn statements, so Applicant did not have\nan opportunity to review the the accuracy of the ROI before it was submitted.  While the Applicant\nagreed to the admissibility of the ROI, she contested the accuracy of several of the statements\nreported in the ROI.   (Exhibit 2; TR 61-62)   \nApplicant cooperated for the majority of the interview and provided significant adverse\ninformation about her drug use.  Applicant admitted to the investigator that she used marijuana\nbetween 2000 and July 2005, but she has not used marijuana since then and has no intent for future\nuse. (Answer; TR 74)   The investigator remembered that the interview was lengthy as she followed\nprocedures that required her to ask the Applicant O.P.M.\u2019s \u201c17 Guideline question\u201dabout each time\nApplicant had used drugs.  Her objective was to resolve the issue of the drug use Applicant had\npreviously disclosed in her SF 86.  The investigator conceded that this repetition can seem \u201cendless.\u201d\n\n       Applicant conceded that the investigator\u2019s technique of asking the same 17 questions about each of the\n5\ntimes she used marijuana was annoying as her answer was the same for each time she used.  (TR 100-101)\n     Applicant helped to found the local chapter of NORML when she was a sophomore in college.  Her\n6\nunderstanding was that NORML never advocated the illegal use of marijuana, simply that the laws be\nchanged.  (TR 88-90)\n       Applicant objected to the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s summary statement in the ROI which  reported\n7\nthat \u201cSubject intends to smoke marijuana one or two times per year recreationally.\u201d  She conceded that when\nasked about future use of marijuana she did say, \u201cyes, it\u2019s possible, but I can\u2019t imagine ever using it more\nthan one or two times per year recreationally.\u201d  (Exhibit 2; TR 66) \n5\nBoth the investigator and the Applicant agreed that the Applicant showed she was \u201cannoyed\u201d  with\n5\nthe investigator repeating the same 17 questions over each and every use of marijuana in high school\nand in college.  The investigator testified that Applicant did volunteer in the interview her July 2005\nmarijuana use and also volunteered that she was the college campus president  of the National\n6\nOrganization for the Reform of Marijuana (NORML) whose goal was to bring awareness to the\nlegalization of marijuana.   In her efforts to be honest Applicantdisclosed she was the campus\npresident of NORML; however, she did not state she was in favor of the legalization of marijuana.\nAlthough Applicant used marijuana again in July 2005, she has not used marijuana since then and\nhas no intent for future use.  (Answer; TR 67-73; 82-84; 92; 102-103)  Applicant was never arrested\nfor her drug use.  (TR 92)  None of her current friends use marijuana. (TR 76)   \nApplicant explained that the investigator repeatedly asked her about her future intent  to use\n7\nmarijuana.  However, Applicant disputed the accuracy of the report in the ROI.  Applicant further\nclarified in her testimony that she did not then and does not now have any intention to use marijuana\nin the future.  She has no intention of using marijuana again.  (TR 66-67) While she was involved\nwith NORML as a sophomore in college, she is no longer active in NORML.  (TR 77-8) (SOR 1.a,\n1.b, and 2.a.)  \nHalf-way through the interview, the investigator stated that Applicant refused to disclose who\nwas smoking marijuana with her in college at the state university.  (TR 33, 35-36, 39-44) In\nApplicant\u2019s view since she and the investigator were in a public setting, not in a private room, she\nwas reluctant to reveal the name of her friend as she was \u201cunsure about legal consequences for\nhim\u201das she wanted to protect his rights and the investigator could not tell her why she needed the\nnames.  (TR 93-97)  She did reveal the name of her college friend at the hearing as she then had a\nbetter understanding of the importance of giving all the information requested.  She explained it was\nthe lack of privacy in the interview room that led her to decline to reveal the name.  (TR 99-100) \nThe investigator\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s views differed on how the interview ended.  While the\ninvestigator did not recall how long the interview took, she remembered Applicant made an\nadmission about underage alcohol use.  When investigator then began to ask Applicant a series of\nquestions about her alcohol use, Applicant left and \u201cwalked out\u201d of the interview.  (TR 47-58; 59-60)\nThe Report of Investigation (ROI) concluded, \u201cSubject refused to answer any further questions\nregarding alcohol use or any further questions regarding marijuana use.\u201d  (Exhibit 2)\nOn the other hand, Applicant remember the sequence of events differently. Applicant\nremembered the interview took approximately two hours.  She viewed the interview as over when\n\n       On cross-examination she conceded that she did not allow the investigator to \u201crestart the interview\u201d\n8\nbased on her mention of having used alcohol when she was underaged.  (TR 98-99)\n6\nshe asked the interviewer why the focus had been on illegal drug use and not underage alcohol use.\nShe believed that the investigator then \u201cattempted to restart the interview.\u201d (TR 74)  Applicant\nexplained she provided the names of all of her high school friends, but she did not provide any\nnames of college friends who used marijuana to the investigator as she was unsure of potential legal\nconsequences for them.  She subsequently provided the name of one college friend at the hearing to\ndemonstrate her willingness to cooperate.  Applicant established that she was otherwise cooperative\nin providing relevant and material details.  She admitted using marijuana in July 2005 after she\nsubmitted her SF 86.  Applicant also challenged the accuracy of the ROI report which stated that the\nonly reason for her not using marijuana was to pass a drug test.  Applicant reported that was not her\nmotivation as she had already passed a drug test before she began the internship with a defense\ncontractor in summer 2005.  At the time of the interview in February 2006 she was not planning to\ntake a drug test and had no intent to use marijuana again.  Applicant recalled the investigator put\ndown her notebook and pen and, consequently, Applicant believed that the interview had ended.  She\ndid not understand that her mention of her underage use of alcohol would open up a new line  of\n8\ninvestigative inquiry.  Also, Applicant remembered being in a room with other people so she\nbelieved she did not have complete privacy in the interview.  (TR 67-73; 77; 82; 97-98; 99-102)  \nThus, her failure to provide additional details about her underage drinking and her refusal to\nname a college friend in the interview do not clearly establish that Applicant failed to cooperate with\nan authorized investigator of OPM as alleged.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or\nabsence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the\nevidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nE.2.A.8.1.1. The Concern:  Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions\nregarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse\nor dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nE2.A5.1.1.  The Concern:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncould indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n\n       E2.A8.1.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: E2.A8.1.1.3.1.The drug\n9\ninvolvement was not recent; E2.A8.1.1.3.2.  The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event;\nE2.A8.1.1.3.3.  A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;  E2.A8.1.1.3.4.  Satisfactory\ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional.\n7\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nin order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\n \nCONCLUSIONS\n Guideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe Government established security concerns over her marijuana use in high school and\ncollege from 2000 to 2005 as well as security concerns over her decision to use marijuana again\nwhile she was an intern at a defense contractor in July 2005.  As she had disclosed her high school\nand college drug use on her SF 86, she learned she was not granted an interim clearance as an intern.\nDrug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information.  Her actions fall within conditions that could raise\na security concern and may be disqualifying including:  E2.A8.1.1.2.1.  (any drug abuse).   (SOR\n1.a.)  However,  there was no evidence of any marijuana use since July 2005, no evidence of current\ndrug use, or persuasive evidence of her intent for future use.  Thus, the government failed to establish\nthat she falls within the provisions of 10 U.S.C. Section 986, which would disqualify a current drug\nuser for being granted a security clearance.  (SOR 1.b., 1.c.)  Her disclosure to the investigator she\nplayed a leadership role on her campus for NORML, an organization that questions the current drug\nlaws, was not even alleged as a security concern in the SOR.  Notably, her involvement was limited\nto her sophomore year in college, and she subsequently ended her involvement.  Thus, that past\ninvolvement in college does not lessen her credibility in the current context.   \nApplicant mitigated  security concerns over her prior use of marijuana as there is no evidence\n9\nof recent use as she did not use drugs subsequent to July 2005.   Thus, E2.A8.1.1.3.1. (The drug\ninvolvement was not recent.) applies.  Further, Applicant credibly established that her  intent is not\nto use any drugs in the future.  Although exactly what she said to the investigator in February 2006\nabout her future intent is disputed, she credibly established that her current intent falls within MC\n3:  E2.A8.1.1.3.3.  A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.  I conclude that she\nprovide sufficient evidence in mitigation especially when viewing her in the context of a \u201cwhole\nperson.\u201d  She had an outstanding evaluation from her work as a summer intern which led to a\npermanent job offer.  Her current supervisor demonstrated his confidence in her by his outstanding\n\n8\nrecommendation of her to an MBA program where she was admitted.  In addition, in her short tenure\nshe has received five \u201cpride\u201d commendations for the quality of her work performance.  She has\nmatured and demonstrated her commitment to a drug-free lifestyle.  Hence, after considering the\nAdjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under\nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b. and 1.c. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 1.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Government raised security concerns over Applicant\u2019s Personal Conduct based on the\nimportance of the fiduciary relationship the Government has with Applicant over the issue of access\nto classified information as the government has to rely on individuals to follow the rules.  The\nGovernment alleged that Applicant \u201cfailed to cooperate\u201d with the security clearance investigator for\nOPM when she was asked to provide\u201dcertain details\u201d about her marijuana use between August 2002\nand July 2005, including names of people with whom she smoked marijuana and the name of the\nperson her provided her marijuana.  Further, they alleged Applicant \u201cultimately declined to answer\nfurther questions\u201d about her marijuana use and underage alcohol use, and terminated the interview.\nThe government asserts that consequently her conduct fall within disqualifying condition 2:\nE2.A5.1.2.2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities and also that her\nconduct fell within Disqualifying Condition (DC) (5):  E2.A5.1.2.5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations.  While the Government amended the SOR to add this concern as a new allegation,\nApplicant denied the allegation.  Certainly, the investigator who testified painted a bleak picture of\nthe interview.  However, Applicant disputed her conclusions in the ROI which she had not been\ngiven the opportunity to view.  Applicant was not given an opportunity to provide a signed, sworn\nstatement.  \nIndeed, in assessing her overall, I find it significant that Applicant voluntarily disclosed her\nuse of marijuana twenty times from April 2000 to April 2005 on her March 2005 initial SF 86 as he\nwanted to be 100% honest.   She also disclosed subsequent use of marijuana in July 2005 to the\ninvestigator and cooperated throughout the majority of the interview.\nThus, her failure to provide additional information to the investigator was over limited and\nminor issues.  Notably, her underage drinking and her refusal to name a college friend in the\ninterview were not alleged as security concerns.  Thus, I do not conclude that her omission of this\ninformation was equivalent to her refusal to disclose relevant and material information to the\ninvestigator.  Also, I note that Applicant disputed much of the investigator\u2019s testimony and the\naccuracy of the ROI which Applicant had not been allowed to review before it was submitted to\nOPM\nSignificantly, Applicant fully disclosed all of her high school and college marijuana use on\nher SF 86, volunteered to the investigator her subsequent use of marijuana  in July 2005, and also\ndisclosed her college political involvement in NORML.  Overall Applicant demonstrated her intent\nto comply with security requirements.  She fully disclosed her high school use and the friends with\nwhom she used.  While Applicant may have shown annoyance at the repetition of the questions,\nrefused to disclose one college friend with whom she used marijuana, and did not expand on  her\n\n       In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following\n10\nfactors: E.2.21.1.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; E2.2.1.2. The circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; E2.2.1.3.  The frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; E2.2.1.4.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; E2.2.1.5.  The\nvoluntariness of the participation; E2.2.1.6.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; E.2.2.1.7.  The motivation for the conduct; E.2.2.1.8.  The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and E.2.2.1.9.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (E.2.2.\nAdjudication Process)\n9\nunderage drinking, these limited refusals do not amount to a failure to cooperate in the interview or\na \u201cdeliberate\u201d omission or concealment of relevant and material facts.  In sum, the Government\nfailed to establish a prima facie case of her demonstrated intent to falsify based on the ROI and agent\ntestimony.  Had a sworn statement been taken at the time of the interview, Applicant would have\nbeen allowed to review and to correct any misunderstandings.  \nTo the extent that the adverse impression Applicant made on the investigator casts a shadow\non Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, I conclude that overall there is evidence of rehabilitation, positive\nbehavior changes, and improved circumstances.  Looking at Applicant as a whole person  and\n10\nconsidering the circumstances surrounding her conduct (E2.2.1.2), I resolve that Applicant provided\nsufficient evidence of good personal conduct based both on her disclosures in the SF 86 and on the\nsignificant adverse admissions over her drug use she volunteered in the interview. Further, I note\nunder, E2.2.1.4.. Applicant\u2019s young age at the time of the interview.  Also in assessing under\nE.2.2.1.7. , the motivation for the conduct, I conclude that overall Applicant\u2019s substantial disclosures\nlead me to conclude there was miscommunication between her and the investigator, not an intent to\nwithhold relevant and material information. Now that she is out of college and understands more\nfully the importance of the security clearance, she has demonstrated enhanced maturity and growth\nboth on the job as confirmed by her favorable evaluation as an intern, by her supervisor\u2019s letter of\nreference to an MBA program,  by her many commendations on the job, and by her conduct at the\nhearing where she made additional admissions and showed her willingness to cooperate fully. \nThus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines,\nI rule for Applicant under SOR Paragraph 2 under subparagraph 2.a.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has a history of minor offenses between 1980 and 2004, but demonstrated rehabilitation\nthrough his successful completion of probation, the family building classes, job training for a second\ncareer, and his long-term record of employment.  Applicant also incurred delinquent debt after his\ndivorce in 1994 and a devastating fire in 2005.  He resolved the largest listed obligations; his unpaid\ndebts total less than $3,500.00, so that the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\nis low.  Considering Applicant\u2019s maturity, personal circumstances, and rehabilitative progress, the\nlikelihood of a continuation or recurrence of criminal conduct or significant financial problems is\nlow.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 14, 2005, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), to apply for renewal of his security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) declined to continue a security clearance for Applicant under Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992), (the \u201cDirective\u201d), as amended by the new administrative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and implemented for the Department of Defense on September\n1, 2006.  On September 22, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\nfor its decision: security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing by letter dated November 15, 2006.  He elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was originally assigned to another judge, but was reassigned to me on March 9,\n2007.  With the concurrence of Applicant and Department Counsel, I convened the hearing on March\n29, 2007.  The government introduced Exhibits 1 through 7.  Applicant provided Exhibits A through\nJ and testified on his own behalf.  At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open until April 12, 2007,\nfor him to submit additional materials.  I later granted an additional delay until April 19, 2007.\nApplicant submitted documents admitted as Exhibits K and L, without objection.  DOHA received\nthe final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 11, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his Answer to the SOR dated November 15, 2006, Applicant admitted the allegations in\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, and \u00b6 2.b, and he denied the remaining allegations in the SOR.  After a complete\nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant was born in December 1957.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  After high school, he attended a\ntechnical school for aeronautics for three years.  (Tr. at 17.)  \nIn June 1978, he began working as a laboratory technician for a major defense contractor.\n(Tr. at 17.)  His department installs and maintains flight test equipment for military aircraft built by\nhis corporation.  (Tr. at 31.)  He first received a security clearance in 1979.  (Tr. at 31.)  \n\n3\nApplicant and his girlfriend had a child in 1975.  (Ex. 1 at 15.)  They married in August 1978.\n(Ex. 1 at 12.)  Applicant and his wife had three more children between about 1983 and 1985.\nIn February 1980, Applicant solicited a woman he believed to be a prostitute.  (Tr. at 32-33.)\nIn fact, she was an undercover police officer engaged in a \u201csting\u201d operation.  Applicant pled guilty\nto the charge of Patronizing Prostitution, and the court sentenced him to probation for six months.\n(Tr. at 33; SOR, \u00b6 1.b.)  He successfully completed the probation.  (Tr. at 76.)  Applicant denies\nengaging in such behavior before or since the incident.  (Tr. at 33-34.) \nIn 1982, Applicant had a daughter with a woman who was not his wife.  (Tr. at 54.)  She\nbrought a lawsuit and the state court ordered Applicant to pay her child support through the court.\n(Ex. I.)  Applicant testified he was never delinquent in the payment of his child support obligation.\n(Tr. at 53; Ex. I.)  \nIn November 1991, Applicant and his wife were involved in an argument over the car keys.\n(Tr. at 35; Ex. 6.)  In a sworn statement dated September 9, 1993, Applicant wrote that he and his\nwife were arguing, and when the police arrived he was in the front yard holding his wife by the wrist;\nhe was then arrested.  (Ex. 6 at 1; SOR, \u00b6 1.b.)  Applicant asserted the matter was later dropped\u2013he\nnever appeared in court for any criminal charges arising out of the incident.  (Ex. 6 at 1.)  His wife\nobtained an Order of Protection in December 1991, preventing Applicant from contacting her or\nentering her home.  (Tr. at 36; SOR, \u00b6 1.c.)  After the order expired, Applicant returned to the\nhousehold, where he lived until moving out permanently in late 1993.  (Tr. at 77-78.)  Applicant\u2019s\nwife obtained another Order of Protection in November 1993\u2013Applicant denies any other incident\nprompting the second protection order.  (Tr. at 35, 77-78.) \nApplicant divorced his wife in 1994.  (Tr. at 17.)  As part of the divorce proceedings, the\nstate court ordered him to assume certain marital debts, and pay spousal support and child support\nto his ex-wife.  (Tr. at 55; Ex. 7 at 2.)  The terms of the divorce left Applicant unable to meet his\nfinancial obligations.  Between about October 1994 and January 1995, after all deductions and\nrequired payments, his net weekly salary was $84.00.  (Ex. 7 at 2.)  As a result, he became delinquent\non many ordinary financial obligations.  \nApplicant opened a credit card account with a $300.00 limit.  (Tr. at 58; SOR, \u00b6 2.g.)  When\nhe fell behind on his payments, the credit card company imposed fees and interest charges that ran\nthe total debt over $1,700.00.  (Tr. at 58-59.)  \nIn about 1997, another defense contractor purchased Applicant\u2019s company.  Applicant\ncontinued to work for the new company in the same capacity.  (Tr. at 17.)  As Applicant\u2019s earnings\nincreased, his ability to pay his debts improved.  Also, as his children became emancipated, his child\nsupport obligation decreased.\nIn March 2001, after having a couple drinks with dinner at home, Applicant decided to go\nout for a few more drinks.  (Tr. at 36.)  While driving home, a police officer stopped him for\nspeeding.  (Tr. at 36.)  The officer took Applicant to the police station, where a Breathalyzer test\nindicated his blood-alcohol content was .09%, a level creating a presumption of intoxication under\nstate law.  (Tr. at 37-38.)  The state charged him with Driving While Intoxicated, and Applicant did\nnot contest the charge.   The court sentenced him to 30 days in confinement (suspended), a $500.00\n\n4\nfine, and probation for two years.  As a condition of his probation, Applicant attended an alcohol and\ndrug safety awareness course, three hours a day, two times per week for six weeks.  (Tr. at 39.)  The\ncourt also ordered Probation Before Judgment, so that if Applicant successfully completed his\nprobation, the charge would be dropped.  (Tr. at 38.)  Applicant complied with the requirements of\nthe probation.  He testified that he has not had any alcohol-related incidents since that time.  (Tr. at\n41.)  \nIn about May of 2002, Applicant ended his relationship with a girlfriend who had lived with\nhim for about five years.  (Tr. at 41.)  She claimed he had some of her family photographs.  (Tr. at\n42.)  According to Applicant, they had a tug-of-war over some personal property.  (Tr. at 81.)  She\nreported to police that Applicant assaulted her.  The court put the charge on the Stet docket.\nApplicant was never found guilty of any offense or sentenced to any punishment arising from the\ncharges, nor was it considered to be a violation of his probation.  (Tr. at 43, 80.)  \nIn about 2002, the daughter born to Applicant out of wedlock became emancipated, and his\nobligation to pay child support ended.  (Tr. at 55.)  By mistake, the state took some of the funds still\nbeing paid to his ex-wife and gave them to the mother of his newly-emancipated child for about six\nmonths.  (Tr. at 55.)  This resulted in an overpayment on behalf of his emancipated child and an\narrearage in payments to his ex-wife.  (Tr. at 56.)  It took two years to correct the error.  (Tr. at 56.)\nApplicant got a judgment from the state court indicating he did not owe an arrearage because of the\nmisdirected payments.  (Ex. E.) \nApplicant lived with his fianc\u00e9 and her son for about four and one-half years.  (Tr. at 19.)\nHis fiance\u2019s son had emotional and behavioral problems; Social Services is involved with his case,\nand the local police have been called several times for his assaults on his mother.  (Id.; Ex. B; Ex.\nC; Ex. G.)  \nIn March 2004, when the young man was 11 years old, he and his mother got into an\nargument about his poor school performance, and particularly about his failure to bring books home\nto do his homework.  (Tr. at 44.)  She called Applicant at work and told him about the problem; he\nsaid he would take care of it when he got home.  (Id.)  Applicant met the young man while he was\nreturning to school for his books and spoke to him about being disrespectful toward his mother.\nAccording to Applicant, the young man began walking away from him; Applicant pulled him back\nand struck him three times with the back of his hand against the back and side of his head.  (Tr. at\n46.)  \nThe young man later told his grandmother, who called the police.  (Tr. at 47-48.)  Authorities\ncharged Applicant with: (1) Child Abuse, Custodian, and (2) Assault, 2d degree.  The state court\ndismissed the first charge at trial.  (Ex. D.)  Applicant pleaded guilty to the assault offense, and the\ncourt sentenced him to two years probation.  (Tr. at 48.)  As a condition of his probation, Applicant\nattended family building classes.  (Id.)  He successfully completed the probation.\nOn September 30, 2005, Applicant suffered a fire that destroyed his home.  (Tr. at 74.)  His\ngrandmother perished in the fire.  (Id.)  Applicant also lost all his personal possessions in the fire.\n(Tr. at 74.)  He had no insurance, and no means to pay for his grandmother\u2019s funeral or to replace\nhis possessions.  (Tr. at 82, 83.)  \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s grandmother lived with him for a few years, and he served as her guardian with\nauthority to cash her Social Security checks.  (Tr. at 21, 62.)  After she passed away in September\n2005, her Social Security checks continued to arrive.  (Tr. at 64.)  Applicant cashed one check to\nhelp with her interment, but never cashed the remaining checks.  (Tr. at 21, 64, 66.)  In February\n2006, the Social Security Administration (SSA) placed the account for collection.  (Ex. A; SOR, \u00b6\n2.i.)  He reimbursed the SSA for the cashed check, and in August 2006, he mailed the checks back\nto the SSA which issued statements acknowledging receipt of the checks.  (Ex. A at 2-6; Tr. at 64.)\nThe SSA acknowledged that Applicant repaid all the overpaid benefits.  (Ex. K.) \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP, he reported several delinquent financial obligations.\nHe has paid off several accounts that were formerly delinquent.  (SOR, \u00b6 2.e; Tr. at 56; Ex. F.)  He\nreceived bills for medical services (SOR, \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b) he could not identify; Applicant believes at\nleast one of the charges was for medical services for his grandmother, for whom he served as\nguardian.  (Tr. at 51.)  He has not sought or received financial counseling.  (Tr. at 82.)  After the\nhearing, he negotiated settlement agreements with two creditors, however there is no evidence he\nhas begun making payments on these accounts.  (Ex.

(Tr. at 86.) \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988).)  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified\ninformation within the executive branch.  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 2(a).)  An\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  (Id.)  An administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness\nof participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).)  \u201cAny\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.) \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, as set forth in the new adjudicative guidelines promulgated\nby the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well\nas those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set\nforth and discussed in the conclusions below.  I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the\nlegal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the\nSOR.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern relating to\ncriminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security concerns.\nParagraph 31(a) provides that \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d may be\ndisqualifying.  Similarly, under \u00b6 31(c), an \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless\nof whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d may raise security\nconcerns.  The evidence demonstrates multiple lesser offenses, including soliciting prostitution in\n1980, a minor assault in November 1991, driving while intoxicated in March 2001, and a minor\nassault in March 2004.  The available evidence is insufficient to show criminal conduct related to\nthe incident on May 21, 2002; even though Applicant admitted he received a summons for the\nassault charge, he does not admit\u2013and the evidence does not establish\u2013any criminal conviction or\nconduct.  Nonetheless, the remaining evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions. \nThe adjudicative guidelines also set out some potentially mitigating conditions.  Under \u00b6\n32(a), it may be mitigating where \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\nupon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Some of the offenses in this\ncase are very old, including the conviction in 1980, the assault in 1991, and the DWI conviction in\n2001.  However, consideration is not limited to the dates of the individual offenses; one must also\nconsider the pattern of the misconduct, which covers a period of 24 years.  This pattern may suggest\na lack of judgment or self-control in stressful situations.  Some of the offenses, particularly the\nsolicitation of prostitution and the DWI, appear to be unique offenses that are unlikely to recur.  On\nthe other hand, the offenses related to domestic violence may not be \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d\nI conclude this potentially mitigating condition applies only in part.   \nParagraph 32(d) indicates it may be mitigating where \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\n\n8\nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\u201d  The most recent offense occurred in March 2004\u2013over three\nyears ago.  Since then, Applicant successfully completed the probationary period, took family\nbuilding classes, expressed his remorse, obtained his real estate license for a second career, and\ncontinued to work for his long-time employer.  I conclude the evidence raises this potentially\nmitigating factor.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out in \u00b6 18\nof the new adjudicative guidelines.  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under \u00b6 19(a), an\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under  \u00b6 19(c),\n\u201ca history of nor meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns.  The evidence shows\nApplicant has a long history of being unable to pay his debts since his divorce in 1994.  The evidence\nraises these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised\nunder this guideline.  Paragraph 20(a) may apply where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Some debts were quite\nold, but the unpaid obligations listed in the SOR were fairly recent.  Moreover, there were many\noverdue accounts over many years; therefore the conduct was not infrequent.  The available evidence\ndoes not raise this mitigating condition.\nUnder \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose because of his divorce,\nand the resulting burden of marital debt, spousal support, and child support for four children.  More\nrecently, the total loss of all his household possessions due to fire exacerbated his financial problems.\nI find this mitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d is potentially mitigating\nunder \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant has not sought or obtained financial counseling; therefore, this is not a\nfactor for consideration. \nParagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Applicant resolved two of the three largest\n\n9\ndebts listed on the SOR; he demonstrated that the debt for unpaid child support was based on a\nmistake by the county, and that he resolved the claim of the SSA by returning the uncashed checks,\nand reimbursing them for the one check used to cover funeral expenses.  He also paid one\noutstanding medical bill.  (Ex. F.)  On the other hand, one credit card account (with exorbitant fees\nand penalties) remains unresolved, and Applicant has failed to investigate or resolve several small\nmedical bills.  I conclude this factor applies in part.\nUnder \u00b6 20(e), even where there is some evidence indicating a delinquent debt, an individual\nmay alleviate security concerns where there is evidence that,\nthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nMost of the unpaid debts are medical bills.  Applicant testified that his medical care is covered by\ninsurance, except for a small co-pay amount that is paid at the time of treatment, leading him to\nquestion the validity of several of the debts.  At the time of the hearing, however, Applicant did not\nprovide documentation to substantiate the basis for the dispute, or to show that he has challenged\nthe debt.  The available evidence does not raise this factor.\nThe \u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept\nI carefully considered all the facts and circumstances, including the potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions, in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201dconcept.  As noted above, Applicant has a\nhistory of criminal offenses.  Each offense was fairly minor, however.  (AG, \u00b6 2(a)(1).)  While there\nhave been several incidents over the last 27 years, they were not \u201cfrequent\u201d crimes, nor was last\noffense recent.  (AG, \u00b6 2(a)(3).)  He has demonstrated rehabilitation, through his successful\ncompletion of probation, the family building classes, his expression of remorse, obtaining his real\nestate license for a second career, and his long-term record of employment.  (AG, \u00b6 2(a)(6).)  The\nnature of the offenses were such that they generate little or no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.  (AG, \u00b6 2(a)(7).)  Furthermore, considering Applicant\u2019s maturity, personal\ncircumstances, and rehabilitative progress, the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of criminal\nconduct is quite low.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances also invite closer scrutiny.  The problems arose due to\nhis divorce and, to a lesser extent, the devastating fire in 2005, therefore the accumulation of these\ndebts does not reflect on his reliability, dependability, or judgment.  Two of the largest debts listed\nin the SOR\u2013the child support arrearage and the social security overpayment\u2013were resolved prior to\nthe commencement of this action.  Presently, the unpaid debts total less than $3,500.00, so that the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant\u2019s personal finances are just\nat the point of dramatic improvement; that by itself does not prove he will use his new liquidity to\nsatisfy his debts, but it is evidence that he will be able to do so, should he so choose.  I also\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s 29 years of service to defense contractors, and that he has held a security\nclearance since 1979.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nhistory of criminal conduct and his financial circumstances.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n10\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.k:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Dyer, Jr., Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 31, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\n2\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn August 23, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s whole person\nanalysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\n Whether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1996. \nHe has held a security clearance since 1999 when he was first employed by a defense contractor.\nApplicant\u2019s parents live in Syria in a suburb of Damascus where his father operates a small\nelectronics repair shop.  His mother is a homemaker who has not been in good health.  Both parents\nare in their mid-70s and have no connection with the government.  He telephones his parents once\na month, especially because of the health of his mother. \nApplicant has one brother and two sisters who live in Syria.  His brother is a truck driver,\nwho also served a required tour in the military as a young man.  Applicant was sponsoring the sisters\nfor citizenship in the U.S. but one recently married and is no longer interested in coming to the U.S.\nHe continues to sponsor the second sister who is a manager for a small business importing building\nmaterials from Germany.  Applicant contacts his siblings by phone 3-4 times a year.  The young\nchildren of his siblings in Syria attend private schools of an internationally renowned private system.\nNone of the family in Syria have any contacts or work with the Syrian government.  Applicant has\na brother who lives in the U.S. and is also employed as an engineer with another major defense\ncontractor.  Applicant maintains close contact with him.  He is the only relative who knows what\nApplicant does and for whom he works.  They do not discuss their own or the other\u2019s work with\nother family members.  \nApplicant has traveled to Syria five times since 1997, when he first took his wife to meet his\nfamily.  His other trips were in 2000 so that his older child could meet his parents and in 2001 for\na family wedding.  This trip was encouraged by his colleagues since he had recently begun work for\nhis present employer, was working hard, and they thought he needed a vacation.  The trips in 2004\nand 2005 were related to the illness of his mother.  The last two trips were taken alone for cost\nreasons.  Applicant has always used his U.S. passport for travel to Syria.  He has notified his security\noffice of all of his trips since his employment in the defense industry even though company policy\ndid not fully require it.  He was not required to give a report on his return and did not do so.  He\nknows to report suspicious contacts to the relevant security office.  \nBecause of current security implications, Applicant does not intend to return to Syria even\nthough he has continuing concerns for his mother.  Applicant has never voted in Syria and has\nconsistently voted in the U.S. since becoming a citizen.   His parents own some property in Syria in\nthe form of a house and store.  Applicant and his brother in the U.S. have disavowed any interest in\ninheriting the property, having designated their shares to go to their siblings in Syria.  He provides\n\n3\nno financial support to his family in Syria, only giving them small gifts on special occasions.  His\nannual salary is $138,000.  His wife does not work.  The equity in his home is $350,000, and he has\na 401k investment plan valued at $100,000.  Applicant has set aside funds for his children\u2019s\neducation since their birth.  All his financial assets are in the U.S.  Applicant is active in civic affairs\nin his community, works with the cub scouts, and also works with an organization providing support\nfor children with autism.  He also has a small organization promoting interest in science among\nstudents.  Applicant is close to his wife\u2019s family in the U.S.  They visit together at least four times\na year.  The family vacations are to visit his wife\u2019s parents and his brother\u2019s family.  \nApplicant is highly regarded for his skills, diligence, integrity, and knowledge of security\nrequirements, by his three supervisors and colleagues who testified for him at the hearing and in two\nsubmitted reference letters (Ex. A and B).  All references come from persons who have held security\nclearances for many years and have worked with him on secure projects.  During his almost ten years\nin the defense industry, Applicant has never had a security violation.  \nThe Judge stated the following in his Conclusions section:  The Syrian government has\ncooperated with the U.S. in attempting to limit movement of individuals linked with radical groups\nfrom crossing into Iraq and has increased border security, which is a continuing problem for U.S.\ntroops stationed there.  The U.S. has expressed disappointment that more is not being done and is\nworking to improve the level of cooperation.  The U.S. maintains diplomatic relations with Syria and\nviews it as a strategic link to controlling militant radicals in the Middle East, particularly the transit\nvia Syria into other neighboring countries.  While Congress has placed sanctions on trade with Syria\nthrough the Syria Accountability Act, there have been recent visits by U.S. congressional delegations\nfrom both political parties in an attempt to open up a dialogue with its government to improve\nrelations and obtain greater cooperation. \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel has not expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  His contention that\nthe Judge failed to consider significant contrary record evidence will be addressed in succeeding\nparagraphs.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

If terrorists had an opportunity to hurt the United States by obtaining classified\ninformation, there is no good reason to expect they would simply ignore such an opportunity.\u201d)\n4\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge concluded that no mitigating conditions would per se justify granting Applicant\na clearance.  Rather he cleared Applicant on the basis of his whole-person analysis.  Department\nCounsel argues, however, that the Judge erred in that the whole-person factors which he mentioned\nin his decision do not squarely address the security concerns arising from an applicant\u2019s having close\nrelatives in a country adverse to the U.S.  The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s argument\npersuasive.  \nThe Judge took into account the high quality of Applicant\u2019s job performance, his residence\nin the U.S. for 20 years, and his having held a security clearance for 8 years.  The Judge also stated\nthat Applicant \u201chas little cultural contact with his country of origin\u201d and that he has taken steps \u201cto\nlimit the amount of information\u201d available to his Syrian family concerning the type of work he\nperforms.  Decision at 6.  On the other hand, as Department Counsel noted, these factors must be\nconsidered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United\nStates.  This is particularly important when there is evidence which indicates that the country in\nquestion has a poor human rights record, uses torture, supports international terrorism,  and interferes\n1\nin a neighboring country.  Indeed, Congress has passed laws imposing sanctions on Syria, sanctions\n\nSee Administrative Notice Document (AND) 5, \u201cSyria: U.S. Relations and Bilateral Issues,\u201d Aug. 18, 2006,\n2\nat 15: \u201c[T]the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act . . . requires the President to impose\npenalties on Syria unless it ceases support for international terrorist groups, ends its occupation of Lebanon, ceases the\ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and has ceased supporting or facilitating terrorist activity in Iraq.\u201d\nSee also ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007).    \nSee AND 5 at 17, to the effect that, in 2005, the U.S. Treasury Department froze the assets of a Syrian brigadier\n3\ngeneral \u201cfor playing a central part in Syria\u2019s intelligence operations in Lebanon during the Syrian occupation.\u201d     \n5\nwhich the President implemented on May 11, 2004, by executive order.   The Board has previously\n2\nnoted that an Applicant with immediate family members living in a country hostile to the U.S. has\na heavy burden to show that those family ties do not pose a security risk.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n03-09053 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006).  While the Judge stated that the record contains no evidence\nthat Syria engages in \u201ceconomic or military espionage,\u201d Department Counsel draws attention to\ncontrary record evidence of Syria\u2019s intelligence-gathering efforts in Lebanon.   \n3\nConsidering the Judge\u2019s findings, the Board concludes that \u201c[n]one of the circumstances cited\nby the Judge would present a serious obstacle to Syria . . .exercising control over Applicant\u2019s\nresident family members in order to coerce, exploit, or pressure Applicant.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n06386 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006).  In his Conclusions section, the Judge stressed that Applicant\u2019s\ncontributions to the development of U.S. defense systems have been significant and \u201c[t]o deny a\nsecurity clearance after this extensive and successful a career record would not be in the national\ninterest.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s career record, while laudable, does little to assuage the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns brought on by his connections to Syria through his relatives.  Given the close family\nrelationship between Applicant and his foreign contacts, and the relative frequency of Applicant\u2019s\ncommunication with them, the Board finds persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the\nevidence as a whole does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met his \u201cheavy burden\u201d of\npersuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for him to have a\nsecurity clearance.  Egan, 484 U.S. at 528.  See ISCR Case No. 02-04786 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 27,\n2003).  The Board holds that the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is not reasonably\nsupported by the record evidence.  \nOrder\n \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Dyer, Jr., Esq. \nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a defense industry employee with 20 years in the U.S. as a student and engineer,\nhas held a security clearance without incident for over eight years. He mitigated security concerns\nunder Guideline B arising from parents and three siblings living in Syria and having traveled there\nfive times since 1997. He showed by his own testimony and of his supervisors and colleagues, that\nhe understands security requirements and has strong ties to the U.S. and is not a security risk.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received September 29, 2006, Applicant responded to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January\n16, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued March 2, 2007 for a hearing held on March 23, 2007. The\nGovernment and Applicant each introduced two exhibits which were accepted into evidence. The\ngovernment requested that administrative notice (AN) be taken of five official government\ndocuments. Applicant and three others testified on his behalf. The transcript was received on April\n3, 2007. The record was left open for submission of written arguments by counsel for both Applicant\nand the government which were concluded on May 5, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all three allegations under Foreign Influence-Guideline B with\nexplanatory information. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a\ncomplete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following\nadditional findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as an engineer\nsince August, 2000. He was born in Syria and came to the U.S. in 1987 at age 23 after one year of\ncollege in Syria to visit his brother at a university where he was studying. Applicant decided to\ncontinue his education in the U.S. and enrolled at the same mid-western state university his brother\nattended and lived with him and his wife (Tr. 77). He studied English intensively sometimes with\nhis sister-in-law who was born in the U.S. He received a B.S. degree in engineering in 1992 followed\nby a Master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D. in 1998. His dissertation was in signal processing, a field closely\ntied to development of radar. In 1992 he married a U.S. born citizen from the same state where he\n\n3\nwas studying. He worked in various jobs while in the university and as a teaching fellow during the\nperiod of his doctoral candidacy sponsored by one of his professors. \nApplicant was employed by another large defense contractor between 1998 and 2000 in a\nmajor metropolitan area. In 2000 he moved to his present location because of his present work and\nto obtain a better school for one of his two children who has a form of autism. The children are now\nnine and five years of age. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 1996 and felt it was a great honor to be a U.S. citizen. He\nwanted to become a part of the country because he shared the same beliefs as the U.S., and the U.S.\nwas the place he wanted to live and raise a family (Tr. 84). He has held a security clearance since\n1999 when he was first employed by a defense contractor. His current application for security\nclearance (SF 86) is for a ten year renewal and was filed in 2005 (Exh. 1). He was interviewed by\na defense investigator in April, 2006 and fully discussed the circumstances of his family and travels\n(Exh. 2). \nApplicant\u2019s parents live in Syria in a suburb of Damascus where his father operates a small\nelectronics repair shop for television, radios, and appliances (Tr. 90). His mother is a homemaker\nwho has not been in good health. Both parents are in their mid-70's and have no connection with the\ngovernment. His father served a required tour in the military before the birth of Applicant. He\ntelephones his parents once a month especially because of the health of his mother (Tr. 98). \nApplicant has one brother and two sisters who also live in Syria. His brother is a truck driver\nwith little education who also served a required tour in the military as a young man (Tr. 116).\nApplicant was sponsoring the sisters for citizenship in the U.S. but one recently married and is no\nlonger interested in coming to the U.S. (Tr. 92). He continues to sponsor the second sister who is\nsingle and is a manager for a small business importing building materials from Germany (Tr. 92).\nHe has limited contacts with his siblings in Syria. He contacts them by phone 3-4 times a year (Tr.\n100). The young children of his siblings in Syria attend private schools of an internationally\nrenowned private system (Tr. 135).\nNone of the family in Syria have any contacts or work with government (Tr. 94). Applicant\u2019s\nbrother with whom he lived while in school in the U.S. lives in the U.S. and is also employed as an\nengineer with another major defense contractor. Applicant regards him as a role model and maintains\nclose contact with him. He is the only relative who knows what Applicant does and for whom he\nworks. They do not discuss their own or the other\u2019s work with other family members (Tr. 124). \nApplicant has traveled to Syria five times since 1997 when he first took his wife to meet his\nfamily. His other trips were in 2000 so that his older child could meet his parents, and in 2001 for\na family wedding. This trip was encouraged by his colleagues since he had recently began work for\nhis present employer, was working hard, and they thought he needed a vacation (Tr. 29). The trips\nin 2004 and 2005 were related to the illness of his mother (Tr. 100-102). The last two trips were\ntaken alone for cost reasons. He has always used his U.S. passport for travel to Syria. He has notified\nhis security office of all of his trips since his employment in the defense industry (Tr. 41) even\nthough company policy did not fully require it (Tr. 62). He was not required to give a report on his\nreturn and did not do so. He has never had difficulty in travel or been approached by any suspicious\n\n4\ncontacts (Tr. 136). If anything such as that occurred,  he knows to report the events to the cognizable\nsecurity authority. His family in Syria have had no difficulty from the government or any other group\n(Tr. 137). His father indoctrinated his children against working for the government and encouraged\nthem to work for the private sector and to have little to do with the government (Tr. 122). \nBecause of current security implications, Applicant does not intend to return to Syria even\nthough he has continuing concerns for his mother. He regards Syria as a place with no future and a\ncorrupt government (Tr. 127-130).\nApplicant has never voted in Syria and has consistently voted in the U.S. in local, state, and\nfederal elections since becoming a citizen (Tr. 105). Although his parents own some property in\nSyria in the form of a house and store, Applicant and his brother in the U.S. have disavowed any\ninterest in inheriting it, and have designated their share to go to their siblings in Syria (Tr. 106). He\nprovides no financial support to his family in Syria only giving them only small gifts on special\noccasions. His annual salary is $138,000. His wife does not work. The equity in his home is\n$350,000 and he has a 401k investment plan valued at $100,000 (Tr. 131). He has set aside funds\nfor his children\u2019s education since their birth. All his financial assets are in the U.S. Applicant is\nactive in civic affairs in his community, works with the cub scouts, and an organization providing\nsupport for children with autism. He also has a small organization promoting interest in science\namong students. \nApplicant is close to his wife\u2019s family in the U.S. Although they are Christians and he is\nMuslim, all accept each other and have a solid family relationship. They visit together at least four\ntimes a year. The family vacations are to visit his wife\u2019s parents and his brother\u2019s family. \nApplicant is highly regarded for his skills, diligence, integrity, and knowledge of security\nrequirements, by his three supervisors and colleagues who testified for him at the hearing (Tr. 23-61)\nand in the two submitted reference letters (Exh. A and B). All come from persons who have held\nsecurity clearances for many years and have worked with him on secure projects. He is regarded as\nhaving one of the best work ethics in the organization. Since him employment, he has been given\nincreased responsibilities and is regarded as one of top lead engineers. He is regarded as a key\nmember of the engineering staff working on his company projects. He is highly regarded for\ntrustworthiness with a reputation for honesty and integrity. He knows security regulations and\nrequirements and goes beyond the company security requirements. He is described as a \u201cstalwart\u201d\nwho follows all the rules and regulations. He knows that any possible breach of security requires\nimmediate reporting to security officers. During his almost ten years in the defense industry , he has\nnever had a security violation. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\n\n5\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR: \nConditions under Foreign Influence Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include having an individual\u2019s immediate family and other persons to whom he or\nshe may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may\nbe subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result\nin the compromise of classified information.(E2.A2.1.1) Having immediate family members who\nare citizens of, and residing in a foreign country, may raise a disqualifying security concern.\n(E2.A2.1.2.1) Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government\nestablished reasons to raise security concerns because of foreign influence. Having established such\nreasons, Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes,\nmitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nMitigating conditions that might be applicable to allegations relating to his family are a\ndetermination that the individuals in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to\nbe exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty\nto the persons involved and the U.S.(E2.A2.1.3.1.), and contacts and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent. (E2.A2.1.3.3.) While his relatives are not agents of a foreign\npower, by definition parents and siblings are persons with close ties of affection. Thus, the specific\nmitigating conditions are not applicable.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\n\n6\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant has had a responsible position of trust in the defense industry and has done an\nexcellent job for his company and a former employer for nine years. He has held a security clearance\nfor eight of those years without incident. He provided sincere and credible testimony as to his\nrelationship with his family, his motivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. He was educated in the U.S.,\nand is integrated into U.S. culture after living here for 20 years beginning as a college student. His\ntotal financial stakes are in the U.S. He has little cultural contact with his country of origin and has\na negative view of the future there and the state of its government. He has taken appropriate steps\nto limit the amount of information that his family in Syria knows who he works for and the type of\nwork he performs.\nWhile there is no evidence in the documents submitted for administrative notice that Syria\nhas engaged in economic or military espionage, it has an extensive record of harboring and\nsupporting terrorist organizations and interfering in the affairs of its neighbor Lebanon. There is\nevidence of violations of human rights of its citizens including labor rights, freedom of the press, and\nfreedom of expression (AN 1). Although the government is a one party state with the Baath party\nbeing the only recognized party, it is a secular state and has taken steps to limit extreme\nfundamentalism (AN 5). \nThe Syrian government has cooperated with the U.S. in attempting to limit movement of\nindividuals linked with radical groups from crossing into Iraq and increased border security (AN 3)\nwhich is a continuing problem for U.S. troops stationed there. The U.S. has expressed\ndisappointment that more is not being done and is working to improve the level of cooperation. The\nU.S. maintains diplomatic relations with Syria and views it as a strategic link to controlling militant\nradicals in the middle east particularly the transit via Syria into other neighboring countries. While\nCongress has placed sanctions on trade with Syria (AN 5) through the Syria Accountability Act,\nthere have been recent visits by U.S. congressional delegations from both political parties in an\nattempt to open up a dialogue with its government to improve relations and obtain greater\ncooperation. \nApplicant is a highly valued professional who knows how to deal with any pressures that\nmight be brought against him by agents of a foreign government. He has taken appropriate steps to\nlimit his contacts with Syria and gone beyond requirements of his company to comply with any\npossible security concerns of the U.S. or his employer. His financial and career stakes are in the U.S.\nwhere he has made a successful life since coming here over 20 years ago. Thus, he has spent most\nof his adult life in the U.S. His contributions to development of defense systems has been significant.\nTo deny a security clearance after this extensive and successful a career record would not be in the\nnational interest. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\n\n7\nclearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nAfter full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case,\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 20, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline H is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n1\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline H had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was not\nrecent, and Applicant had demonstrated that he would not use drugs in the future and had provided\nclear evidence of rehabilitation.  In support of this argument, Applicant submits additional\n2\ndocumentary evidence which was not submitted at the hearing.  He also cites to several DOHA\nHearing Office decisions in which an applicant in ostensibly similar circumstances was granted a\nclearance.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005). \nThe decision in another DOHA Hearing Office case does not demonstrate error by the Judge\nin this case.  A decision by a Hearing Office Judge is not legally binding precedent on that Judge\u2019s\ncolleagues or the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2003).\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See\nISCR Case No. 05-02833 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\n\nThe Judge found Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine, psilocybin mushrooms, PCP, and LSD to be mitigated.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B is a statement, signed by Applicant, in which he swears never to use illegal drugs again.\n4\nHe further states that he expects that any violation of this promise will result in the automatic revocation of his clearance.\nSee Guideline H Mitigating Condition 26(b)(4).  This is evidence which a Judge must consider, but it is not binding.\nRather, its mitigating effect must be evaluated in light of the record as a whole.  \n3\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn this case, the Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy history of marijuana use.\nThat history included illegal marijuana use, on at least 1,000 occasions and at times including daily\nuse, from approximately 1977 to January 2005.  It also included the illegal purchase of marijuana\nduring the same period of time.  A review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the record evidence relating to the length,\nseriousness and recency of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant\nwith respect to four of the factual allegations.   However, the Judge reasonably explained why the\n3\nevidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.   The Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that\n4\nwas before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline H is not\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12548  at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n18, 2006).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan       \nMichael Y.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on February 20, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nApril 17, 2009. DOHA initially issued a notice of hearing on April 23 2009, and the\nhearing was scheduled to be heard on June 24, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii. Because of\nscheduling issues, the hearing was rescheduled, and a second notice of hearing was\nissued on May 15, 2009. The hearing convened on July 24, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n \n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 10, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and he submitted Exhibits A through F,\nwhich were entered without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr)\non August 10, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to South Korea.  The request and the attached documents were\nadmitted into evidence as Exhibit 10. Applicant\u2019s counsel also submitted documents\nregarding South Korea (Exhibit F), and I have reviewed and incorporated them also.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 52 years old. He is married, and he has two children. His son and\ndaughter are U.S. citizens. He has received two Bachelor\u2019s degrees, one in Business\nAdministration and one in Information Systems. Applicant was born in the United States.\nHe served in the United States Army from 1984 to 2004, and he received many\ndecorations, medals, and badges, as reviewed in Exhibit A, Applicant\u2019s DD Form 214.\nHis family, including his mother, father, four brothers, and two sisters are all U.S. born\ncitizens, and they reside in the U.S. \nApplicant first lived in South Korea while he was in the U.S. Army. He continues\nto live in South Korea, and works for a U.S. defense contractor there. Applicant has had\na a DoD security clearance since 1995, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe SOR lists 3 allegations under Adjudicative Guideline B. All of the allegations\nwill be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a.  Applicant\u2019s wife, who is 48 year old, is a citizen and resident of South Korea.\nApplicant met his wife in South Korea, while he served in the U.S. Army. They have\nbeen married almost 18 years. He testified that it is his wife\u2019s intention to become a\nUnited States citizen, and she has begun the process of acquiring a green card and will\nthereafter apply when appropriate to ger her U.S. citizenship. It is his plan for his family\nto move back to the United States by the summer of 2010 (Tr at 47-48). Applicant\u2019s wife\nis not employed.\n\n3\n1.b. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of South Korea, and she is\n60 or 62 years old. She lives with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s older sister. Applicant estimated that\nhe sees his mother-in-law every four months, although she was living with him and his\nwife at one point in 2008. His wife talks to her once or twice a week, and he speaks to\nher \u201chardly ever.\u201d \n1.c. Applicant\u2019s siblings-in-law, which includes two sisters and a brother of\nApplicant\u2019s wife, are citizens and residents of South Korea. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law\nhas his own construction business. Neither he nor his wife ever worked for the Korean\nGovernment. Applicant\u2019s older sister-in-law does not work. Her husband was in the\nRepublic of Korean (ROK) marines for 20 years and is now retired. He was a lieutenant\ncolonel before he retired in 2008. He is now a consultant for the marines. His younger\nsister-in-law does not work and her husband is a salesman. Applicant\u2019s contact with his\nin-laws is infrequent. \nApplicant does not own any property in Korea. He deposits his paycheck in a\nU.S. bank. He also has the assets of his 401k in the United States. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline K - Handling Protected Information) \nThe SOR lists 2 allegations under Adjudicative Guideline K. The allegations will\nbe discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n2.a. On or about December 1 and 2, 2004, Applicant failed to properly secure\nclassified information, while employed in South Korea, in violation of Paragraph 6-9 of\nArmy Regulation 380-5.\nApplicant explained the situation that resulted in this violation. He was working\nwith a coworker, making upgrades on laptop computers. Since they were not going to\nfinish in one day, his coworker suggested that they keep the computers working\nthroughout the night, so when they came back to work in the morning, the upgrades\nwould be complete. They secured the area, and did leave the computers running until\nthe next day. Applicant conceded that the correct course of action would have been to\nsecure the computers in a safe overnight, and begin working on them again the next\nday. When his supervisor came in the next day, he questioned Applicant about the\ncomputers. Applicant testified that he honestly explained to his supervisor what they\nhad done, and during an investigation that was held, he also cooperated and explained\nhis action. \nNo unauthorized information was revealed as a result of Applicant\u2019s conduct. As\na result of the investigation, Applicant received a written counseling statement. No other\npunishment was meted out for this infraction, and Applicant testified that he has never\nleft the computers out of the safe at night after this incident (Tr at 65-77).\n2.b. On or about April 1, 2005, Applicant failed to properly secure a security\ncontainer, while employed in South Korea, in violation of Army Regulation 380-5.\n\n4\nApplicant testified that this incident resulted when Applicant opened a secured\nsafe, and while the safe was still open, he moved about three feet into another room,\nwhere he greeted a secretary. Another individual came into the room, and it did not look\nlike anyone was with the open safe, so he filed a report. He estimated that the safe was\nunattended for a minute or less (Tr at 125). Applicant testified that, as a result of this\ninfraction, his punishment was to give a security course on base. He satisfied this\nrequirement. \nAs stated above, Applicant has maintained a security clearance since 1995, and\nhe testified that the two violations described above are the only violations that he has\nreceived from 1995 to the present, a span of 14 years (Tr at 64-65).\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n3.a. The Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s security violation, as alleged in\nparagraph 2, above exhibits questionable judgement and unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations. \n3.b. Applicant informed an investigator of the Department of Defense in an\naffidavit, signed by him on February 4, 2008, that he had unintentionally left 10 to 12\nclassified hard drives in laptop computers overnight in December 2004. The SOR\nalleges that Applicant failed to disclose that the hard drives were not secured because\nApplicant was performing required system maintenance and did not want to stop the\nprocess.  \nApplicant testified that when the investigator asked him about these security\nviolations, specifically the one reviewed under 2.b., above, Applicant replied that it had\nbeen four years earlier and he did not really have a good recollection of the event. The\ninvestigator asked him whether the violation had been intentional or unintentional, and\nApplicant answered unintentional. Applicant conceded that he had been in error, as he\nhad left the computers out of the safe for a specific purpose, to upgrade them. After his\nmemory was refreshed he realized his error. However, Applicant never denied to the\ninvestigator that he had committed the act that was the subject of the violation (Tr at 85-\n92). \nMitigation\nApplicant also offered into evidence three affidavits from individuals who know or\nhave known him in his professional life (Exhibit E). They all were extremely laudatory in\ndescribing  Applicant as \u201cdefendable, reliable, honest and trustworthy.\u201d\n\n5\nStatus of South Korea \nSouth Korea is currently a stable democratic republic. The United States and\nSouth Korea have been close allies since 1950, and have fought communism on the\nKorean peninsula and in Vietnam. The United States, since 1950 and currently, has\nthousands of U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea, and  frequently conducts\njoint military operations with South Korea. About 2.3 million Koreans live in the United\nStates. South Korea is the United States\u2019 seventh largest trading partner. The South\nKorean Government generally respects the human right of its citizens. South Korea has\na history of collecting protected U.S. information. However, as stated by President\nObama on April 2, 2009, \u201c[South] Korea is one of Americas closest allies and greatest\nfriends.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n6\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\n      Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\n\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion\u201d; and (d) \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s relatives, including his wife, mother-in-\nlaw, and siblings-in-law, who are citizens and residents of South Korea make DC (a) a\nconcern to the Government. His wife, who is also a citizen and resident of South Korea,\nand whose mother is both a citizen and resident of South Korea, make DC (d)\napplicable.  \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC): (b) \u201cthere\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \n\n7\nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and controlling for the following\nreasons: Applicant, who is 52 years old, was born in the United States and is a natural\nborn United States citizen. While he is married to a South Korean citizen, she is\nplanning to apply for U.S. citizenship when she is eligible.  The two children of Applicant\nand his wife are being raised solely as U.S. citizens. Applicant served in the United\nStates Army from 1984 to 2004, during which he received many commendations and\nawards. His immediate family, including his mother, father, three brothers, and two\nsisters are all U.S. born citizens, and they reside in the U.S. Applicant has no assets in\nSouth Korea, and his savings and 401(k) are in United States banking facilities.\nApplicant does not have a close relationship with any of his relatives through\nmarriage, in South Korea. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that Applicant has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information\nWith respect to Guideline K, the Government has established that Applicant\ncommitted two incidents of security violations, in 2004 and 2005.  His conduct comes\nwithin the DC \u00b6 34. (g) \u201cfailure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or\nother sensitive information.\u201d\nIn reviewing the Mitigating Conditions (MC) under \u00b6 35., I find that Applicant\u2019s\nviolations occurred in 2004 and 2005, and are the only ones reported during the last 14\nyears, when Applicant has had a security clearance. I find that MC (a) \u201cso much time\nhas elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently, . . . that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgement\u201d is applicable.  I also find that  MC (b) \u201cthe individual now demonstrates\na positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities\u201d applies in this case.  \nIn this case, the Government has met its burden of proving that Applicant has\nnegligently failed to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified\ninformation, which raises doubt about his trustworthiness, judgement, reliability and\nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information. However, since there have been\nonly two violations in 14 years, the last occurring in 2005, I find that these events have\nbeen mitigated by time and infrequency, and Applicant has mitigated the Government's\nconcern against him. Accordingly, Paragraph 2, Guideline K of the SOR, is concluded\nfor Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, I find that Applicant\u2019s security clearance violations\nare not sufficient to come under DC \u00b6 (d) (3) because his pattern of rules violations do\nnot \u201csupport a whole-person assessment of untrustworthiness, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d  I also find that his statement made\nto the investigator was not made in an attempt to mislead the Government. I resolve\nParagraph 3, Guideline E, for Applicant.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.            \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines B, K, and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above as to why the Mitigating Conditions outweigh\nthe Disqualifying Conditions under each Guideline, the consideration of Applicant\u2019s\ntwenty year service to the United States Army, and the strong letters of\nrecommendation, I find that the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline K:   \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2009.  He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 10, 2009, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on June 15, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on July 31, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 12, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 17, 2009.  The Government\noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.  Applicant\n\n2\ntestified on his own behalf, as did four witnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A\nthrough D, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on\nSeptember 25, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nOctober 15, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On September 28, 2009, and on or\nabout October 15, 2009, he submitted Exhibits E and F, without objection.  As AppX E\nwas not forwarded to the undersigned, by the Department Counsel, until October 19,\n2009, the record closed on October 19, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Iran.  The request was granted.  The request, and the\nattached documents, were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations, with\nexplanations.  The Applicant emigrated to the U.S. in 1986, at the age of 14, to be with\nhis natural mother (TR at page 95 line 3 to page 98 line 21).  He became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in 1994 (Id).  He served in the U.S. Navy from 1992 to 1997, obtaining the\nrank of E-5, Quartermaster 2  class (TR at page 39 line 21 to page 41 line 25, and\nnd\nAppXs A and B).  The Applicant served his adopted country honorably (AppXs A and\nB).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Iran.  He retired\nfrom the Iranian Department of Maritime Ports and Shipping (TR at page 86 line 20 to\npage 88 line 21).  He was hired under the Shah\u2019s regime, but retired under the current\nregime (Id).  He has little contact with his father, and describes his feelings in the\nfollowing terms:\nI do not feel any sentiments towards my father.  I recall that he was not a\nterribly nice husband to my mother.  So therefore, I have no connections\nwith him.  No emotional ties (TR at page 100 lines 3~9).\nThe Applicant also has a half-brother, a half-sister, and a stepmother who are\ncitizens and residents of Iran.  His half-brother is \u201ca full time student\u201d (TR at page 88 line\n22 to page 89 line 7).  He is unsure of what his half-sister does, and his stepmother is\n\u201cjust a housewife\u201d (TR at page 89 line 8 to page 90 line 3).  His contact with his half\nsiblings and his stepmother is \u201c[v]ery rare\u201d (TR at page 89 line16 to page 90 line 13).\n\n3\n1.c. and 2.b.  The Applicant visited Iran in October of 2007, using his Iranian\npassport to enter and exit the country (TR at page 91 lines 3~6).  He \u201chad a curiosity\nabout the family members that were still there,\u201d and \u201calso was interested in seeing some\nhistoric sites\u201d (TR at page 104 lines 14~24).  He was there for about \u201ca month,\u201d but has\nno intention of visiting Iran in the future (TR at page 101 lines 23~24, and at page 107\nline 23 to page 108 line 22).\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n2.a.  The Applicant renewed his Iranian passport in November of 2003, despite\nbeing naturalized in September of 1994 (TR at page 91 lines 7~16).  That passport has\nsince expired, and has been surrendered to and destroyed by the Applicant\u2019s Facility\nSecurity Officer (FSO) (TR at page 104 lines 14 to 24, at page 107 line 23 to page 108\nline 22, and AppX F).  This is evidenced by a statement from the Applicant\u2019s FSO (AppX\nF).  The Applicant is willing to renounce any Iranian citizenship he may have, but\nbelieves he had already done so when he joined the U.S. Navy (TR at page 91 line 17\nto page 92 line 3, and at page 104 line 25 to page 105 line 6).\nAs the Applicant\u2019s father, half-siblings, and step mother are Iranian and live in\nIran, I must also consider the country of Iran.  Iran is possibly the most serious threat to\nthe U.S.  Iran is a state that sponsors terrorism.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic\nrelations with Iran since 1980.  It is a theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim\nclergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political authority is vested in a\nlearned religious scholar.  Iran\u2019s dismal and worsening human rights record presents a\nfurther threat to the U.S., as a large number of Iranians emigrated to the U.S. in 1979,\nafter their Islamic revolution.  These immigrants often left behind family members in\nIran.  Iran\u2019s security forces often target family members of political prisoners for\nharassment purposes.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a\nforeign interest.\nHere, Paragraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . .\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nATphpisli cisa nctl\u2019esa fralyth ceoru, ntwteor ehda,l fh-soiwbleinvgesr, abny dth set efpirsmt omthiteigr aatrineg c citoiznednisti oonf ,a ansd \u201c theesi dnea tiunr eIr aonf .t h e\n\n5\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . . .\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  The\nApplicant rarely contacts, and has little emotional ties to, his Iranian relatives.  Apart\nfrom his father, who was hired under the Shah\u2019s regime, none of his Iranian relatives\nhave any connection with the Iranian government.  Furthermore, I find the Applicant, a\nformer member of the U.S. Navy, cannot be coerced by the government of Iran or any\nother government.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nParagraph 9 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Preference:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nSubparagraph 10(a)(1) is applicable: \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation\nof foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport.\u201d  Here, the Applicant, a naturalized citizen, used an Iranian passport to enter\nthat country in 2007.  This is clearly countered, however, by the mitigating conditions\nfound under Subparagraphs 11(b) and 11(e).  Subparagraph 11(b) notes that where\n\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d this is\nmitigating.  I find that Applicant\u2019s renunciation intention to be genuine.  Furthermore,\nunder Subparagraph 11(e), the Applicant\u2019s \u201cpassport has been destroyed [by] . . . the\ncognizant security authority,\u201d his FSO.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n6\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe record shows that the Applicant has little or no contact with Iran; and as\nsuch, can not be coerced vis-a-vis any of his Iranian relatives.  He understands his\nresponsibility to the U.S., while holding a security clearance; and as such, clearly meets\nthe eligibility criterion.\nFurthermore, he has the unqualified support of those who know and have worked\nwith the Applicant (TR at page 53 line 8 to page 85 line 10).  A Senior Vice President\n(VP) of his firm, another VP, and his direct supervisor speak most highly of the\nApplicant (Id).  They all feel he is trustworthy; and as such, should be granted a security\nclearance.\nI have considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his alleged Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 31, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 14, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H.\n\n2\nMogul granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge\nerred by finding that Guideline B, Mitigating Condition 1 was applicable in this case, and whether\nthe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was unsustainable.  We remand the case to the Administrative\nJudge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts\n \nTh Judge made the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 25 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1981.  He moved to the United States in 1998, with both\nof his parents, and he became a naturalized United States citizen in July 1, 2004. When Applicant\nreceived his United States citizenship, he petitioned to change his name to a more American\nsounding name.\nApplicant is unmarried and has no children.  He received a Bachelor of Science degree in\nElectrical Engineering from a United States university in 2005.  He is in the process of applying to\nUnited States universities to pursue a Masters of Business Administration degree.\nApplicant's mother and father have also become naturalized United States citizens, residing\nin the United States.  His mother is a retired housewife and lives with Applicant. His father works\nin the motel industry for Applicant's two uncles in the United States.\nApplicant 's sister and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His sister is a\nstay-at-home mother, and his brother-in-law owns and manages a private auto body shop. Neither\nof them belong to, participate in, or are active with any government agency of Taiwan, or receive\nany benefits from the Taiwanese Government. Their daughter was born in the United States and is\na dual United States and Taiwanese citizen. Applicant speaks to his sister once a month, and sees\nher once a year, when she visits the United States. His sister and brother-in-law are in the process\nof applying for United States residency and citizenship.\nApplicant visited Taiwan from December 2004 to January 2005, to see his sister and\nbrother-in-law. He testified that during this trip, he saw no one else whom he knew, except these\nfamily members\nApplicant does not have any financial interest in Taiwan. At this time he has limited financial\nholdings, but what he has is only in the United States.\nApplicant submitted five letters from individuals who know him in different capacities in\nhis place of employment. These letters all discussed Applicant in extremely positive terms as a hard\nworking, conscientious and trustworthy individual. He also introduced his 2005 Employee\n\nOne of the pertinent exhibits was discussed at length in a recent Appeal Board case, ISCR Case No. 03-21434\n1\nat 4-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007).  That exhibit, entitled Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage (dated 2000), was one of several stipulated to by both parties in the instant case, so notice and\nadmissability are not properly at issue here as they were in that case.\n3\nPerformance Review for his first year of employment. This first evaluation was fairly positive as\nall of his assessments met or exceeded expectations.\nApplicant testified as to his strong feelings for the United States and his desire to remain\nhere. He also stated that he has registered, as required, for Selective Service.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s finding of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to his credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel challenges\nthe Judge\u2019s findings as inadequate.  The Judge failed to make any findings regarding the nature of\nthe foreign country at issue, Taiwan.  This failure will be discussed in context of the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions.\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  We review matters of law de\nnovo.\nThe Board has established that: \u201cIn Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign\ngovernment involved in the case and the intelligence gathering history of that government are\nimportant evidence that provides context for all the other evidence of record and must be brought\nto bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No 04-07766 at 3\n(App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006).\nIn the instant case, the Judge\u2019s decision is completely silent as to the evidence  of record\n1\nregarding Taiwan\u2019s history of intelligence gathering and industrial espionage.  The Judge\u2019s omission\nin that regard renders his decision arbitrary and capricious, in that it affected his ability to evaluate\nproperly the significance of Applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 citizenship and residency in Taiwan, and to\nevaluate  properly the applicability of the guidelines including the Guideline B mitigating factors.\n\n4\nIn light of the forgoing error and the overall state of the record otherwise, the Board concludes that\nremand for correction of the error is the appropriate disposition for this case.  Therefore, it is\npremature to address the other appeal issues.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Bohn, Esq.\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1981, moved to the United States\nin 1998 with his parents, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2004.  His mother and\nfather have also become United States citizens. Applicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of Taiwan.

They are not in a position to be exploited by Taiwan in a way that\ncould force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the\nUnited States. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), dated August 31, 2006, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted\nor denied. The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign\nresidency and/or citizenship of close family members.\nApplicant filed a notarized response, dated September 20, 2006, to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On October 19, 2006,\nthe case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice,\ndated November 8, 2006, a hearing was held on November 29, 2006. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Government\nExhibits 1-7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant  offered 21 documentary exhibits (Exhibits\nA-U) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on December 8, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive. The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a., and 1.b.,\nunder Guideline B. Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 25 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\n\n3\nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1981. He moved  to the United States in 1998, with both\nof his parents, and he became a naturalized United States citizen in July 1, 2004.  When Applicant\nreceived his United States citizenship, he petitioned to change his name to a more American\nsounding name (Exhibit L).\nApplicant is unmarried and has no children. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in\nElectrical Engineering from a United States university in 2005 (Exhibit F). He is in the process of\napplying to United States universities to pursue a Masters of Business Administration degree.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father have also become naturalized United States citizens, residing\nin the United States. His mother is a retired housewife and lives with Applicant. His father works\nin the motel industry for Applicant\u2019s two uncles in the United States (Tr at 54).  \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nApplicant \u2018s sister and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  His sister is a\nstay-at-home mother, and his brother-in-law owns and manages a private auto body shop. Neither\nof them belong to, participate in, or are active with any government agency of Taiwan, or receive any\nbenefits from the Taiwanese Government. Their daughter was born in the United States and is a dual\nUnited States and Taiwanese citizen. Applicant speaks to his sister once a month, and sees her once\na year, when she visits the United States. His sister and brother-in-law are in the process of applying\nfor United States residency and citizenship. (Exhibits S and T).\nApplicant visited Taiwan from December 2004  to January 2005, to see his sister and brother-\nin-law.  He testified that during this trip, he saw no one else whom he knew, except these family\nmembers (Tr at 55-56).\nApplicant does not have any financial interest in Taiwan. At this time he has limited financial\nholdings, but what he has is only in the United States (Exhibits G and H).\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted five letters from individuals who know him in different capacities in his\nplace of employment. These letters all discussed Applicant in extremely positive terms as a hard\nworking, conscientious and trustworthy individual (Exhibits A-E). He also introduced his 2005\nEmployee Performance Review for his first year of employment (Exhibit J). This first evaluation was\nfairly positive as all of his assessments met or exceeded expectations.\nFinally, Applicant testified as to his strong feelings for the United States and his desire to\nremain here. He also stated that he has registered, as required, for Selective Service (Tr at 43-45).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\n\n4\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,\n\n5\nare not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record,\nthe Government has established an initial  reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant \u2018s sister and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan. The Taiwanese\ncitizenship and residency of Applicant's family create the potential for foreign influence that could\nresult in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable\nto coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient\nto require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his\nburden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for him. This Applicant has done.\n  The evidence of Applicant\u2019s family members, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan,\ncomes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, \u201cimmediate family members, or persons\nto whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in,\na foreign country.\u201d\nThe primary factors in mitigation that I have considered include: Applicant\u2019s  history since\ncoming to the United States including receiving Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering\nfrom a United States university in 2005; becoming a U. S. citizen in 2004; the lack of government\ninvolvement of Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan, who are in the process of moving to the United States;\nhis devotion to his parents in the United States; and finally his strong feelings for this country.  \nBased on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence,  I have determined\nthat his family in Taiwan does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Condition\n(MC) E2.A2.1.3.1, \u201ca determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not\nagents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could\nforce the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States,\u201d\napplies.\n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event\npressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it and\nwould  report the incident to the proper authorities. \n \n        \nOn balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's evidence opposing\nhis request for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

In each case, the charges were challenged by Applicant for reasons she did nothing wrong.\nThe record lacks any evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s explanations of the events and circumstances\nunderlying her respective arrests.

Considering\nApplicant\u2019s explanations and her overall record of meritorious service with her employer,\nApplicant\u2019s arrests are concluded to be unsubstantiated.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 25, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 7, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on June 12, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on July 23, 2007.  A hearing was\nJuly 23, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of two  exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and three\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 1, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to strike paragraph 1.e of the\nSOR.  There being no objection from Applicant, and good cause shown, Department Counsel\u2019s\nmotion was granted. \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested on multiple occasions between\nMay 1999 and May 2004 (four in all) and charged with assault/domestic violence and related\ncharges, with the charges in each of the listed cases dismissed.  She is also alleged to have been\ncharged in January 1980 with unauthorized personnel in the barracks room, for which she was fined\na $100.00 a month for two months and placed on three months probation.\nFor her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the separate charges.  She\ndenied only the January 1980 unauthorized personnel in barracks charges (which were subsequently\n\n3\nremoved from the SOR as a source of security concern).  Applicant provided explanations of the\ncircumstances associated with each of her domestic violence arrests.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nApplicant is a 44year-old assembly technician for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant has been married for 23 years to the same husband (H) and has three children (ages\n6, 7 and 11).  She also has a niece (age 20) who has been living with her since her enrollment in the\nseventh grade (R.T., at 19).\n  \nPrior to 1999, Applicant had never been in any kind of trouble with law enforcement\nauthorities (R.T., at 20).  Applicant was three months pregnant in May 1999 and suspected H was\nhaving an affair with another woman.  On her way home (with her son in the car) on May 9, 1999\n(mother\u2019s day), she passed by her uncle\u2019s house.  In the driveway of her uncle\u2019s house she observed\nH and an another woman sitting atop of their family car.  Upon confronting H, she learned that he\nhad been having an affair with the woman (R.T., at 20-21).  Upset over what she learned, she threw\na small rock at H\u2019s car window and shattered the window glass.  Some unidentified person, in turn,\nthen called the police  who responded to the call.  Once the police arrived, Applicant confirmed to\nthe police that she had thrown a rock at their car, which broke the window.   Based on Applicant\u2019s\nacknowledgment and H\u2019s insistence, the police arrested Applicant and charged her with\nassault/domestic violence, damage to property, and disorderly conduct.  Once she explained the\nevents to the court, the court referred her to domestic violence classes and deferred adjudication.\nOnce she documented completing the classes, the court dismissed the charges against her (R.T., at\n23). \nThe following week (on May 18, 1999), Applicant and H became involved in another\ndomestic argument upon his return home.  H threatened Applicant with calling the police and taking\ntheir son from their home.  When she did not leave alone, he called the police.  When the police\narrived at their home, H claimed Applicant tore his shirt.  Despite Applicant\u2019s denials, the police\nplaced her under arrest and escorted her to the local police station for booking.  Once in court to\nanswer charges of domestic violence/assault and domestic violence criminal damage, Applicant\npersuaded the court that H was at fault and obtained a restraining order against his coming to their\nhome.  Pending charges against Applicant, in turn, were dismissed.\nSoon after her May 1999 court appearances, Applicant and H reconciled.  They managed to\nlive together for a number of years in relative harmony before their marriage began to unravel over\nrenewed Applicant concerns about her husband\u2019s fidelity.   \nIn May 2003, Applicant was approached by her brother (B), who asked to borrow money\nfrom her.  B was renting a trailer from Applicant and H at the time and sometimes encountered\ndifficulties paying his  rent (R.T., at 23-24).  Applicant\u2019s mother and B\u2019s wife had passed away, and\nB had few financial resources to care for his two girls (one being Applicant\u2019s niece).  B\u2019s financial\nproblems were compounded after he remarried to a woman who had three children of her own.  B\n\n4\nhad since married C and often pressed Applicant to lend him money to pay his rent (R.T., at 24).\nConcerned about B and his daughters after their mother passed away, Applicant did not want to force\nB to vacate the trailer (R.T., at 23-24). \nWhen Applicant arrived at B\u2019s trailer, she was greeted by her niece, who said her father was\ntoo ill to come out to talk with her.  Overhearing the niece\u2019s request to leave with Applicant,\nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law (C) interrupted Applicant\u2019s conversation with her niece and intervened in\nApplicant\u2019s conversation with her niece.  Arguments ensued between Applicant and C (R.T., at 24,\n39-40).  Applicant then left the trailer site without her niece and returned home.\nFollowing her return home, a police officer came to the house and questioned her about\nwhether she had been to B\u2019s trailer.  When Applicant responded affirmatively, the police officer\ninformed her that B\u2019s wife claimed Applicant struck her in the arm (R.T., at 25).  Despite her denials,\nthe officer then placed her under arrest and took her to the police station to face charges of\nassault/minor injury-domestic violence.  After telling her story of innocence to the court, the court\ndismissed the charges against her (R.T., at 25-26).  Thereafter, H informed B and his wife that since\nhe could not control his wife, they must vacate the trailer (R.T., at 40). \nFollowing her 2003 arrest, Applicant did not speak to either B or C for a considerable period\nof time.  She had maintained physical custody of her niece for a number of years when B called her\non or about May 31, 2004 to inquire about seeing his daughter. After telling Applicant that he and\nhis wife were separated, B told her that his other daughter missed her sister (Applicant\u2019s niece) and\nwanted to see her (R.T., at 26-28).  Believing everything was alright with B and his family, Applicant\nconsented to bringing  her niece over to B\u2019s apartment.  \nOnce B told C that Applicant had been over to see him, she called the police and claimed\nApplicant had come to her place and assaulted her (R.T., at 27-28).  A short time later, a police\nofficer came to Applicant\u2019s house and asked if she had been to her sister-in-law\u2019s house.  Applicant\nreplied she had not.  Despite Applicant\u2019s denial, this police officer arrested Applicant for\nassault/domestic violence, disorderly conduct and false report to law enforcement.  When Applicant\nappeared in court to answer charges stemming from her May 2004 arrest, the charges were dismissed\n(R.T., at 28).  Since the dismissal of these charges, Applicant has had no further contact with B and\nher sister-in-law (R.T., at 30-32).\nIn the week preceding her security clearance hearing in this matter, Applicant became\ninvolved in a domestic quarrel with H over the same woman H was seeing in 1999.  Applicant claims\nH struck their son in the face (R.T., at 51-53).  Police investigated the incident but made no arrests\nor report that can be documented. Applicant says she intends to seek a divorce from H (R.T., at 54)\nand will ascertain whether H moved out of their house when she returns home after the hearing. \n There are no available police reports to shed any further light on the events and\ncircumstances associated with any of Applicant\u2019s arrests.  The FBI\u2019s arrest identification record (see\nex. 2) reports only the individual arrests and supplies no additional information about the events and\ncircumstances and dispositions.  Without any more record evidence to counter Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations of the underlying events, her explanations are entitled to acceptance.  \n\n5\nApplicant has good references.  Her first-line supervisor and colleagues who have worked\nwith her over the past seven years and are familiar with her work habits describe her as a good team\nplayer who is always available to help and train other personnel, and does so in a positive,\nprofessional and trustworthy way (see ex. B; R.T., at 34-36).  Applicant is held in high esteem by\nher colleagues and is considered a dedicated assembler.\nApplicant is the recipient of numerous certificates and awards recognizing her service\nachievements with her employer (see ex. C; R.T., at 34-35).  Her certificates and awards commend\nher for her commitments and dedication to her employer over a 15-year period of service.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\napplicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make\na common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of\nan applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those\ninferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\n\n6\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a meritorious satellite technician who has been the subject of a number of\ndomestic violence arrests (four altogether) between May 1999 and May 2004.   Security concerns\nare  raised over Applicant\u2019s arrest history, despite the ensuing dismissal of each of them.  \nApplicant\u2019s four domestic violence arrests warrant initial consideration of  two disqualifying\nconditions of the  Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: DC 31a (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) and DC 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged).  However, each of Applicant\u2019s four arrests resulted in\ndismissals of the underlying charges and no reports of statements from police, participants, or\nwitnesses that, if present, might serve to challenge Applicant\u2019s claims of the events and\ncircumstances of the underlying events. \nWithout any evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s explanations of the underlying events and\ncircumstances, the criminal conduct concerns that are based on her four respective arrests are not\nsubstantiated.  True, she accepted and completed counseling under the court\u2019s diversionary program\nbefore the first May 1999 charges covering assault and property damage were dismissed.  Her\nexplanations, though, if believed by the court provide considerable provocation for her hurling a\nsmall stone at the family vehicle.  The proven conduct in this first 1999 incident does not match the\ncharges, and these dismissed charges remain for the most part unsubstantiated as well.  \nApplicant may rely on MC 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) of the\nguidelines for criminal conduct.  The arrests by themselves are insufficient to warrant continuing\nsecurity concerns about her judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Her first line supervisor and\ncolleagues hold her in high esteem and value her team work and professionalism over a considerable\nperiod of time.  These collective impressions of Applicant speak positively of her character.  So, both\nfrom a consideration of the applicable guidelines and from a whole person perspective, Applicant\nmeets all of the minimum requirements for continued eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Taking\ninto account all of the facts and circumstances developed in the record, favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nE2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant has a history of past due debts dating to the sworn statement he provided in May\n2001. His divorce in 2003 provides some extenuation for these debts. But, the extenuation is\nsubstantially reduced by his deliberate omission of these debts and two more recent judgments from\nhis security form in May 2005. Except for the unsuccessful attempt to obtain a loan in January 2007,\nApplicant\u2019s other testimonial claims about disputing some debts and establishing a repayment\nschedule for others lack credibility and/or corroboration. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn April 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as revised by Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) made effective on September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant. The SOR indicated that based on financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal\nconduct (Guideline E), DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct\nproceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. On\nApril 27, 2007, Applicant provided his response to the SOR and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 5, 2007. On July 10, 2007, this case was set for hearing\non August 14, 2007. The Government submitted eight exhibits. Applicant testified. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on August 29, 2007. \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to the amend the SOR by adding the following\nallegation: \u201c1.f. You failed to file state and federal tax returns for 2005 and 2006\u201d (Tr. 108).\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion is granted. The law requires all taxpayers file state and federal tax\nreturns or extensions even if they are unable to pay taxes, and even though they have sufficient\nwithholding taxes removed from their wages throughout the year. Applicant did not file returns for\nthe years in issue. His failure to furnish the record with extensions he said he filed establishes a\nreasonable inference he filed no extensions for 2005 and 2006. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR has five allegations under the financial guideline. Applicant admitted the first two\nsubparagraphs and denied the last three. He denied all three subparagraphs cited under the personal\nconduct guideline. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He was married in 1985, separated in 1990, and divorced in 2003.\n\n3\nHe joined the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1979, and received an Honorable Discharge in\n1999. \nFinancial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began around the time he got\nmarried. (Tr. 126) He also realized he was living beyond his means when he left the service in 1999.\nIn addition, the legal fees and other costs associated with his divorce following departure from the\nservice aggravated his long-standing financial problems. \nAfter examining his sworn statement (GE 8), Applicant recognized the 1.e. creditor\n($713.00), and admitted the debt. (Tr. 45) With regard to the 1.d. creditor ($142.00), Applicant\nclaimed he owed nothing on his telephone when it was stolen, and he indicated he sent a letter to the\ncreditor advising that he was not responsible for any charges.  \nApplicant claims he owes nothing to the landlord in 1.c. He claims that three months before\nhis lease terminated, he dutifully notified the landlord he would be terminating his lease. Moreover,\nthe landlord supposedly handed him documentation stating he owed nothing. This documentation\nwas not produced at the hearing. \nApplicant admits two judgments were entered against him as alleged in 1.a. and 1.b. He was\ninvolved in an automobile accident (1.a.), and a judgment ($8,655.00) was entered against him in\nSeptember 2003. Applicant claims his insurance company was required to pay the judgment, but\ninstead went out of business. \nA judgment (1.b.) was entered against Applicant in July 2003 for $12,191.00. Applicant did\nnot provide a clear explanation of how and why the insurance debt became a judgment. Applicant\ntestified he made four payments of $150.00 a month on the judgment, but then petitioned the\ninsurance company in 2006 to acquiesce to a reduction of payments. (Tr. 67) Applicant is no longer\nmaking payments on the judgment.\nApplicant did not file state and federal tax returns for the 2005 and 2006, but claimed he had\nfiled his returns in previous years. Applicant could provide no reason for not filing the returns. \nDuring examination of Applicant by Department Counsel, Applicant stated he sent letters\nto the listed creditors. In 1.f., he claimed he filed extensions for both tax years. In 1.e., 1.d., and 1.c.,\nhe recalled sending letters explaining why he did not owe the debts. Applicant also claimed he sent\na letter to the 1.a. creditor requesting that a payment plan be established. Regarding his past due debt\nto the insurance company identified in 1.b, Applicant indicated he had documentation substantiating\nthe four payments he made, and also documentation supporting his request to reduce the payments.\nThe record remained open for the submission of potentially confirming documents identified by\nApplicant during his testimony. No documentation was provided. \nIn an effort to repay the overdue debts and judgments, Applicant applied for aa $25,000.00\nloan in January 2007. The application was denied. Applicant sent the loan application to DOHA (GE\n6) in response to GE 5 (interrogatories, undated) to show his efforts to resolve his delinquent debts.\n(Tr. 98-101) \nGE 8 reflects debt problems in May 2001 even with a monthly remainder of approximately\n\n4\n$774.00, according to Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS). Presently, Applicant has no\ndiscretionary money remaining after his bills are paid each month. (Tr. 104) \nPersonal Conduct. On May 17, 2005, Applicant signed a security clearance application\n(SCA). His signature constituted a certification that all information he supplied in the SCA was true\nto the best of his knowledge. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 37 (judgments in last 7 years that\nhave not ben paid), 38 (over 180 days delinquent on any debt in the last 7 years), and 39 (are you\ncurrently 90 days delinquent on any debt). I find Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by not\nsupplying the requested information. His explanations of misreading the SCA and/or not\nproofreading the form are not credible. Applicant filled out three similar forms in the past (Tr. 85),\nso he knew the kinds of questions asked on the form. He also knew the purpose of the form and\nrealized the government would be evaluating the forms closely in assessing security suitability. (Tr.\n86) The only major mistakes Applicant made on the form were in response to the financial questions,\ninformation the government should know before deciding whether security clearance access should\nbe awarded. \nPOLICIES\nThe AG contains disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should\nbe given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations. These conditions must\nbe considered in every case along with the general factors of the whole person concept. However,\nthe conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case nor can they supersede\nthe Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F)\nThe failure to payment debts in a timely manner places an individual at risk of committing\nacts of poor judgment to generate funds.\nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E)\n\n5\nThe security concern is that conduct involving questionable judgment or dishonesty could\nindicate the individual may not properly safeguard classified information. \nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations (FC). Applicant recalled that his financial problems began around\nthe time he was married in 1985. Though he provided very little detail of the nature of his financial\ntrouble in period of 1985 to 1999, Applicant reiterated the existence of financial problems in 1999\nwhen he had to hire an attorney to defend his divorce litigation. In July and September 2003, two\njudgments were filed for almost $21,000.00. Applicant still owes those judgments. The four\nremaining debts have not been resolved either. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) applies due to Applicant\u2019s inability to pay the enumerated debts and\njudgments. Because of the age of the debts and judgments, FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) is also applicable. Finally, Applicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns for 2005 and\n2006 supports the application of FC DC 19.g. (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same) \nThe facts have been carefully evaluated to determine whether one or more of the mitigating\nconditions (MC) apply. FC MC 20.a. (the behavior occurred so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply due to the overdue\nstatus of the debts and the ongoing failure of Applicant to resolve the debts. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol). Applicant\u2019s divorce in 2003 entitles him to limited mitigation and extenuation. Greater\nweight cannot be assigned to the divorce as it occurred in 2003, almost four years ago, and without\nany documented action to resolve the debts since then. The only documented action relating to the\ndebts and judgments is Applicant\u2019s SCA where he intentionally concealed the debts in his May 2005\nSCA. \nThe lack of counseling precludes the application of FC MC 20.c. (the person has received\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control) FC MC 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) does not apply to the\njudgments or the collection debts. I have weighed and balanced Applicant\u2019s positions with respect\nto the listed obligations. Even though he has provided several reasons for not paying the debts, I am\nunable to agree that he has a bona fide dispute with any of the creditors. All subparagraphs under the\nFC guideline are found against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct (PC). Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of material information from his\nsecurity form in May 2005 falls within the ambit of PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness) Applicant intentionally concealed information about his judgments and\ndebts from his SCA. Negligence or haste can sometimes cause a person to unintentionally leave out\nrelevant information from a security form. However, Applicant had filled these forms out before. He\n\n6\nknew the government evaluated the responses on the form to determine security clearance eligibility.\nSignificantly, the only material omissions on Applicant\u2019s SCA are omissions to questions dealing\nwith overdue debts and judgments. Finally, Applicant continues to deny he falsified the form.\nThe mitigating conditions have been considered, however, none apply based on Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent position he did not falsify the form. PC MC 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not apply.\nPC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent,\nor it happened under the such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not qualify under the\ncircumstances due to Applicant\u2019s continuing belief he did not intentionally omit information. The\nonly mitigating condition remaining is PC MC 17.e. (the individual has take positive steps to reduce\nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) Continuing to claim the\ninformation was unintentionally omitted does not constitute positive action by Applicant to eliminate\nhis vulnerability to duress and manipulation. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omissions have not been\nmitigated. Subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. are found against Applicant. \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient portion of a person\u2019s life to make\na determination about the person\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant realizes he began to have\nfinancial problems as early as 1985. When he was discharged from the military, his financial\nproblems got worse when he had to hire an attorney to litigate his divorce. The SOR reflects\nApplicant\u2019s financial dilemma has not changed. There has been no documented effort to address his\ndebt. With no financial counseling and no real plan to handle his judgments and overdue debts,\nApplicant\u2019s debt entanglements are likely to remain for some time. After a careful evaluation of\nthese facts in the context of the whole person model, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden\nof persuasion under the FC and AC guidelines.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph f.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He also used marijuana more than 100 times from\n1971 to at least 1983 and at least three times in March 1998 while he held a security clearance. He\ncultivated marijuana in March 1998 and was arrested for cultivation as well as possession. On\nsecurity clearance applications completed in June 1984 and June 1991, he reported limited marijuana\ninvolvement (used only a couple times, \u201ctried\u201d it) in 1982. Criminal Conduct, Personal Conduct, and\nDrug Involvement concerns persist where he shows little appreciation for his obligation of candor\nand justifies his use and cultivation of marijuana. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on September 22, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on October 6,\n2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to\nAdministrative Judge Charles Ablard on January 16, 2007, and transferred to me due to workload\nconsiderations on March 26, 2007. Counsel for Applicant entered his appearance on April 26, 2007.\nWith the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on April 27, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Of  the nine Government exhibits identified for the record, seven were admitted (Exhibits\n1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 over Applicant\u2019s objection). Proposed exhibit 2 was withdrawn. Applicant\u2019s\nobjection to Exhibit 9, a report of investigation, was sustained due to lack of an authenticating\nwitness pursuant of \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive. Applicant testified on his behalf and submitted two\nstate statutes (Ex. A and B) for consideration. At the request of the Government, the parties agreed\nto submit closing argument in writing. Department Counsel submitted his closing on May 14, 2007.1\nApplicant\u2019s counsel filed his closing argument on May 24, 2007. A transcript of the hearing was\nreceived by me on May 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from at least 1971 to at least\n1983 and in at least March 1998 (\u00b6 1.a), cultivated marijuana in at least 1998 (\u00b6 1.b), was arrested\nin about March 1982 for possession of marijuana (\u00b6 1.c) and in March 1998 for cultivation and\npossession of marijuana (\u00b6 1.d), and that Applicant continued to smoke marijuana after he had been\n\nThe Government alleged in \u00b6 1.c that the charge was dismissed at arraignment. It is not clear where the\n2\nGovernment got that information. Applicant indicated on his 2004 SF 86 (Ex. 1) that he had been given a three months\nsuspended sentence.\n3\ngranted a SECRET clearance (\u00b6 1.e). Applicant was alleged under Guideline E to have falsified his\nJune 1984 (\u00b6 2.a) and June 1991 (\u00b6 2.b) security clearance applications by disclosing marijuana use\nonly in 1982, and to have used marijuana while he had a clearance (\u00b6 2.c). DOHA alleged under\nGuideline J the 1982 marijuana possession (\u00b6 3.a) and 1998 marijuana cultivation and possession\n(\u00b6 3.d) offenses, a 1983 criminal trespass offense (\u00b63.b), drunk driving offenses in November 1987,\nAugust 1991, and February 1992 (\u00b6 3.c), a December 2003 arrest for driving while intoxicated\n(convicted of reckless driving) (\u00b6 3.e), and a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 for not fully disclosing\nhis drug usage on his clearance applications (\u00b6 3.f). In addition to including the alcohol-related\narrests in November 1987, August 1991, February 1992, and December 2003 (\u00b6\u00b6 4.b, 4.c, 4.d, and\n4.e), DOHA alleged under Guideline G that Applicant consumed alcohol at times to intoxication\nfrom approximately 1970 to at least 2003 (\u00b6 4.a).\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the use, cultivation, and drug-related arrests as alleged,\nbut claimed his cultivation was \u201can experiment for biology class.\u201d He denied the intentional\nfalsification of his security clearance application (\u201cI was not aware that I had to list every single use\nof marijuana.\u201d). He admitted that he drank at times to intoxication and had been arrested as alleged\nalthough noted that the August 1991, February 1992, and December 2003 charges had been\ndismissed.\nAfter consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old senior designer who has worked for his current employer (defense\ncontractor X) as a direct hire since February 1984. He had worked  for an outside contractor at the\nfacility from June 1983 until he was hired as a full-time employee. Applicant seeks to retain the\nSECRET security clearance that he has held since November 1984.\nApplicant began drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana as a teenager. A caddy at a local\ncountry club in 1970, he consumed a quart of beer on three occasions that summer. He continued to\ndrink beer, sometimes wine, on holidays through high school. From 1975 to 1983, he drank beer in\nquantity of a six-pack at keg parties with friends, occasionally to intoxication. He smoked marijuana\nfrom 1971 to 1983, varying from weekly to monthly when out with his friends at street corners or\nat keg parties, although there were times when he refrained from using marijuana, such as when he\nwas playing basketball during his sophomore year of high school. Applicant estimates he smoked\nit more than 100 but fewer than 200 times during that 12-year time span. The drug was provided free\nat first, but he eventually bought it at $5 per quarter ounce. In March 1982, he was arrested for\nmarijuana possession (\u201ctwo marijuana roaches in the bag,\u201d Tr. 134), and given a three-month\nsentence (suspended).  Applicant enjoyed marijuana when he used it, but stopped in 1983 as he tired\n2\nof it.\nIn June 1983, Applicant relocated for his contract job at his present place of employment. On\ncomplaint of a security officer employed by the defense contractor, Applicant was arrested for\ncriminal trespass on December 18, 1983, after he and a companion were observed climbing the\n\n4\ncenter mast of a docked ship at around 3:35 a.m. He had consumed a few beers and did not consider\nthat he was on private property. Applicant was placed on accelerated rehabilitation.\n In February 1984, he was hired as a full-time senior draftsman by the defense contracting\nfirm, and given a company-granted CONFIDENTIAL clearance. In about June 1984, he was told to\nfill out an application for a SECRET clearance and to complete it to the best of his ability. On the\nPersonnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ) that he executed on June 26, 1984, he listed an arrest for\npossession of marijuana on February 2, 1982, in response to question 14.a concerning whether he\nhad ever been arrested. He also responded affirmatively to questions 15.a [\u201cHave you ever used any\nnarcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP) or Cannabis (to include\nmarijuana or hashish) except as prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d] and 15.b [\u201cHave you ever been\ninvolved in the illegal purchase, possession, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant,\nhallucinogen, or Cannabis?\u201d], but indicated only that he smoked marijuana \u201ca couple times\u201d and\nbought a couple of marijuana cigarettes from a friend, both the use and purchase occurring on\napproximately February 2, 1982.  Applicant was granted his SECRET clearance on November 24,\n1984.\nApplicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol increased after he started working for the defense\ncontractor. In November 1987, he was stopped for weaving, although Applicant contends he was lost\nand looking for a street sign. After a breathalyser showed a .11% blood alcohol content, he was\narrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). He was placed in an accelerated rehabilitation program.\nOn completion of one year probation and attendance at alcohol awareness classes at a cost to him\nof $260, the charge was dismissed.\nIn May 1988, Applicant totaled his vehicle in a one-car accident. He had consumed a few\nbeers before the arrest, but attributed the accident to driving too fast for road conditions. He reduced\nhis consumption of alcohol to three or four beers weekly, in part because of the expense of drinking.\nApplicant\u2019s medical insurance had lapsed and he incurred almost $6,000 in medical expenses from\nthe accident that he had to pay.\nIn renewal of his SECRET clearance, Applicant executed a National Agency Questionnaire\n(NAQ) on June 21, 1991. Applicant signed a typewritten form that included \u201cNO\u201d responses to\nquestion 18, concerning whether he had ever been arrested, and question 20.a, concerning whether\nhe had ever tried or use or possessed any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis,\n\u201ceven on a one-time or on an experimental basis.\u201d On a two-page attachment, Applicant responded\n\u201cYes\u201d to the arrest record (question 18), illegal drug use (question 20.a), and alcohol use (question\n20.b) inquiries. He listed arrests in December 1982 for possession of marijuana and November 1987\nfor DWI. Applicant added with respect to the drug use, \u201cI tried marijuana in 1982. It was given to\nme by a friend. I got caught with it in my possession.\u201d As for his DWI, Applicant stated, \u201cI just made\na mistake to do someone a favor and drive them home after I had a couple of drinks.\u201d\nIn August 1991, Applicant was stopped by the state police after he was observed driving in\nand out of the breakdown lane. He was given field sobriety tests and charged with operating under\nthe influence (OUI). Applicant was found not guilty in November 1991. Applicant submits he had\nnothing to drink before his arrest on that occasion and the Government presented no evidence to\nrebut his statement.\n\nApplicant claims he smoked the marijuana only to see if his experiment worked. Asked why he had to smoke\n3\nit three times if that was his purpose, Applicant responded, \u201cCause there was [sic] three plants.\u201d (Tr. 162)\n5\nIn November 1991, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special\nagent, in part about his alcohol and illegal drug use and related arrests. Applicant admitted he had\nbeen placed on probation and required to attend an alcohol awareness class for the November 1987\nDWI, but denied that he had been weaving (\u201call I was doing was looking for a street sign and street\nI would recognize.\u201d). Applicant denied he had been drinking on the occasion of his recent arrest for\nOUI in August 1991. He admitted he had been fined for possession of marijuana in 1982 and for\ntrespassing in 1983. Applicant detailed his consumption of about a six-pack of beer at keg parties\nwith friends from 1975 to 1983 and in increased amounts after he began work with the defense\ncontractor until his accident. Applicant indicated that he had since reduced his drinking to three to\nfour beers weekly. He also admitted he had smoked marijuana weekly to twice monthly from 1971\nto 1983, but stopped when he got tired of it. Applicant averred he had \u201cno intention to use, sell,\nmanufacture, purchase or possess mj [sic] or any other illegal drugs now or in the future.\u201d \nApplicant was arrested in February 1992 for DWI. The charge was dismissed. Applicant\ndenies he had been drinking before his arrest and there is no evidence of record proving he had been\nintoxicated on that occasion.\nApplicant attended a local college from about 1997 to 2003, earning credits toward his\nbachelor\u2019s degree in nursing. He was unable to complete the clinical requirements due to his full-\ntime job with the defense contractor so stopped pursuing that degree. Applicant was disciplined at\nwork for storing some of his academic product on his work computer.\nIn March 1998, Applicant was charged with cultivation and possession of marijuana in his\napartment. He had been cultivating the plants from about December 1997 from seeds he claims he\nfound in a bag on the property. Applicant presumed that a firefighter, who had accessed his\napartment without his permission to repair a problem on the premises, had tipped off the local police.\nApplicant was sentenced to 80 hours of community service on the marijuana possession charge.\nApplicant, who had returned to college, claims he had cultivated the marijuana as a personal (i.e.,\nnot school sponsored) biology experiment (\u201cit actually demonstrated a lot of the principles that are\nused in reproduction for sexual plants. Genetics. It demonstrated lighting, all the use of fertilizer,\nchemicals, and stuff like this.\u201d Tr. 93). On at least three occasions before his arrest, Applicant\nsmoked some of the marijuana he had cultivated.  He did not destroy the plants after he smoked the\n3\nmarijuana. He has not used any marijuana since his arrest. He was aware his conduct was illegal but\nhe did not consider it serious (\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t even consider it to be an infringement on my secret\nclearance.\u201d Tr. 125).\nOn December 12, 2003, Applicant was stopped at a sobriety checkpoint and arrested for DWI\nafter a field sobriety test. He was prosecuted for, and convicted of, misdemeanor reckless driving in\n\nState criminal history records reflect Applicant was charged and convicted of reckless driving. (Ex. 6) Had\n4\nApplicant been charged with operating while under the influence or while having an elevated blood content (.08% or\nmore), the prosecution would have been required to state in open court the reason for the reduction to misdemeanor\nreckless driving. Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-227a. The available criminal record does not indicate that the reckless driving\ncharge was reduced from DWI.\n6\nApril 2004.  His operator\u2019s license was suspended and he was fined. Applicant denies he had been\n4\ndrinking before his arrest, and there is no proof he was drunk.\nIn an update of his SECRET clearance, Applicant executed a security clearance application\n(SF 86) on October 28, 2004. In response to question 24 concerning alcohol/drug offenses, Applicant\nlisted the following arrests and convictions:  January [vice March] 1982 for possession of marijuana,\nthree-month suspended sentence; February 1988 [vice November 1987] DWI, driving school; August\n1990 [vice 1991] DWI, not guilty after trial; March 1998 cultivation and possession of marijuana,\ncharges dismissed; December 2003 DWI, charges dismissed\u2014traffic violation. In response to\nquestion 27 concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years and to question 28 concerning any\nillegal drug use while possessing a security clearance, Applicant indicated he used marijuana in\nMarch 1998 three times.\nApplicant considers himself an avid reader and stock trader as well as a music historian. He\nreads two, sometimes three newspapers a day. He testified that if he could afford it, he would resume\nacademic studies, probably in music. He denies any current association with known drug users or\nthat he had  criminal intent when he cultivated the marijuana in 1998. Applicant denies that he had\nany intent to falsify his earlier security clearance application or that he consumes alcohol to the\nextent where he is not in control. His most recent consumption was over the weekend before his\nhearing when he consumed two or three beers. In the past year, Applicant has consumed as many as\nfive beers at home but he did not drive.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\n\nApplicant had no reasonable explanation for retaining the plants once he had tested the fruits of his\n5\n\u201cexperiment\u201d (\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know. It was like remnants of it in the pot. No particular reason.\u201d). He subsequently\nadmitted he had kept some marijuana leaves in the top of a box. Asked why he kept those leaves once he tested the plant,\nApplicant responded, \u201cThere as no particular reason; was just still there.\u201d (Tr. 165-66)\n7\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H\u2014Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(AG \u00b6 24) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs, materials,\nand other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). (\u00b6\n24(a)(1)) The use of a controlled substance such as marijuana is considered drug abuse under the\nDirective (\u00b6 24(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug). Drug involvement disqualifying\nconditions (DC) \u00b6 25(a) any drug abuse, \u00b6 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, and\n\u00b6 25(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance, apply.  Applicant smoked\nmarijuana on more than 100 occasions during the 1981 to 1983 time frame, continuing to use the\ndrug after he was convicted of a March 1982 illegal possession offense. More recently, while in\npossession of a SECRET clearance and employed by a defense contractor, he cultivated marijuana\nfrom December 1997 until he was arrested in March 1998 on charges of cultivation and possession.\nHe smoked the product of his cultivation at least three times in about March 1998, and did not\ndestroy the plants after he smoked (Tr. 165), casting doubt on his claim that it was grown solely for\na biology experiment (\u201cIt was purely an experiment, that I still regret.\u201d Tr. 128).5\nThe Government presented no evidence to rebut Applicant\u2019s claim of a last use of marijuana\nin March 1998. Yet despite his limited involvement in the past 20 years, mitigating condition (MC)\n\u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, does not apply. Applicant did not just happen to be\nat a social function in 1998 and accept an offer of marijuana passed to him. He exercised extremely\npoor judgment over about a four-month period when he brought the marijuana seeds to germination\nand eventually enjoyed the fruits of his illegal labors. By his own admission, his \u201cexperiment\u201d was\npersonal and had not been sanctioned by lawful authority.\nA demonstrated intent to refrain from any future illicit drug use may yet mitigate the security\nconcerns presented by illegal drug involvement, although Applicant bears a heavy burden in this\nregard given, if he is to be believed, he used, possessed, and cultivated marijuana after about 15 years\nof no involvement. Under MC \u00b6 26(b), among the factors that may demonstrate that intent are:  (1)\ndisassociation from drug using associates and contacts, (2) changing or avoiding the environment\n\n8\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent\nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. While he now expresses regret over his\ncultivation and use in 1998, and denies any ongoing association with drug users, I am unable to\naffirmatively conclude that his drug use is safely in the past. There is no evidence that he was\nassociating with, or influenced by, other drug users when he decided to cultivate marijuana in\n1997/98. His regret is likely in getting caught, rather than in cultivating the marijuana, as he shows\nlittle appreciation for the illegality of his conduct (\u201cyou know, smoking pot or whatever this\u2013you\nknow\u2013hasn\u2019t hindered my life or made it a turmoil of neglect.\u201d Tr. 127), and continues to justify his\nbehavior:\nI used it as a biology experiment between Biology 1 and Biology 2, and it actually\ndemonstrated a lot of the principles that are used in reproduction for sexual plants.\nGenetics. It demonstrated lighting, all the use of fertilizer, chemicals, and stuff like\nthis. \nSo it was an experiment that, to this day, I regret that I had ever done. And\nthat\u2019s\u2013you\u2019re going to say why did I smoke it? Well, I guess the real reason was to\nsee if the experiment worked. And obviously, I\u2019ll never live it down. (Tr. 93)\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for growing the marijuana as opposed to another plant (\u201cAgain, it\u2019s a sexual\nplant. You can\u2019t do it with cactus or tomatoes, for instance. You can do it with corn but you can\u2019t\ngrow corn indoors.\u201d Tr. 154) does not excuse his illegal conduct. His denial of any intent to use\nmarijuana in the future is not  persuasive since he cultivated marijuana from late 1997 to March 1998\nand smoked it in March 1998, after he had told a DSS agent in November 1991 that he had no intent\nto use, sell, manufacture, purchase or possess marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. In addition to the judgment concerns raised\nby Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while he held a SECRET clearance (see Guideline H, infra), the\nGovernment submits Applicant was less than fully candid about his illegal drug use on the security\nclearance applications completed for his initial SECRET clearance in June 1984 and on renewal of\nthat clearance in June 1991. The evidence shows Applicant responded affirmatively to the drug use\ninquiries, but he disclosed on his June 1984 PSQ only that he had used marijuana \u201ca couple times\u201d\non approximately February 2, 1982, on his June 1991 NAQ that he had \u201ctried marijuana in 1982.\n. . and got caught with it in [his] possession.\u201d Applicant admits he used marijuana more than 100\ntimes from 1971 to 1983, and attributes the substantial under reporting to the lack of assistance in\nfilling out the first questionnaire (Tr. 76), to not being aware that they wanted to know every single\nusage of marijuana in his history (Tr. 77), to his employer not taking drug use seriously:\nI think that\u2019s also a particular reason why I didn\u2019t call attention to it on the\napplication, is because they never called a serious attention to it because of the fact\nthat most of the employees that worked in the yard used it on the property of\n\nApplicant\u2019s counsel argued in closing that Applicant was never given the detailed instructions. Applicant\n6\ntestified he was given the application, and because he answered yes to use of marijuana, \u201ca couple blank sheets of paper\nand an envelope, to fill out, to the best of [his] ability, what [he] thought [he] should put down as far as [his] usage.\u201d (Tr.\n76) Whether or not he was given any detailed instructions, he falsely certified that his answer was \u201ctrue, complete, and\naccurate.\u201d\n9\n[company name omitted], and I saw no, no actual importance to them for the usage.\nThe park lot had all the people in the yard drinking, smoking pot out there. So how\nwas I supposed to know that that [sic] was so important to them, every single use?\nI just didn\u2019t see it. (Tr. 84, see also Tr. 92-93, 147)\nHe also attributed his responses to the security clearance applications themselves (\u201cNo one\u2013it wasn\u2019t\nan issue before. It wasn\u2019t outlined like it is now\u2013every\u2013how many times exactly? You know, it\u2019s\nmuch more intense now, the questionnaires.\u201d Tr. 92). Concerning his 1991 NAQ, Applicant\nintimated that he was merely updating the information provided from the previous application (Tr.\n144). When it was pointed out to him that he had indicated that he had \u201ctried marijuana,\u201d Applicant\nindicated it was \u201ca generality\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say they tried things, after doing \u2018em a 100 times,\nand they\u2019re talking about having to do something.\u201d Tr. 146).\nWhile a good-faith mistake as to what was required could negate the willful intent required\nfor application of \u00b6 16 (a)  deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, his denials of any\nintentional misrepresentation are not convincing. Applicant was asked on question 15.a of the PSQ\nwhether he had used any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis except as\nprescribed by a licensed physician, applicants, and directed to explain any \u201cYes\u201d answer in accord\nwith the detailed instructions. Although those detailed instructions are not of record,  he certified that\n6\nhis responses were \u201ctrue, complete, and accurate to the best of [his] knowledge and belief.\u201d Having\nused marijuana more than 100 times, it was clearly misleading for Applicant to state, \u201cI have smoked\nmarijuana a couple times.\u201d Similarly, Applicant\u2019s response on his June 1991 NAQ, \u201cI tried\nmarijuana in 1982,\u201d leads one to falsely conclude that his use of marijuana was experimental or\nlimited to only a few occasions at or around the time of his arrest in 1982.\nTo his credit, Applicant disclosed his drug use when he was interviewed by a DSS agent in\nNovember 1991. He admitted he had enjoyed marijuana weekly to twice monthly between 1971 and\n1983. The Guideline E concerns raised by his knowing falsification of his security clearance\napplications may be mitigated by a prompt good-faith effort at rectification (see \u00b6 17(a) the\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts). Applicant maintains he volunteered the information (\u201cI\nvoluntarily gave him everything he wanted to know in most cases. He didn\u2019t even ask questions. I\njust told him.\u201d Tr.79), but it appears that the admissions of drug abuse were in response to direct\ninquiry from the agent (\u201cHe says, Are these, in fact, the only times that you used it? I says no, it\u2019s\nnot.\u201d Tr. 78; \u201cHe asked, so I told him.\u201d Tr. 92). Whether or not he volunteered the information up-\nfront, his rectification in November 1991 was not reasonably prompt with respect to the 1984 false\nstatement.\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides in part:\n7\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and\nwillfully: (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes\nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false\nwriting or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n10\nMitigation is available where so much time has passed that it is unlikely to recur (see \u00b6 17\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Although it has now been about 16\nyears since he made a false statement on his 1991 security clearance application, his denial of any\nintentional falsification of his 1991 and 1984 clearance applications casts continuing doubt on his\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. There is no pertinent mitigating condition for his\ncultivation of marijuana while he held a SECRET clearance and in knowing disregard of the laws\nagainst such drug involvement.\nCriminal Conduct\u2014Guideline J\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. AG \u00b6 30. Applicant has been arrested at least seven times since 1982, most recently\nfor DWI in December 2003. The Government can consider criminal conduct that has been dismissed\nby a court (see DC \u00b6 31(c), allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted), but not all the charges have been\nsufficiently substantiated to warrant an inference that he engaged in the criminal conduct charged.\nCulpability was proven with respect to the March 1982 possession of marijuana (\u00b6 2.a), the\nDecember 1983 criminal trespass (\u00b6 3.b), the November 1987 DWI (\u00b6 3.c), the March 1998\ncultivation and possession of marijuana (\u00b6 3.d), and the December 2003 reckless driving (\u00b6 3.e).  DC\n\u00b6 31(a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and DC \u00b6 31(c) apply because of these\noffenses. Furthermore, Guideline J DC \u00b6 31(c) is also implicated because of his lack of candor on\nhis security clearance application (see Personal Conduct, supra). Applicant committed a felony\nviolation of \u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately omitting relevant information concerning his illegal\ndrug involvement from his 1984 PSQ and his 1991 NAQ.  However, no negative inferences are\n7\nwarranted because of his arrest for OUI in August 1991 where he was found not guilty or his arrest\nin February 1992 for DWI that was dismissed (see MC \u00b6 32(c) evidence that the person did not\ncommit the offense). Applicant testified as to the latter that he thinks he received a traffic ticket, but\nhe never saw the ticket. (Tr. 149)\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct includes drug offenses, deliberate false statements, drunk\ndriving, and misdemeanor reckless driving, all but the first offense occurring after he relocated to\nhis present locale to work as an outside contractor for his present employer. Only the March 1982\nDWI and December 1983 criminal trespass offenses were committed before he became a direct\nemployee of the defense firm. In evaluating his criminal conduct as a whole, I cannot favorably\nconsider MC \u00b6 31(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\n\n11\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has not successfully mitigated the security concerns raised by his repeated\ndisregard of the law in several different areas. He remains unwilling to accept responsibility for\nmaking a false statement on two security clearance questionnaires. He has also not credibly\ndemonstrated that he can be counted on to refrain from all illegal drug involvement in the future.\nApplicant\u2019s contributions to his employer over the past 20 years are appropriately considered in his\nfavor (see \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage to time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement), but it is also noted\nthat he apparently was disciplined in about 2005 for storing personal academic data on his work\ncomputer.\nGuideline G\u2014Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. Applicant admits he drank at times to intoxication from approximately\n1970 to at least 2003, and he was caught driving drunk in November 1987 DWI. Drunk driving is\npotentially security disqualifying (see \u00b6 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent). The government failed to prove that Applicant was legally intoxicated on any\nof the three subsequent occasions when he was arrested for drunk driving. Although Applicant has\nconsumed as many as five beers over the course of four hours, he did not drive after drinking in that\nquantity. The Government did not present any evidence of a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or\ndependence where drinking five beers could present a problem. With the evidence of abusive\ndrinking limited in this case, I find MC 23(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, applies.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). During\nhis teens and into his mid-twenties, Applicant used marijuana with some frequency. Although he\nshowed good judgment in stopping his illegal drug use, he lied about his involvement in 1984 to gain\na SECRET clearance. While holding a fiduciary position with the Government by virtue of his\nclearance, he was caught driving drunk at age 31, lied on his second clearance application at age 37,\ncultivated and used marijuana when he was in his early 40s, and drove recklessly when he was 47\n(\u00b6 2(a)(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \u00b6 2(a)(3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; \u00b6 2(a)(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct). Applicant has\nnot shown reform (\u00b6 2(a)(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes) of the Drug Involvement, Personal Conduct, and Criminal Conduct concerns\nwhere he externalizes blame (others were using drugs and his employer looked the other way, had\n\n12\nno help in filling out his clearance applications) and attempts to justify his misconduct (drug\ncultivation as a biology experiment).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.
