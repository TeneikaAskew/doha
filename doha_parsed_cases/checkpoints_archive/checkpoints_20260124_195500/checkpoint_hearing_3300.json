She graduated from high \nschool in June 2010. Applicant attended a technical school in May 2011, and she received \na diploma with a concentration in Pharmacy Technician. She has worked for her current \nemployer as an IT specialist since February 2021. (Item 7) She served in the active duty \nmilitary U.S. Navy from October 2013 to December 2013. She received an honorable \ndischarge. (medical separation) Applicant reported some unemployment in 2013, and \nJuly 2010 to April 2011.

(Items 4, 5, 6)  The delinquent debts \ninclude consumer accounts, medical accounts, and an automobile that is a charged-off-\naccount. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all but three accounts totaling \n$21,746.00. The five remaining delinquent accounts total $4,034. (Item 2) She provided \nno explanations at that time.  \nIn her 2021 subject interview, Applicant responded to questioning concerning \nApplicant\u2018s financial delinquencies on her credit reports. Applicant stated that some \naccounts were disputed, and others were paid or settled, or in a payment arrangement. \n(Item 7) She also discussed other delinquent accounts that she did not recall. Applicant \nexplained that for the remaining consumer and medical accounts listed on the SOR, she \nhad no knowledge of them. (Item 7) In essence, she provided no explanation for her \nindebtedness. She stated that she would look into all the accounts \nThere is no information in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s annual income or \nbudget. It does not appear that she has sought financial counseling. She did not report \nany circumstances beyond her control. She told the investigator that \u201cshe does not live \nbeyond her means, does not spend frivolously, and has good pay.\u201d (Item 7) She listed \nthree trips abroad for tourism on her SCA. The trips occurred in 2017, 2018, and 2019. \n(Item 3) \nAs to SOR 1.a, a medical account for collection in the amount of $152, and a \nmedical account in SOR 1.b, for $130, Applicant claimed that they were both paid. She \nprovided documentation regarding both accounts showing she paid the amounts due on \nJune 6, 2022 with a credit card. (Response to FORM) \nAs to SOR 1.c, a collection account in the amount of $401, Applicant disputed this \naccount and provided documentation that the account was researched and deleted from \nApplicant\u2019s credit report. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, a past-due account in the amount of $2,729, with a total balance \nof $29,349, Applicant stated that the account was removed from her credit report due to \na reporting error. \nAs to SOR 1.e, Applicant admitted that this charged-off account for a vehicle in the \namount of $20,830, is not resolved. Applicant claimed that she is saving and working with \na credit specialist to reach a settlement agreement. (Response to FORM) She did not \nprovide documentation. \nAs to SOR 1.f, a collection account for a cell phone in the amount of $622, \nApplicant stated that it was settled for $249. She at first disputed the account. Applicant \nprovided an agreement but it does not show that any amounts were paid. (Response to \nFORM) \nAs to SOR 1.g, a medical account in the amount of $521, Applicant admitted the \ndebt in her answer but in her investigative interview, she stated that she had no idea what \nit was and then in her FORM response she stated that it had been removed from her \ncredit report. She did not provide any receipt for payment. \nAs to SOR 1.h, a medical account in the amount of $395, she admitted the \ndelinquent account and in her Response to FORM that it had been removed from her \ncredit report. \nApplicant acknowledged her delinquent debts and takes responsibility and wants \nto resolve them to the best of her ability. She loves the last eight years that she has \nworked at DOD. She states that she pays her taxes, has no criminal history and fulfills \nher contractual duties at work. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and, \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) . \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has unresolved delinquent debts that are \nnot paid. The debts are recent. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant reported no circumstances beyond her \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation of obtaining financial counseling or evidence of any good-faith efforts to \nshow what she has done to address the debts. She disputed one debt and that was \nremoved from her credit report. That is not sufficient mitigation in this case. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR due to insufficient evidence and documentation. For these reasons, I find she has \nnot mitigated the security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply in \nthis case. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s military service, I conclude that Applicant has \nnot presented evidence of mitigation under the financial considerations guideline. \nClearance is denied. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n\u00b6 1, Guideline F Financial Considerations):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1:a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n   Conclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information under the financial consideration \nguideline.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. Applicant responded to the \nSOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on April 13, 2022.

The case \nwas assigned to me on July 11, 2022. Based on my review of the documentary \nevidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 31 years-old, divorced, and has no children. (Item 8) He served in \nthe U.S. Air Force from February 2012 to May 2018, receiving a General Discharge in \nMay 2018. (Items 5, 9) He completed a security clearance application on February 27, \n2020. (Item 5) He has held a security clearance since 2011. Applicant has worked for \nhis current employer since October 2019. (Item 5) \nFinancial \nThe SOR from February 2022, alleges that Applicant has six delinquent debts \ntotaling over $26,000. (Item 1) The allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s latest credit \nreport. He admitted all of the SOR allegations. The debts were accrued in 2018 or 2019 \nafter leaving the military. (Item 4) \nApplicant attributed the delinquent debts to his immaturity, irresponsibility, and \nunexpected discharge from the military. (Items 4, 5) He was involuntarily discharged \ndue to multiple reprimands (two Article 15\u2019s) and for arriving late to work (poor \nperformance). (Item 5) His medical records confirm that Applicant suffered from severe \ninsomnia and depression which caused him significant functional impairment. (Item 8) \nApplicant admits that he had difficulty adjusting to military life. \nAfter leaving the military, Applicant was unemployed from May 2018 to October \n2019. Since then he has been consistently employed. He disclosed his delinquent debts \non his 2020 security clearance application, acknowledging that he had not taken any \naction yet, but he would have a plan to repay his delinquent debts within the current \nfiscal year. (Item 5) During his 2020 subject interview, Applicant stated that he had \ncontacted some accounts and was waiting \u201con a negotiated payment plan.\u201d He was also \nconfronted with past delinquent accounts. (Item 9) \nApplicant responded to the FORM and stated that he had not put sufficient effort \nor attention toward fixing his credit. He did not want to resort to bankruptcy and decided \nthe responsible thing to do was to pay his debts in full. (Item 10) \nAs to SOR 1.a, a collection account in the approximate amount of $11,466, he \nconsidered disputing the account because it was caused by water damage to his \napartment. He had reported the issue before, but he was away for two weeks in 2018 \nwhile he was on active duty. (Item 4) In his response to FORM, Applicant provided \nevidence that he made three monthly payments of $3,822.10 beginning in April 2022, \nand his balance is now zero. The debt is resolved. (Item 10) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, charged-off accounts to the same creditors for a \ntotal of $13,915, in Applicant\u2019s answer he stated that they were still delinquent and \naccrued when he was on active duty. He added that he was irresponsible and flagrant \nwith his credit, but he stated that he has matured. In his answer to the FORM, Applicant \nstated that he incorrectly reported them as delinquent. He claims that they have all been \npaid. He does not recall when, but they were transferred to a collection agency and \nwere to be settled at a lower amount. (Item 10) He is looking for the receipts and asking \nthe three credit agencies to have these accounts removed from his credit report. ((Item \n10) He did not submit any documentation for his claim. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.e, a charged-off account in the amount of $801, Applicant \nacknowledged that the account was still delinquent. (Item 4) He stated in his response \nto the FORM that he cannot find the creditor to repay the account, but he stated that it \nwas from Discount Tire. Applicant noted that he would continue to search for the \ncreditor to settle the debt. (Item 10) \nAs to SOR 1.f, a collection account in the amount of $351, Applicant stated that \nthe account was delinquent and it was for a debt from college. (Item 4) In his response \nto the FORM, Applicant stated that he has repaid the balance and has enabled auto \npay, to automatically make the monthly payment so that he never misses a monthly \npayment of $103.61. Applicant submitted verification of auto pay status for an account \nthat appears to have an $8,075 balance with a payment due date of September 28, \n2022. (Item 10) \nApplicant emphasized that since he has been employed he has contributed the \nmaximum amount to a retirement account with an account value of $62,644.30 as of \nDecember 31, 2021. (Items 4, 10) He is keen on raising his credit score. However, he \nhas not made the resolution of his delinquent debts a priority. He states that he intends \nto pay all, but presented no specific plan or documentation concerning payments. He \nalso obtained a credit card and refinanced a recent auto purchase. (Item 4) \nApplicant is gainfully employed. There is no information in the record concerning \nhis income or expenses. No information concerning financial counseling was provided \nexcept that he spoke to a financial counselor. He admitted that his livelihood is \nthreatened. Applicant is actively working to recover from the havoc these debts played \non his credit score. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and his credit reports confirm, that he has delinquent debt. \nHe blames the debts on an expected military discharge and immaturity. He has not \nacted responsibly when he became gainfully employed in 2019. This does not show a \ngood-faith effort to resolve his debts. He satisfied one debt in 2022. The other \ndelinquent debts on the SOR are unresolved. He provided no evidence to prove that he \nhas a track record of paying the remaining delinquent debts. He has not sought financial \ncounseling. He is concerned about raising his credit card score instead of paying his \ndelinquent debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on the scant evidence produced by Applicant, it is impossible to conclude \nhe made a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve his debts or that his financial situation is \nunder control. He claims that he is now mature and intends to continue his efforts to \npreserve his clearance and continue his government service. I have cause to question \nwhether Applicant has his finances under control. Despite gainful employment, and \n$64,000 in his retirement account, Applicant has not submitted documentation that he \nhas resolved his delinquent debts. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the \nGovernment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 50 years old. He is married and has no children. He has a Master\u2019s degree in Information Security. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems Administrator III. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant began working for his current employer in April 2020. In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under each of the three guidelines set forth below. Guideline F: Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. In February 2020, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. (See Government Exhibit 2.) The debts listed in the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy were discharged in July 2020. A Credit report of the Applicant dated February 1, 2022, confirms this bankruptcy. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant explained that he had a seizure at work in September 2019, and lost his job. He could no longer afford to pay the household bills. (Tr. p. 68.) He is the sole financial provider of the household, as his wife does not work outside of the home. The bills discharged were mainly credit cards that he was able to pay when he was employed. Some debt that was discharged were his wife\u2019s credit",

The Applicant offered no exhibits, however, he testified on his own behalf. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 50 years old. He is married and has no children. He has a Master\u2019s \ndegree in Information Security. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems \nAdministrator III. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. Applicant began working for his current employer in April 2020. In his \nanswer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under each of the \nthree guidelines set forth below. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nIn February 2020, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. (See Government \nExhibit 2.) The debts listed in the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy were discharged in July 2020. \nA Credit report of the Applicant dated February 1, 2022, confirms this bankruptcy. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant explained that he had a seizure at work in \nSeptember 2019, and lost his job. He could no longer afford to pay the household bills. \n(Tr. p. 68.) He is the sole financial provider of the household, as his wife does not work \noutside of the home. The bills discharged were mainly credit cards that he was able to \npay when he was employed. Some debt that was discharged were his wife\u2019s credit \ncards that he did not know about. He managed to keep the house and his student loan \ndebt. \nApplicant currently has no delinquent debt. He pays his bills on time, and lives \nwithin his means. He now uses a computer program to help him with his budget when \nhe pays his monthly expenses. He now has money in his bank account, and three \n401(k) accounts where he is saving for retirement. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe Government alleges that Applicant engages in excessive alcohol consumption \nthat can lead to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, \nand can raise questions about his reliability and trustworthiness.  \nApplicant has a history of alcohol consumption that began as an adolescent and \nhas continued into adulthood, despite there being legal and occupational \nconsequences. Applicant began consuming alcohol at sixteen years of age. He states \nthat he usually consumes beer. Over the years, he has encountered problems at the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwork place and outside of work from his excessive alcohol consumption. He was \narrested in 1992, 1993, and 1997, for Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants (DUI). \nApplicant does not recall the exact dates or all of the circumstances of the arrests. \n(Government Exhibits 5, 6, and 7.) \nApplicant testified that following his second arrest for DUI, the court ordered him \nto attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for 90 days, at least once a week.  (Tr.\np. 30.)  He remembers that after his first and second DUI, he was able to stop drinking\nfor at least a month.  (Tr. p. 31.)  Regarding his third DUI in 1997, he really has no\nmemory of it.  He does know that the court sentenced him to complete 90 days of AA\nmeetings again, and that he was placed on probation for a period of time.  Following all\nthree arrests for DUI, his driver\u2019s license was also revoked.  After the first DUI, his\nlicense was revoked for 30 days; after the second DUI, his license was revoked for 90\ndays; and following the third DUI, his license was revoked for one year.  (Tr. pp. 32-33.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that while working for a defense contractor from 2007 to 2015, \nhe was reported on two occasions by two different individuals because they could smell \nalcohol on his breath at work.  He was warned that if it kept happening, he would be \nsubject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.  (Tr. p. 36.)  Applicant \nadmits that he had been drinking prior to coming to work on the days that his breath \nsmelled of alcohol.  (Tr. p. 37.)  He was drinking on average about a six-pack to a 12-\npack of beer every other day, but did not feel impaired by his drinking.  (Tr. p. 39.)   \nIn November 2018, Applicant was working for another employer. \nOn this \noccasion, he was sent home from work because alcohol was detected on his breath. \nApplicant believes that he had consumed three beers before going to work that day. \n(Tr. p. 41.) For about a month, from November 2018 to December 2018, he received \ncounseling treatment for his alcohol abuse. \nApplicant stated that he met with a \npsychiatrist for half hour sessions. He did not find their discussions overly helpful, as it \nappeared to him that the psychiatrist seemed more concerned with other things. (Tr. p. \n42.) Applicant was able to abstain from drinking alcohol for about two months following \nthe work incident. (Tr. p. 43.) \nIt was not until March 2019, that Applicant realized that he had a real drinking \nproblem and needed help. He knew that he was drinking heavily, consuming between \n6-10 drinks on a daily basis. Through his Employee Assistance Program, he voluntarily \nsought out help for his alcohol problem. He was concerned that his drinking heavily \nmight be related to his depression.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  \nIn March 2019, Applicant was called into work when he had been drinking earlier \nthat day at home. He believes that he had consumed about five or six beers before \ngoing to work that day. Applicant arrived at work and smelled of alcohol. His employer \nrequired him to take a breathalyzer. Applicant registered a blood alcohol content of \n0.167%. Applicant was terminated from his job. (Tr. pp. 43-44.) \nApplicant entered a 30-day inpatient treatment program for alcohol abuse. From \nMarch 2019 to April 2019, he received intense treatment for alcohol abuse.

(Tr. p. 46, and Government Exhibit 9.) \nApplicant stated that following his in-patient treatment program, he was \nunemployed, depressed and drinking again. From September through October 2019, \nhe was unemployed. He testified that he was not consuming much beer because food \nand bills came first and money was scarce. (Tr. p. 49.)  \nHe last consumed alcohol about a week before the hearing. (Tr. p. 49.) He \nconsumed a couple shots of Jim Beam and two beers. (Tr. p. 55.) In the last three \nmonths, Applicant consumed alcohol about once or twice a week. \nHe usually \nconsumes four or five beers on each occasion. Applicant testified that he was told by \nhis primary physician that he should stop drinking. \nApplicant was referred for evaluation to determine if he may have a condition or \ndiagnosis, which if left untreated may disqualify him from being eligible to access \nclassified information. During the evaluation by the psychologist on December 7, 2021, \nApplicant was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder moderate/severe. This evaluation \nwas obtained through an interview with the Applicant, a comprehensive review of all \nmedical records and supporting records provided by the DODCAF or his security \nmanager. (Government Exhibit 8.) \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has an emotional, mental, and \npersonality condition that can impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. Applicant \nadmits the allegation set forth under this allegation. \nApplicant\u2019s evaluation discussed above also determined that Applicant was \ndiagnosed with an unspecified depressive disorder. \nResults of the personality \nassessment indicated that he may be vulnerable to self-criticism, uncertainty and \nindecisiveness during periods of stress. The evaluator also stated that Applicant\u2019s long \nhistory of alcohol abuse with a lack of sustained abstinence inherently brings risk to his \njudgment and reliability.  (Government Exhibit 8.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant lost his job and was unable to pay his bills. He filed Bankruptcy in \n2020 to discharge his delinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant suffered a seizure at work and was ultimately let go from his \nemployment. As a result, he was unable to pay the household bills, as he was the sole \nfinancial provider in the family. He was forced to file bankruptcy to discharge the debt. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn this case circumstances beyond his control, namely his seizure and loss of \nemployment, warranted his Bankruptcy filing. Accordingly, this allegation is found for \nthe Applicant. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;   \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual was diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol consumption has resulted in three arrests \nfor DUI\u2019s and various other problems at work. These incidents raise serious security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(e). \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant is an alcoholic with a long pattern of abusive drinking. Applicant has \nbeen arrested three times for DUI and has been warned and terminated by employers \nfor having alcohol on his breath at work. Applicant has undergone a 30-day inpatient \ntreatment program for his alcohol addiction, but has not been able to maintain sustained \nsobriety. \nEach time, he abstains from alcohol for a period before relapsing and \nreturning to his regular drinking pattern of drinking. Applicant states that his goal is to \nquit drinking, but he is not there yet. Under the circumstances, Applicant has not \ndemonstrated sufficient good judgment and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. \u00b6 23 does not provide mitigation. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are strongly established in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness;  \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has been diagnosed with an \nunspecified depressive disorder. This condition coupled with his excessive drinking can \naffected his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. There is no indication that his \nconditions are under control or in remission. Applicant\u2019s recent evaluation and diagnosis \nfrom a Government-approved evaluator indicates that his continued drinking brings a \nrisk to his judgment and reliability. Accordingly, the Psychological Conditions guideline \nis found against Appellant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, G, and I in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and analysis \nset forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that \nhe meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol Consumption and Psychological \nConditions security concerns.

He explained that where he lived, most \npeople owned trucks. He kept M1 for his sister to use to go to work and school. In about \nDecember 2019, he traded in the truck for the purchase of another luxury vehicle (M2) \nthat was two years old. He owed about $21,000 on the loan for the truck, but the dealer \ngave him $28,000 for the truck. The remainder of the purchase price of M2 was \nfinanced with a loan of about $32,700.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted auto loans, \nrepossessed vehicles, and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant admitted owing all of the debts alleged in the SOR. He stated that he \n\u201cmade very poor financial and budgeting errors when [he] was younger.\u201d His finances \nwere at least partially responsible for his discharge from the military. Some of \nApplicant\u2019s questionable decisions were made recently. Having already had a vehicle \nrepossessed, and while having multiple delinquent debts, Applicant took out loans for a \nluxury vehicle and a truck at the same time, and then had loans for two luxury vehicles \nat the same time. He allowed one of the luxury vehicles to be voluntarily repossessed in \nOctober 2020. \nApplicant is credited with paying several debts that were not alleged in the SOR, \nincluding debts of $877, $1,375, $169, and $1,409. However, he only started paying the \nSOR debts in March 2022, documenting eight $40 payments, or $320. I would like to \nthink that he will continue paying his debts, but his history of questionable financial \ndecisions causes me to have doubts that he will do so. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 29, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

He served in the \nmilitary from 1985 to 1996 and received an honorable discharge. He attended community \ncollege in 2005, but did not earn a degree. He has been employed by a federal contractor \nsince June 2020. He had a three-month period of unemployment before then due to the \npandemic. He was employed from May 2019 to March 2020. He was unemployed due to \na medical issue from September 2017 to May 2019. Before then he was employed from \n2009 to September 2017 by different civilian employers. He worked for federal contractors \nfrom 1997 to 2007. In his security clearance application, he left a gap in his employment \nhistory from 2007 to 2009. (Item 3) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his \nanswer to the SOR, government interrogatories, statements to a government investigator, \nother official documents, and credit reports from August 2020 and August 2021. (Items 2, \n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for a tax lien \nentered in 2019, in the approximate amount of $55,308. Applicant denied the debt in his \nSOR answer. He said he hired a lawyer and his tax debt was entered into the \u201cFresh \nStart\u201d program with the IRS. He stated: \u201cIf that program has been rescinded, I am unaware \nas I have not received any further correspondence from the Internal Revenue Service \nabout his matter.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s February 2022 response to Government Interrogatories \nhe stated that he had applied for the IRS \u201cFresh Start\u201d program and was accepted. He \ncould not recall the name of the tax firm that assisted him and said he did not have a \ncurrent federal tax liability since he started the program. He also stated he did not \ncurrently have an installment agreement or other payment plan with the IRS. (Items 2, 3, \n5) \nThe IRS website states the Fresh Start program is a program that helps taxpayers \nby adopting flexibility in Offers-In-Compromise (OIC) terms, which allows a taxpayer to \nsettle an amount owed for less.

(Item 5) \n1  \nApplicant admitted he owed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($43,573) and 1.g \n(past-due mortgage payment of $8,753 on a balance of $153,931). In his SOR answer \nregarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he said he was currently \u201cworking with a debt specialist \nto work on the remainder of my outstanding debt in anticipation of applying for a mortgage \nloan.\u201d This debt was for a swimming pool loan he obtained in 2016, which he stopped \npaying in 2019. (Item 3) Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, he stated his property had \ngone into foreclosure and \u201csold by the bank for less than what they would have received \nat a \u2018short sale.\u2019 After the foreclosure sale, I did not receive any correspondence regarding \nany balance owed. This is also being addressed by my debt specialist.\u201d Applicant did not \nprovide any evidence to support his claims or any actions he has taken to resolve these \ndebts. He did not provide evidence as to actions his debt specialist has taken. These \ndebts are unresolved. (Items 2, 7, 8, 9, 10) \nApplicant denied the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($3,923). In his SOR answer \nhe said he had no recollection of the creditor, and when he reviewed his credit report with \na mortgage broker it did not appear. He did not provide any evidence to show he is not \nresponsible for this debt. (Items 2, 9, 10) \nApplicant denied the medical collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($280) 1.e ($252), \nand 1.f ($252). During his September 2020 interview with a government investigator, he \nwas confronted with these debts. He acknowledged the medical debts were likely from \nmedical services he received in 2017. He believed the services were covered by his \nmedical insurance at the time, but because he was laid off they likely were not covered. \nHe believed they should have been. He told the investigator he would rectify the debts. \nHe stated in his SOR answer that he contacted the creditors and requested they provide \nhim the dates of service and billing information. He stated he had not received any \ncorrespondence from the creditors. He said his debt specialist had also been in contact \nwith the creditors requesting information about the accounts. Applicant did not provide \nany documentary evidence about his efforts to dispute or resolve the debts or anything \nfrom his debt specialists. These debts are unresolved. (Items 2, 8, 9, 10) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2020. In \nresponse to section 26, which asked if in the past seven years he had failed to file or pay \nFederal, state, or other taxes, he answered \u201cno.\u201d It also asked if in the past seven years \nhe had property foreclosed, defaulted on any type of loan, had bills turned over to a \ncollection agency or had any account suspended, charged off, or canceled for failure to \npay, or if he was over 120 days delinquent on any debt not previously mentioned.

He \ndid not disclose his Federal tax lien. In his June 2021 answer to government \ninterrogatories which asked if he had any additional adverse or delinquent accounts, \nincluding taxes, that he owed, he answered \u201cno.\u201d The SOR alleges his failure to disclose \nthis derogatory information was deliberate. (Items 3, 7, 8) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he explained that he did not disclose his tax debt \nbecause the SCA asked if he failed to file his tax returns. He stated he had filed them, so \nhis answer of \u201cno\u201d was correct. He further stated: \u201cI did not intend to mislead on my answer \nas my tax liability was removed by the [above] mentioned program.\u201d (Item 2) Applicant \nwas referring to the Fresh Start program. (Item 2 \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview with the government investigator he did \nnot disclose the swimming pool collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.b). When confronted with the \ndebt he acknowledged it and explained that when he was laid off in 2019 he could not \nafford the monthly payments of $500. After not paying for about two months the creditor \ncontacted him and Applicant requested the loan be extended so he could make up for \nmissed payments and make a future payment agreement. The creditor declined \nApplicant\u2019s proposal. Applicant said he never heard from the company again and \nassumed the debt was charged off. He did not attempt to contact the creditor again. He \nsaid he was unaware the debt went to collection. He claimed he forgot about the debt so \nhe did not disclose it. (Items 2, 7, 8) \nRegarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant said in his SOR answer he had no \nrecollection of it and denied deliberately failing to disclose it. There is no evidence in his \nbackground interview that Applicant was confronted with this debt by the investigator. \n(Item 2, 7, 8) \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement as part of his answer to \ngovernment interrogatories. Under the section \u201cDebts-list all financial obligations by name \nof person/company/firm.\u201d He did not list any payments being made to the IRS. (Item 9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nA Federal tax lien in the amount of $55,308 was filed against Applicant in 2019. \nApplicant has numerous other delinquent debts that are also unresolved. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has not provided any substantive evidence to corroborate his \nparticipation in an IRS program to resolve his Federal tax lien or that he no longer has a \nFederal tax liability. The program he says he is participating in is not a forgiveness \nprogram, but one that assists taxpayers in settling their tax debts. He said he had a tax \nlawyer assist him, but failed to provide any evidence to show his actions. AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant was unemployed for a significant period and had medical issues. These \nwere conditions beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must \nshow he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He provided no explanation for why \nhe has a $55,308 Federal tax lien. He mentions he has a debt specialist, but provided no \ncorroborating evidence of any actions either he or the debt specialist may have taken to \nresolve his outstanding debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nApplicant failed to provide documentary or other corroborating evidence that he is \nresolving any of his other delinquent debts. He merely states that a debt specialist is \nhandling the matters. He disputes some of his debts, but failed to provide documented \nproof to substantiate his dispute or other evidence of action to resolve the debts. I am \nunable to determine if he has participated in financial counseling and there is minimal \nevidence that he is resolving any of his delinquent debts. The evidence is insufficient to \nconclude future issues are unlikely to recur. I find his behavior cast doubts on his good \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not \napply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant failed to disclose his Federal tax lien in his SCA, during his personal \nsubject interview with a government investigator and on government interrogatories. His \nexplanation was he did not believe he had to disclose the information because he believed \nhis tax liability was removed because he was participating in the IRS Fresh Start program. \nHe stated he did not intentionally mean to mislead the government. However, misguided \nApplicant\u2019s interpretation of the program he says he is participating in with the IRS, I find \nthat he believes he no longer has a tax liability and therefore did not have to report it. \nRegarding the other delinquent debts he failed to disclose, Applicant claimed he was \nunaware of them or did not remember them and his actions were unintentional. There is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude Applicant intentionally failed to disclose or deliberately \nfalsified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not established a reliable financial track record and has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The evidence supports that Applicant is unfamiliar with his financial \nobligations and has taken minimal action to resolve them. His large Federal tax lien raises \nsignificant concerns about his ability to comply with rules and regulations. The record \nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nApplicant refuted the personal conduct security concerns raised under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(Item 4) \nThe SOR alleged only that Applicant had failed to timely file, as required, federal \nincome tax returns \u201cfor at least tax year 2019.\u201d Since Applicant\u2019s sole failure to timely file \na federal income tax return was related to the tax year 2019, and the OPM investigator \ncleared up the erroneous 2020 issue, there is no evidence that there were any other tax \nyears in which Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns. Accordingly, \nthe allegation, as it refers to \u201cat least,\u201d is without any evidence to support it. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant admittedly failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax \nyear 2019. AG \u00b6 19(f) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply. Applicant attributed his financial issue to a \nmiscommunication between his parents and himself, and he repeatedly accepted full \nresponsibility for the issue. Because his parents had always handled his income tax filings \nin the past, he thought they would do so again, but they didn\u2019t, and they never explained \nwhy they thought this time it would be different. He also repeated that he has personally \ndone his taxes in recent years and will continue to do so in the future. He added that he \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis great with his finances; has great credit for an individual his age; and he has always \npaid his bills on time. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n. \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nIf this is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability \u2013 \nas declared by the Appeal Board \u2013 Applicant\u2019s age and the isolated instance, under the \ncircumstances described by him, are significant. In this instance, the Appeal Board\u2019s \ncommentaries are instructive. The facts are that at the time of Applicant\u2019s isolated \u2013 not \nrepeated \u2013 failure to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2019, he was \n19 years old and still residing with his parents. He had been working since he was 16 \nyears old, and his parents had previously filed his federal income tax returns, and he \nmistakenly thought they would do so again, but they didn\u2019t, and they never explained why \nthey thought this time it would be different. The failure to timely file was due to a \ncircumstance \u2013 an apparent miscommunication between his parents and himself \u2013 that \nwas without his knowledge, and as such, was beyond his control. When he found out \nabout the issue, he was honest and candid in reporting the issue in his SF 86, to the OPM \ninvestigator, in his answer to the interrogatories, and in his Answer to the SOR. Despite \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nthe allegation, and his admission to it, there is zero evidence that Applicant has a problem \nwith complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Under the \ncircumstances, while his failure to timely file a federal income tax return is definitely a \nsecurity concern, in this instance the concern has been substantially minimized. \nApplicant\u2019s honesty, candor, maturity, and the explanation and efforts to resolve the tax \nissue, as well as the fact that he has taken full responsibility for the failure to file, under \nthe circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n. \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept. Applicant \nfailed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2019. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 21-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a tank tester with his current employer since November 2020. He previously \nworked for fast-food restaurant as a kitchen lead trainer (June 2017 \u2013 October 2020). He \nis a 2019 high school graduate, having been home-schooled. At the time of his isolated \n\u2013 not repeated \u2013 failure to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2019, \nhe was 19 years old and still residing with his parents. He had been working since he was \n16 years old, and his parents had previously filed his federal income tax returns, and he \nmistakenly thought they would do so again, but they didn\u2019t, and they never explained why \nthey thought this time it would be different. The failure to timely file was due to an apparent \nmiscommunication between his parents and himself, that was without his knowledge, and \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nas such, was beyond his control. When he found out about the issue, he was honest and \ncandid in reporting the issue. While his failure to timely file a federal income tax return is \ndefinitely a security concern, in this instance the concern has been substantially \nminimized. Applicant\u2019s honesty, candor, maturity, and the explanation and efforts to \nresolve the tax issue, under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 51 years old. He earned a General Education Diploma in 1989. He is not married, but cohabitated with the same partner from 1994 until at least 2021. He has two children (ages 18 and 27). He has been employed as a maintenance worker since July 2021, and has held various positions including laborer and truck driver. He was unemployed for approximately three months in 2017. (Items 1, 2) The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, totaling approximately $22,318. Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, and 1.h with explanations. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g, claiming that he had resolved that debt. (Item 1) The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. SOR \u00b6 1.a: credit account charged off for $9,278. Applicant admitted the allegation. He reported opening the account in November 2019 to finance a $7,200 motorcycle/gear purchase. He voluntarily surrendered the motorcycle in March 2021, and understood he was responsible for any deficiency balance following sale of the motorcycle at auction. He also reported that there had been no communications from the creditor since he returned the motorcycle and that there had been no settlement negotiations. The September 2021 credit report reflects the account as charged off with a $9,278 balance. The May 2022 credit report reflects the debt as charged off with a $9,278 balance and $7,650 past due. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7-8, Item 4 at 2, Ite",

Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the FORM on May 10, 2022, but submitted no response. There \nwere no objections by Applicant, and Items 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence. The \ncase was assigned to me on August 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 51 years old. He earned a General Education Diploma in 1989. He is \nnot married, but cohabitated with the same partner from 1994 until at least 2021. He has \ntwo children (ages 18 and 27). He has been employed as a maintenance worker since \nJuly 2021, and has held various positions including laborer and truck driver. He was \nunemployed for approximately three months in 2017. (Items 1, 2) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, totaling approximately $22,318. Applicant \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, and 1.h with explanations. He denied \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g, claiming that he had resolved that debt. (Item 1) \nThe evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit account charged off for $9,278. Applicant admitted the \nallegation. He reported opening the account in November 2019 to finance a $7,200 \nmotorcycle/gear purchase. He voluntarily surrendered the motorcycle in March 2021, and \nunderstood he was responsible for any deficiency balance following sale of the \nmotorcycle at auction. He also reported that there had been no communications from the \ncreditor since he returned the motorcycle and that there had been no settlement \nnegotiations. The September 2021 credit report reflects the account as charged off with \na $9,278 balance. The May 2022 credit report reflects the debt as charged off with a \n$9,278 balance and $7,650 past due. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7-8, \nItem 4 at 2, Item 5 at 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit card account charged off for $4,634. Applicant admitted the \nallegation. He reported the account became delinquent in early 2019 and did not recall \nother account details. September 2021 and May 2022 credit reports reflect the account \nas charged off with a $4,634 balance. In October 2019, a $4,634 \u201cCivil Judgment\u201d was \nentered against Applicant. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 4, 5, 7, Item 4 at \n3, Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 2) \nSOR \u00b61.c: credit card account charged off for $3,075. Applicant admitted the \nallegation. He reported the account became delinquent in approximately April 2017, and \nthat there had been no settlement negotiations. The September 2021 and May 2022 \ncredit reports reflect the account as charged off with a $3,075 balance. This debt is not \nresolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 4, 7, Item 4 at 3, Item 5 at 5) \nSOR \u00b61.d: credit card account charged off for $2,212. Applicant admitted the \nallegation.

This debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 5, 7, Item 4 at 3, \nItem 5 at 4) \nSOR \u00b61.e: collection account for $1,362. Applicant admitted the allegation, but \nprovided no additional details. The September 2021 credit report reflects the account as \nplaced for collection with a $1,362 balance. The May 2022 credit report does not reflect \nthe account. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7, Item 4 at 4) \nSOR \u00b61.f: collection account for $663. Applicant admitted the allegation and \nreported the debt is for a retail credit account, but could provide no further details. The \nSeptember 2021 and May 2022 credit reports reflect the account as placed for collection \nwith a balance of $663. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7, Item 4 at 4, Item 5 \nat 4) \nSOR \u00b61.g: collection account for $636. Applicant denied the allegation and \nclaimed that he had paid this account. He submitted evidence that the account payoff \namount was $636.78 until March 15, 2022, but did not submit evidence that he had paid \nor otherwise resolved the debt. He told the background investigator that he believed this \nwas a high interest rate credit card account, and that he had decided not to pay the \nexorbitant late fees assessed after he missed a payment. He has not engaged in \nsettlement negotiations. The September 2021 and May 2022 credit reports reflect the \naccount as placed for collection with a $636 balance, and that the consumer disputes the \naccount information. In May 2021, a \u201cSmall Claims Judgment\u201d was entered against \nApplicant for $636, and listed the same creditor as alleged in the SOR. This debt is not \nresolved. (Item 1 at 4-5, Item 3 at 6-7, Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 1) \nSOR \u00b61.h: collection account for $458. Applicant admitted the allegation, could \nnot recall the account details, and has not engaged in settlement negotiations. September \n2021 and May 2022 credit reports reflect the account as placed for collection with a $458 \nbalance. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7, Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 5) \nIn a September 2021 background interview, Applicant attributed his financial \nissues to unemployment, underemployment, being the sole wage earner in his home, \nfamily expenses, and a truck payment that he could not afford. He explained that he \npurchased a truck in July 2017 for $27,000 and made required loan payments until early \n2019. When he voluntarily returned the truck to the dealer the outstanding loan balance \nexceeded the vehicle\u2019s value by $5,000, and he depleted his savings by paying the \ndeficiency balance and purchasing another vehicle. He said that his fianc\u00e9 was disabled, \nunable to work and received approximately $600 monthly compensation for her disability. \n(Item 3 at 4-8) \nApplicant reported retaining a law firm in 2019 to assist in consolidating credit card \ndebt, making three of the required $350 monthly payments, and then terminating those \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \npayments because he could not afford them.

He said that he was timely paying his \ncurrent debts, and indicated his willingness to pay delinquent debts, but said that he could \nnot afford to do so. Applicant\u2019s recent credit records reflect no accounts in collection or \ncharged off, except those alleged in the SOR. (Item 3 at 4-8, Item 4, Item 5) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had been solely responsible for \nsupporting his family of four over the past 28 years, that his long-term relationship with \nhis cohabitant had recently ended, and that he had sold his house. He noted his intent to \napply proceeds from the sale of his home to his debts and provided documentary \nevidence of a pending sale, but provided no documentary evidence the sale occurred. He \nwrote that he was working on contacting his creditors and resolving his debts, \ncommunicating with lawyers in an effort to resolve his debts, and hoped to declare \nbankruptcy soon. He stated that his employer recently increased his pay in recognition of \nhis hard work and loyalty, and provided documentary evidence of his excellent job \nperformance. He said that he would never jeopardize his family or job because of financial \ndifficulties. (Item 1 at 3-11) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish a history of \nfinancial problems dating back to at least 2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

While the evidence reflects that Applicant is \nresolving one of the debts alleged in the SOR, seven debts alleged in the SOR, totaling \napproximately $20,106, remain unresolved. His financial issues are ongoing, and based \nupon the record evidence I cannot conclude them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of underemployment, \nunemployment, and his cohabitant\u2019s inability to obtain gainful unemployment because of \na disability were largely beyond his control. However, he did not provide sufficient \nevidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant reported working with a law firm in\n2017 in an effort to consolidate delinquent debts, but failed to provide sufficient evidence\nthat he received financial counseling and that the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through\n1.c and 1.e through 1.h are being resolved or that his finances are otherwise under\ncontrol.\n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established.

However, he provided insufficient evidence to support a \nconclusion that he has initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay the creditors, \nor otherwise resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and 1.e through 1.h. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is concluded for Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although there is some evidence Applicant disputed \ndebts alleged in the SOR, he has provided insufficient evidence to establish a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of any debt, or to substantiate the basis of any dispute, or \nof actions taken to resolve any issue. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education and \nemployment history; that his financial problems were caused, in part, by circumstances \nbeyond his control, and that he has acted responsibly regarding one of his delinquent \naccounts. \nHowever, he has not established a \u201cmeaningful track record of debt reduction.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \npay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the \nSOR.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are applicable in this case: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6 19(a) applies.  \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. At the outset, the \nAppeal Board has consistently held that an applicant is not required to resolve every debt \nalleged in the SOR. Nor is there a requirement that SOR debts be resolved first. An \napplicant need only show by his actions his effort to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts occurred in April and May 2020. That is not very long ago. \nNor were those SOR debts infrequent. Because of the frequency and recency of debts, \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate his debts. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s financial problems began between 2016 and 2018, which \ncoincided with two unfortunate developments in his personal and professional life. In \n2016, his spouse lost her job. In 2018, he became unemployed for six months, until \nFebruary 2019. Those are conditions \u201clargely beyond [his] control,\u201d within the \ncontemplation of AG \u00b6 20(b). That does not, however, end the inquiry. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) requires that Applicant act \u201cresponsibly\u201d under the adverse \ncircumstances he confronted. In this case, he addressed his major creditor first, SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. ($12,767).  He succeeded in having that creditor issue a debt cancellation, which \nApplicant reported as income in his 2020 federal tax return. That is responsible conduct. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies and mitigates this SOR debt.   \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

In my analysis, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 54 years old. She has worked for her current employer, a defense contractor, since May 2018, as a program and quality manager. She is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. She married in 2016, but has been in a common-law marriage since 2000. She has one adult child and two adult stepchildren. She is unsure if she previously held a security clearance. (Item 3). The SOR alleged Applicant owed delinquent federal taxes for the following tax years and in the following amounts: 2019-$3,326; 2018-$5,626; 2017-$13,392; 2016- $13,326; and 2015-$6,929.

In her answer to the SOR, she admitted owing delinquent taxes for tax years 2015-2018. She made the same admissions in her response to the FORM. She explained the reason for her tax liability was because she failed to have enough money withheld every pay period from her paycheck.

On August 13, 2022, she submitted a two-page response to the FORM, \nwhich I have marked as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. Items 3-10 are admitted into evidence, \nas is AE A. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted some of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e) and denied others \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f-1.m). Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. She has worked for her current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since May 2018, as a program and quality manager. She is a high school \ngraduate and has taken some college courses. She married in 2016, but has been in a \ncommon-law marriage since 2000. She has one adult child and two adult stepchildren. \nShe is unsure if she previously held a security clearance. (Item 3). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed delinquent federal taxes for the following tax \nyears and in the following amounts: 2019-$3,326; 2018-$5,626; 2017-$13,392; 2016-\n$13,326; and 2015-$6,929. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). Applicant\u2019s submission of IRS tax transcripts as \npart of her October 2020 and April 2022 responses to interrogatories established her \nfederal income tax delinquencies for tax years 2015-2019. In her answer to the SOR, \nshe admitted owing delinquent taxes for tax years 2015-2018. She made the same \nadmissions in her response to the FORM. She explained the reason for her tax liability \nwas because she failed to have enough money withheld every pay period from her \npaycheck. She claimed in her SOR answer that she paid the federal tax debt for 2019 \nand that she had set up a payment plan, or was working with a tax service to pay the \nfederal taxes owed for 2015-2018. In her FORM response, she also claimed her 2019 \nfederal tax was paid and that she was now working directly with the IRS on a payment \nplan to pay her remaing tax debts for 2015-2018. She failed to produce any \ndocumentation corroborating payment for her 2019 federal tax debt or her payment \nplans for her 2015-2018 federal tax debts. Her federal tax debts have not been \nresolved. (Items 2, 4 (pp. 12-18), 6 (pp. 8-15); AE A) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed eight delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $5,548. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.m) Applicant denied owing these debts in her SOR \nanswer. She renewed her denials in her FORM response. She avers that she had no \nknowledge of the debts, that the debt was paid, or that she has disputed the debt. When \nshe provided additional information to her background investigator in a letter dated \nFebruary 4, 2020, she admitted many of the debts that she has recently denied. She \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.m. All the debts are listed in Applicant\u2019s most recent \ncredit report from December 2021. She presented no documentary evidence showing \npayment of any of these debts or of her successfully disputing any debts. These debts \nare unresolved.

The bankruptcy was not alleged in the \nSOR so I will not use that evidence for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it \nas it relates to the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and in my assessment of the \nwhole-person factors. (Item 10) \nApplicant completed an income and expense worksheet in October 2020. It \nshowed her net monthly income of $4,300\u2014her total monthly expenses of $2,200\u2014and \nmonthly debts payments of $1,821, resulting in her disposable monthly income of $279. \nNo federal tax payments were included in this budget. She stated in her SOR answer \nthat she had received financial counseling through her bank and a credit relief company. \n(Items 2, 4 (p. 11) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant owes delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2015-2019. She also has \ndelinquent consumer debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. All the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. She did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. Her decision not to have enough money withheld from her monthly \npaychecks, which caused a shortfall for her federal income tax obligation, was not a \ncondition beyond her control. Additionally, the evidence does not support that she has \ntaken responsible actions to address her debts or pay the delinquent taxes she owes. \nShe failed to document any efforts she made to pay her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes apply. While Applicant stated she received some financial counseling, the \nevidence is insufficient to establish that her financial matters are under control. She has \nnot shown a good-faith effort to address her debts or pay her past-due federal taxes. \nShe failed to document any legitimate dispute of the listed debts. AG \u00b6 20(c) partially \napplies, but AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) do not apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I also considered her lack of \nprogress in resolving her debts, and her failure to document any payments towards her \ndelinquent federal tax debt from 2015-2019. Applicant has not established a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

As of the date of the SOR, the bench warrant remained \nactive. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the facts, stated he had a lawyer \nand offered no other information. In his response to the FORM, he provided a receipt to \nshow he paid a fine associated with a sentence for the offense of DUI 2nd  offense on the \nalleged dated, and he was participating in an alcohol substance course for the next four \nweeks. (Item 1) \nIn November 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). \nSection 22-Police Record of the SCA, asked Applicant if in the past seven years he had \nbeen issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding \nagainst him; if in the last seven years if he had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarshal or any other type of law enforcement official; in the last seven years if he had \nbeen charged, convicted, or sentenced to a crime in any court; and in the last seven years \nif he had been or was currently on probation or parole.

(SOR \n\u00b6 1.c) \nApplicant\u2019s SCA also asked under Section 22-Police Record, if other than offenses \nalready listed, if he EVER had been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. \nHe answered no and failed to disclose those offenses listed above and his April 2009 \nDWI conviction. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nIn December 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \nwas asked if he had ever been arrested, charged, or convicted of any alcohol-related \noffenses. He disclosed to the investigator that he had been arrested twice for DWI: 2009 \nand 2015. He disclosed to the investigator that he was arrested in April 2009 after drinking \nat a pool hall. He was stopped by the police, failed a field sobriety test, and placed under \narrest for DWI. He was given a breathalyzer test and was over the legal limit. He plead \nguilty to DWI in court and was ordered to pay a fine. (Item 3) \nApplicant also disclosed to the investigator during his December 2020 interview \nthat in April 2015 he was driving and came upon a DUI checkpoint. He had an open \ncontainer of alcohol in his vehicle. Applicant said he passed both the field sobriety and \nbreathalyzer tests. He could not recall what he was initially charged with. He could not \nrecall going to court. He possibly recalled receiving a letter from the court ordering him to \npay a fine and attend an alcohol education class. Documents from the FBI database and \nstate court records reflect Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI in April 2015 and \nwas found guilty of DUI and fined. (Items 4-5) \nApplicant\u2019s explanation to the investigator for failing to disclose the required \ninformation on his SCA that specifically asked about his past arrests and those for alcohol-\nrelated incidents was that he misread the question regarding alcohol-related arrests and \nthought the question was referring to felony offenses only. Applicant did not disclose to \nthe investigator during this interview that he had been arrested in April 2014 and charged \nwith possession of alcohol and careless driving, and his most recent September 2019 \narrest and charge for DUI. (Item 3) \nIn February 2021, Applicant was interviewed a second time by a government \ninvestigator. He told the investigator that he failed to disclose his alcohol-related arrests \ndue to overlooking the alcohol-related questions on his SCA. He said he was not \nintentionally trying to conceal his alcohol-related arrests. No explanation was provided as \nto why he did not disclose his April 2014 and September 2019 arrests during his first \ninterview. He disclosed that he had obtained an attorney and pleaded not guilty to the \nSeptember 2019 charge and the case was pending.

After paying for the groceries, he was stopped by the loss prevention employee \nand asked to come to the office. Applicant said he was informed by the employee that he \nhad two steaks and a bag of shrimp that he did not register at the checkout. He questioned \nthe employee about why he would purchase $200 worth of groceries and not pay for the \nsteak and shrimp that cost about $20. He was released and informed his name would be \nentered into the store\u2019s database and if a similar incident occurred again, he would be \narrested. (Item 3) \nThe SOR (\u00b6 2.c) alleged Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on his SCA his \nApril 2014, April 2015 and September 2019 arrests. In his answer to the SOR, he stated, \n\u201cI deny. I did not fully read the question, upon being asked I answered honestly and \ntruthfully.\u201d (Item 1) The SOR also alleged (\u00b6 2.d) that in his SCA, Applicant was \nspecifically asked about alcohol-related offenses and he denied ever having been \narrested or charged with any. Applicant denied this allegation. The SOR alleged he \nfalsified material facts when he was questioned by the government investigator in \nDecember 2020 about alcohol-related offenses and failed to disclose his April 2014 and \nSeptember 2019 offenses (SOR \u00b6 2.e). Applicant\u2019s SOR answer stated: \u201cI misunderstood \nthe question but when asked an answer was given.\u201d (Item 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided a receipt from July 2022 to show \nhe completed a payment towards a fine associated with his September 2019 DUI offense. \nThe receipt reflects that the DUI is a second offense. No other information was provided \nregarding this charge, the sentence, and whether he is on probation. He stated that he \nwas \u201cdoing an alcohol substance\u201d that required him to attend weekly for four weeks. He \nalso stated, \u201cI admitted to what I have done but I did misread the questions.\u201d (AE A) \nI find Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his SCA when he failed to \ndisclose any of his arrests. The SCA asked if he had any arrests in the past seven years. \nHe answered no. It asked if he had EVER had any alcohol-related arrests, charges, or \nconvictions. He answered no. In December 2020, he was questioned by a government \ninvestigator, and when asked if he had any alcohol-related arrests, he disclosed two and \ndid not disclose his most recent DUI arrest of September 2019, which was pending, and \nhis 2014 arrest. He did not disclose these previously because he thought he only had to \ndisclose felonies. I do not believe he misread the SCA or overlooked the questions \nbecause when he had an opportunity to disclose all of his past alcohol-related arrests \nduring his first interview, he failed to do so. At that point, he was on notice to report all \ncriminal and alcohol-related offenses and he did not. It was only after the investigator did \na second interview that he disclosed his 2014 and 2019 arrests. His explanations are not \nbelievable.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has been convicted three times for DWI or DUI from 2009 to 2019. He \nalso was charged with possession of alcohol in 2014. The above disqualifying condition \napplies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating condition under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents beginning in 2009. He was \nrequired to take an alcohol education class after his 2009 DWI conviction. In his response \nto the FORM, he stated he was participating in a four-week alcohol substance course, \npresumably court-ordered after his 2019 conviction. Without additional evidence, I cannot \nfind that he is participating in a counseling or a treatment program and is making \nsatisfactory progress. AG \u00b6 23(c) and 23(d) do not apply. He provided no other evidence \nwhich would indicate that future alcohol-related issues are unlikely to recur. He has not \nacknowledged his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use or evidence to overcome it. None \nof the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16, and following that may be \npotentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which , when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n(e) personal conduct , or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant completed a SCA in November 2020 and did not disclose any of his past \ncriminal arrests, charges, or convictions, which included three charges for DWI and DUI, \nthe most recent in September 2019, and his arrest in 2014 for careless driving and \npossession of alcohol. When questioned by a government investigator in December 2020, \nhe said the reason he failed to disclose his arrests was that he thought he only had to \ndisclose felony arrests. During the interview, he only disclosed his 2009 DUI conviction \nand the April 2014 arrest for possession of alcohol and careless driving. He did not \ndisclose his April 2015 DUI conviction or his most recent September 2019 arrest for DUI \nthat was still pending. In his SOR answer, he said he misread the question, but when \nasked, he gave an answer. However, when he was initially asked by the investigator in \nDecember 2020, he did not give a complete answer and intentionally failed to disclose \nhis most recent DUI arrest from a year earlier, which he was pending trial, and his 2015 \nDUI conviction. Based on the totality of the evidence, I did not find Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations credible. The evidence supports finding that he deliberately attempted to \nconceal his past alcohol-related criminal conduct. I find Applicant deliberately falsified his \nSCA and provided false information during his December 2020 background investigation. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply to these facts. \nApplicant\u2019s four alcohol-related offenses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d) alleged under \nthe alcohol consumption guideline, were cross-alleged under the personal conduct and \ncriminal conduct guidelines. There is sufficient evidence for an adverse determination \nunder both of those guidelines and will not be addressed under the personal conduct \nguideline. \nApplicant admitted he was accused of shoplifting in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He was not \ncharged. This allegation was cross-alleged under the criminal conduct guideline. I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) apply because there may not be sufficient evidence to make an \nadverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline, but which, when combined \nwith all available information, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgement, untrustworthiness, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It is \nalso the type of conduct that, if known, could affect a personal or professional, or \ncommunity standing and subject to exploitation or manipulation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant did not make prompt good-faith efforts to correct his falsifications. His \nactions were not minor. His failure to provide a complete and accurate account of his past \ncriminal and alcohol-related conduct is a serious security concern. The shoplifting \nallegation is minor, but combined with Applicant\u2019s other conduct, I am unable to conclude \nthat future inappropriate conduct is unlikely. His repeated and deliberate falsifications are \nserious and cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. The above \nmitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following three are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.  \nApplicant was convicted of DWI or DUI for offenses that occurred in 2009, 2015, \nand 2019. He was convicted of careless driving and possession of alcohol in 2014. He \ndid not provide information regarding his 2019 DUI conviction as to whether he is on \nprobation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. AG \u00b6 31(c) does not apply. \nApplicant admitted that he was accused of shoplifting in 2019. He denied he \ncommitted the offense, and there is no other evidence regarding this allegation. I find this \nallegation was adequately addressed under the personal conduct guideline. None of the \ncriminal conduct disqualifying conditions apply to this allegation. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has three DUI convictions from 2009 to 2019 and a careless driving and \npossession of alcohol conviction. The current status of his most recent DUI conviction is \nnot contained in this record. At the time he provided a response to the FORM, he was \nparticipating in an alcohol-related course, but did not provide any other information. Based \non his past history and pattern of criminal conduct, I cannot find that future criminal \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant has not provided evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. His past behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption, Guideline E, personal conduct and Guideline J, criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel presented Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which I admitted without objection.

Applicant is now the co-owner \nand a senior management officer of a technology company (the Company), which he co-\nfounded in 2011. He is also the Facility Security Officer (FSO) of the Company. The \nCompany has about 12 employees. Applicant was granted eligibility for a Secret \nclearance in November 2018. The Company is now seeking facility clearance eligibility to \nwork on Top Secret DoD contracts. As one of the Company\u2019s Key Management \nPersonnel, Applicant is also seeking eligibility at the Top Secret level as a requirement \nfor the upgrade of the Company\u2019s facility clearance. (Answer at 1-2; Tr. at 28, 43-51; GE \n4 at 1; AE B at 1, 3, 4.) \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause of his recent drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about August 2019 through March 2021 (SOR \n1.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana after he had been granted a \nsecurity clearance in November 2018 (SOR 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant admitted both \nallegations under this guideline. (Answer at 1.) \nIn 2019 Applicant started smoking marijuana at the request of his wife. They lived \nin State A where it was legal to purchase and possess marijuana. His wife was \nexperiencing anxiety, and she wanted to use marijuana to ease her discomfort and help \nher sleep at night. When the Company was given the opportunity in 2021 to work on a \nDoD contract that required the Company to have a Top Secret facility clearance, Applicant \nknew that he would need to upgrade his clearance, and he stopped smoking marijuana. \nHis wife continued to occasionally smoke marijuana alone in the family\u2019s garage before \nretiring to sleep. Applicant submitted his e-QIP for his upgraded clearance a couple of \nmonths later. He disclosed his marijuana use in his e-QIP and wrote that he used it about \n40-50 times during the period August 2019 to March 2021. He wrote, \u201cWhen it was noted \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nthat existing contract work would require potential to upgrade to a TS I thought I probably \nshould not use [marijuana].\u201d At the hearing, he confirmed these dates, the estimated \nnumber of times he used marijuana, and his motivation for ceasing his marijuana use in \nabout March 2021 before submitting his May 2021 e-QIP. (Tr. at 40-41, 45-47, 49; GE 1 \nat 35-36.) \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that involves questionable judgment, an \nunwillingness to follow rules and regulations, lack of candor, and dishonesty. The SOR \ncross-alleged under this guideline the two Guideline H allegations described above (SOR \n2.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol (DUI) on two occasions, once in August 2000 and again in \nNovember 2004 (SOR 2.b and 2.c). The SOR sets forth two additional allegations \ninvolving Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the November 2004 DUI arrest in his 2021 e-QIP \nand in a prior e-QIP, certified by Applicant on April 6, 2017 (2017 e-QIP). Applicant \nallegedly falsified his responses under Section 22 - Police Record (EVER) (SOR 2.d and \n2.e) in both e-QIPs. The specific questions also use the unlimited timeframe of \u201cEVER,\u201d \nwith the emphasis in the original e-QIP texts in both the section titles and in the questions.  \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 2.a through \n2.c. He denied the falsification allegations in SOR 2.d and 2.e. He accompanied those \ndenials with explanations. He wrote that the omission of his second DUI arrest in 2004 in \nhis 2017 e-QIP and the omission of both arrests in his 2021 e-QIP was not intentional \nand was due to a misunderstanding. He wrote that he fully disclosed both DUIs during his \nbackground interviews in 2017 and 2021. (Answer at 1-2.) \nApplicant discussed his DUIs in his 2021 background interview. He told the \ninvestigator that his failure to disclose his 2000 DUI in his 2021 e-QIP was due to an \noversight. He disclosed it under questions dealing with alcohol counseling. He also \nreported that he did not disclose the 2004 DUI due to a misunderstanding. (GE 3 at 8-9.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that his failure to completely disclose his DUI \narrests in his two most recent e-QIPs was unintentional. Applicant noted that he disclosed \nhis 2000 DUI in the 2021 e-QIP in response to questions in Section 24 titled \u201cUse of \nAlcohol.\u201d He omitted his 2004 DUI due to a \u201cclerical mistake.\u201d He did not believe he had \nto repeat in his 2021 e-QIP all of the details in his 2017 e-QIP and from his prior \ninvestigations. The record does not contain the summaries of his background interviews \nfrom his prior investigations. In his 2017 e-QIP he disclosed his 2000 arrest, but not his \n2004 arrest. He said that omission was due to a misunderstanding. He also noted that he \nfully disclosed his recent use of marijuana and disclosed his DUI arrests in his background \ninterviews. He also testified that he no longer drinks alcohol because he has developed \nan allergic reaction to alcohol.

The witness has \nknown Applicant since 2009 and has worked closely with him since then. They started \ntheir business together in 2011. The witness believes Applicant has \u201camazing integrity\u201d \nand appreciates Applicant\u2019s honesty since they are partners. He and Applicant have \ndiscussed the differences between Federal law and the law in State A where they both \nlive and work. (Tr. at 21-29.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife also testified. She has known Applicant for 13 years. The first time \nhe smoked marijuana was with her in the summer or fall of 2019. They last used marijuana \ntogether in the first quarter of 2021. She asked Applicant to smoke marijuana with her \nbecause she was nervous and suffering from anxiety. She was experiencing difficulty \nsleeping, and she thought that marijuana might help her condition. She did not want to \nuse marijuana alone. She has seen Applicant use marijuana 30-40 times during the 2019-\nto-2021 period. She continues to use marijuana for her anxiety and has smoked \nmarijuana as recently as a couple of months before the hearing. She does not use the \ndrug in the presence of her husband. She smokes at before bedtime in their garage away \nfrom the couple\u2019s children. (Tr. at 29-36.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his detailed testimony regarding his \nhistory of drug use establish both of the above disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was recent, frequent, and casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He admits that he only stopped using \nmarijuana because the Company\u2019s circumstances had changed and he needed to submit \na new security clearance application to upgrade his clearance. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not \nestablished. \nApplicant acknowledged his drug involvement and has established a pattern of \nabstinence over a period in excess of one year. His wife confirmed that Applicant no \nlonger smokes marijuana. He has not, however, satisfied the evidentiary requirements of \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(1) - (3), in particular subsection 3. AG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially established. \nParagraph 1 of the SOR is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from about August 2019 to about March 2021. During \nthat 19-month period, he was a co-owner and FSO of a defense contractor and held a \nsecurity clearance. He was also twice arrested for and charged with DUI, once in August \n2001 and again in December 2004. The prior arrests combined with the use of marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance suggest questionable judgment and a pattern of \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(c) is established. \nWith respect to the two falsification allegations, the record evidence does not \nestablish that Applicant intentionally provided false responses to questions in the 2017 e-\nQIP and the 2021 e-QIP regarding his DUI arrests that occurred many years earlier. He \ndid disclose the information about his recent marijuana use in his 2021 e-QIP, which is \nmore derogatory and of much greater security significance than two dated misdemeanor \narrests. He may have been quite careless in responding to the questions in Section 22 of \nthe two recent e-QIPs about his police record, but he did not intentionally provide false \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s candor in making the disclosure about his recent drug use \nsupports his credible testimony that he did not deliberately omit the information about his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \narrests in 2000 and 2004 in the e-QIPs. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established with respect to SOR \n2.d and 2.e. \nThe guideline includes a condition in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance and \nhis two DUI arrests: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThis mitigating condition is not established with respect to Applicant\u2019s recent use \nof marijuana while holding a security clearance. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. This condition is established, however, with respect \nto Applicant\u2019s DUI arrests in 2000 and 2004. Those occurrences are too far removed from \nApplicant\u2019s present circumstances to be of any security significance at this time. In light \nof my conclusion regarding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, however, paragraph 2 of the SOR \nis found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence raises questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b through 2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(GEs 1-2) \nSince November 2020, Applicant has worked for his current defense contractor \nas a design engineer. (Item 3) Previously, he worked for other employers in various \njobs. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nRecords document that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2016 through 2020. (Items 4-5) Applicant attributed his tax-filing \nlapses to being an uninformed young student who did not believe the low earnings he \nproduced from his college internships required him to file federal and state income tax \nreturns. (Items 4-5) In his interrogatory response, he assured that (a) he made less than \nthe lowest tax bracket, and (b) his taxes were paid in excess through his withholdings, \nleaving him with no monies owed the IRS. (Items 4-5) \nTo date, Applicant has not taken any cognizable actions to clarify his tax-filing \nsituation with either the IRS or his state of residence. Nor has he provided any \ndocumentation to support his claims.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                    Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

His multiple filing lapses raise trust, \nreliability, and judgment concerns about his current and future ability to manage his \nfinances safely and responsibly. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple tax-filing lapses warrant the application of one of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines. DC \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns, or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d applies to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses, albeit accompanied by explanations of his \nreasons for not filing his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through \n-2020, and require no independent proof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at \nE3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted tax-filing failures \nare fully documented and create judgment issues as well over the management of her \nfinances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing failures are critical to \nan assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR \nCase No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016).  \nWithout any evidence of filed federal and state income tax returns for the years in \nissue (2016-2020), or good cause demonstrated for his multiple failures to file his tax \nreturns for tax years in issue, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions are \navailable to Applicant.

On April 11, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) could not make the necessary affirmative finding to grant \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance and issued an SOR to him detailing security reasons \nunder the guidelines for financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct \n(Guideline E). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nOn April 28, 2022, Applicant provided an answer to the SOR.

He received the FORM on August 1, 2022. The Government \nadvised Applicant that in his response, he could either file objections, furnish \nexplanations, submit additional material, or take advantage of all three options within 30 \ndays of receiving the FORM. On August 19, 2022, Department Counsel indicated he \nhad no objection to Applicant\u2019s undated response to the FORM. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned this case to me on October 3, 2022. \nRulings on Procedure \nIn a footnote on the second page of the FORM, Department Counsel informed \nApplicant that his April 2019 personal subject interview (PSI, Item 6 at 1-4) would be \nexcluded from evidence if he objected to the exhibit. Alternatively, Department Counsel \nadvised him that he could correct, update, or modify the exhibit to improve its clarity or \naccuracy. Applicant objected to his April 2019 PSI because it was unauthenticated by a \ngovernment witness. Pursuant to E3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5220.6, page 52, the April \n2019 PSI is withdrawn from the record. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains four delinquent credit-card accounts.

Regarding the \ncollection account at SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant blamed his daughter for using the credit-card \nand not making the required payments.

The debts came to his \nattention after he executed the e-QIP. \nApplicant is 59 years old and has been married to his second spouse since \nAugust 2013. He has two adult-aged children, ages 38 and 35. He earned college \ncredits from July 2011 to January 2015, without receiving a degree. Since October \n2018, Applicant has been employed as a contract analyst for a defense contractor, \nworking for a federal agency. From January to October 2018, Applicant was a court \nreporter for a federal agency. Applicant\u2019s previous positions were as a customer service \nrepresentative, and a training analyst. From September 2008 to February 2009, \nApplicant was unemployed for four months because of family issues. (Tr. 11-18, 22) \nApplicant served in the United States Army Reserve from August 1983 to May \n2005, receiving an honorable discharge in July 2005.

(Tr. \n18-20, 38, 39) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 This charged off credit-card account was opened in June 2014, \nwith Applicant individually liable in case of default. The last payment activity on the \naccount was in February 2018, with a delinquent balance of $5,742. (Item 3 at 4; Item 4 \nand 4) The account is not posted in the Item 5 credit report, dated June 2022. In \nresponse to a fraud claim filed by Applicant on April 22, 2022, the creditor notified \nApplicant on April 26, 2022, that the account was closed and that derogatory \ninformation would be removed from his credit report. This account is resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 This is a charged-off credit-card account that was opened in \nJanuary 2013, with Applicant assuming individual liability for default. The last activity on \nthe account was April 2018, with a delinquent balance of $20,674. Though no \nsupporting documentation was furnished, Applicant indicated that he filed a fraud claim \nwith this creditor on April 22, 2022.

The last activity on the account was in \nFebruary 2018, with a delinquent balance of $8,487. Applicant claimed he assumed \ncontrol of the account after the 2018 investigation. The documentation presented by \nApplicant is a payment plan schedule that begins in November 2021 and ends in March \n2029. Applicant presented similar repayment documentation for the other listed \naccounts. (Item 3 at 4; Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 4; Response to FORM at 3-8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 This credit-card account was opened in May 2015, with Applicant \nindividually liable in case of default. The last activity on the account was December \n2017, with a delinquent balance of $12,398. Applicant set up a payment plan that calls \nfor monthly payments of $209 from August 2022 through July 2023. (Item 3 at 4; Item 4 \nat 5; item 5 at 6; Response to FORM at 11) \nThe Government credit bureau reports indicate that Applicant\u2019s former and \ncurrent resident addresses match those addresses appearing in his December 2018 e-\nQIP. See, GE 2 at 9-11; GE 3 at 1-3. The credit reports reflect that Applicant has \nseveral other accounts in a current status. (GE 3, 4, 5) \nAt pages 13 and 14 of his response to the FORM, Applicant claimed that the \nunintentional omission of the listed debts from his December 2018 e-QIP was isolated \nand not recent. He contended that he acted responsibly with the creation of payment \nplans once he discovered the delinquent accounts. Applicant averred that he was \ninvolved in credit counseling and provided a one-page flyer from a counseling service \nthanking him for joining. He was contemplating a consolidation loan to show that his \nfinancial accounts were resolved or under control.

In his response to the FORM, Applicant \ndid not provide any information about his yearly or monthly earnings or his financial \npractices, such as whether he has a budget. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe surrounding facts leading to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d accounts \nbecoming delinquent between end of December 2017 and February 2018 support the \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThough three listed accounts became delinquent four to five years ago, the \naccounts are still delinquent, and Applicant has advanced contradictory positions \nregarding his responsibility for the accounts. Applicant\u2019s claim of not knowing about the \naccounts until publication of the SOR in April 2022 is not credible. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to this case because there were no unanticipated \nevents that caused the financial problems. While Applicant provided considerable \ndocumentation of payment plans to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d creditors, he submitted \nno proof that any of the scheduled payments were made under those plans. He \nsubmitted no payment receipts, payment ledgers, or bank statements to show \ncompliance with the schedules. Applicant\u2019s successful challenge of the SOR \u00b6 1(a) \naccount is acknowledged as action that resolved this debt due to the fraudulent nature \nof the account. \nApplicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) because the one-page \ncounseling document does not explain the extent of Applicant\u2019s participation in the \ncounseling service. Applicant\u2019s statement concerning the counseling service provides \nno clear indication that his debts are being resolved or under control. \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an \nunfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation or further processing for national security eligibility.  \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 is: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award, benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn his April 2021 SOR answer, Applicant denied that he deliberately falsified the \nDecember 2018 e-QIP. When an applicant denies he intentionally falsified a \ngovernment form, the falsification must be evaluated with all the direct and \ncircumstantial evidence about an applicant\u2019s statement at the time the omission \noccurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) \nIn his December 2018 e-QIP, Applicant denied that he had delinquent debts. In \nhis April 2021 response to SOR, he denied that he deliberately falsified the listed \ndelinquent debts. However, in his response to the SOR, he provided payment plans for \nthe SOR 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d accounts, which demonstrated in his view, taking \nresponsibility for the delinquent accounts once he discovered their existence. His \nresponse to the FORM also contains his consideration of a loan to consolidate the \ndebts, as well as evaluating legal action to extinguish the debts. Having denied his \nresponsibility in December 2018 for the three debts, including the SOR \u00b6 1.c account \nthat he believed in his daughter was responsible for, then why would he present \nevidence in April 2022 accepting responsibility for the delinquent accounts. I conclude \nfrom Applicant\u2019s conflicting explanations that AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies. \nThe potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment; and  \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is  \nunlikely to recur.  \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is inapplicable because not disclosing the truth on a security form is \nnot a minor event. An applicant is responsible for complete candor during all phases of \nthe security investigation so that the Government can make an informed decision \nconcerning his security qualifications. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent responses to the \ndelinquent accounts during the security investigation raise residual concerns about his \ntrustworthiness and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 59 years and has been married since 2013. He has two adult-age \nchildren. He received an honorable discharge in July 2005, after 22 years in the military. \nHe has been employed as a contract analyst since October 2018. \nThe foregoing favorable evidence is inadequate to prevail over the negative \nevidence of his continuing financial issues. Given the fact that he has held a security \nclearance since 2001, he knew or should have known that full disclosure was required \non the e-QIP. Having considered the entire record from an overall common-sense point \nof view, including the lack of evidence of financial counseling and character evidence, \nthe financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines have not been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

AG \u00b6 24 sets forth the concern, \nas follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classification or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe potentially applicable mitigating factors here are quoted below: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant admitted that she used marijuana with varying frequency from October \n2007 to May 2021, and after being granted public trust eligibility in June 2017 and January \n2020. Facts admitted by an applicant in an SCA, an Answer to a SOR, or in an interview \nrequire no further proof from the Government.

It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility.

The next \ninquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant began using marijuana in \n2007, almost 15 years ago. Therefore, her initial use was long ago. She did, however, \ncontinue that use with varying frequency through May 2021. Her drug use is not mitigated \nby AG \u00b6 26(a).  \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b). That condition has two components. \nFirst, the individual must acknowledge her drug involvement and substance misuse. \nSecond, the individual must establish a \u201cpattern of abstinence.\u201d The condition then lists \nseveral nonexclusive examples of how a pattern could be shown. \nApplicant acknowledged her marijuana use for the first time in her June 24, 2021 \nSCA. There is no temporal component to when that acknowledgement must be made. \nThat is, the timing of the acknowledgement is not prescribed, but its timing may be \nconsidered in weighing the overall evidence. Here, Applicant did acknowledge her \nmarijuana use, albeit quite belatedly. \nThe second component requires an applicant to show a pattern of abstinence. Here, \nApplicant said she no longer associates with the friends with whom she used marijuana \nThat is helpful to her cause. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b) also suggests that providing a signed statement in the \nform described could aid in showing a commitment to abstinence. In her March 31, 2022 \nresponses to interrogatories, Applicant said she had \u201cno intention to use drugs in the \nfuture.\u201d Her statement of future intent, however, is not controlling. The core of AG \u00b6 26(b) \nis whether Applicant has established a pattern of abstinence. Her drug use from October \n2007 to 2021, even if infrequent, was a lengthy period. On balance, her abstinence from \n2021 to the present is not a sufficient period of abstinence to establish a pattern that \nsatisfies AG \u00b6 26(b). Her drug use is not mitigated by AG \u00b6 26(b). \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but also all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and \n(d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for \npersonal conduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d A statement or an omission is false or dishonest when it is made \ndeliberately (knowingly and willfully). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose her previous \nmarijuana use. More specifically, the SOR alleged that she omitted marijuana use from \nher January 4, 2016 SCA, October 29, 2018 SCA, and November 2, 2018 AQPTP. \nApplicant denied those allegations. This alleged conduct falls squarely within AG \u00b6 16(a), \nwhich states in pertinent part: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) states in pertinent part a condition that may mitigate that disqualifying \ncondition: \n[The] individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nApplicant offers two explanations. First, she claims that each of those three \nquestionnaires look back only one year for prior drug use. She then states that she did \nnot use marijuana during those respective one-year periods. The November 2, 2018 \nAQPTP, however, does not look back only one year; it looks back seven years, which \ncaptures drug use in 2011. She stated that \u201cmost of the marijuana use was prior to 2012.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s first explanation has another problem. She would have us believe that \nshe can answer the following questions in the affirmative: \n(1) she remembers precisely that she did not use marijuana during the one year \npreceding her January 4, 2016 SCA? \n(2) she remembers precisely that she did not use marijuana during the one year \npreceding her October 29, 2018 SCA? \n(3) she remembers precisely that she did not use marijuana during the one year \npreceding her November 2, 2018 AQPTP? (Even though that questionnaire \nlooks back seven years.) \nApplicant\u2019s pot-smoking sessions were not formal gatherings. She was with others \nat a friend\u2019s house. It is not credible that she could honestly answer those three questions \nin the affirmative. Moreover, she began her use of marijuana in 2007 for \u201cexperimental\u201d \npurposes. Yet she continued using for years, even though it was \u201cnot a pleasant feeling,\u201d \nand she did \u201cnot enjoy\u201d it. Applicant\u2019 first explanation is not credible. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d response to the AQPTP question is striking. The \nAQPTP asked about her marijuana use going back seven years, that is, from November \n2018 back to November 2011. That seven-year period must have included at least one \nof the 20 times that she used marijuana between October 2007 and May 2021. She was \ntrying to minimize the extent of her drug usage. An honest \u201cYes\u201d answer would have \ndefeated that purpose. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a second explanation. Her omission of marijuana use was simply \nbased on a misunderstanding. She \u201cmisunderstood the [November 2, 2018 AQPTP] \nquestion to be exclusive of marijuana use, given its legalization at the state level at the \ntime [she] completed the form.\u201d The context, however, suggests otherwise. \nEach SCA states at page two its purpose: \n\u201cThe United States Government conducts background investigations . . . to establish that \napplicants either employed by the Government or working for the Government under \ncontract are suitable for the job and/or eligible for a public trust or sensitive position.\u201d \nThe AQPTP stated that it was a \u201csupplement\u201d to the SCAs. Since Applicant digitally \nsigned each form, surely she knew that the forms were to be used by the U.S. \nGovernment, not state governments. \nThere is more context that undermines Applicant\u2019s \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d Each form \nhas the following Certification: \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \nApplicant digitally signed each Certification. That Certification on its face is \ngoverned by federal, not state law. There is not even a hint in any of the documents of \nrecord that state law applies to the federal trustworthiness process. Applicant was granted \npublic trust eligibility in June 2017 and January 2020. She is well aware that the federal \nGovernment holds illegal drug use to be important in the public trust eligibility process. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s education, background, and experience, her \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d is not \ncredible. \nFinally, there is AG \u00b6 17(a) that states in pertinent part a condition that may mitigate \nthe disqualifying conditions that apply here: \n[The] individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nApplicant\u2019s first material omission was in her January 4, 2016 SCA. She made no \nprompt efforts to correct that omission. Her second material omission was in her October \n29, 2018 SCA. She made no prompt efforts to correct that omission. Her third material \nomission was in her November 2, 2018 AQPTP. She made no prompt efforts to correct \nthat omission. In fact, she never made any efforts, let alone prompt ones, to correct her \nthree material omissions. This history shows a pattern of deliberate omissions. She finally \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n               \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanswered truthfully when she was confronted by her June 24, 2021 SCA. AG \u00b6 17(a) \ndoes not apply. \nI find that Applicant made deliberately false omissions, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered whether the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa.

The SOR also \nalleges an auto loan that is $958 past due, with a balance of $35,173, and a loan from a \ncredit union that is $935 past due, with a balance of $1,981.

He stated that his finances were better; he made some \npayments on his delinquent debts; and he planned to pay all of the debts. (Item 5) He \nprovided no documentation in his response to the SOR, and he did not respond to the \nFORM, so more recent information about his finances is not available. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts \nand past-due loans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife losing her job in March \n2019; her inability to find a job during the COVID-19 pandemic; and his taking many \ndays of unpaid leave to help his wife with their baby, who was born in 2018. Those \nevents were largely beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that \u201cthe individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant stated that his finances were better, and he made some payments on \nhis delinquent debts. He provided no documentation that he actually paid or is paying \nany of the SOR debts. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to \nexpect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. \n04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). He indicated that he planned to pay all of the \ndebts. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 50 years old, has never married, and has no children. He cohabitated with a woman (the Cohabitant) from 2004 until September 2020. He currently lives with a new girlfriend. He has a high school diploma and has taken college courses over several years, but has not yet earned a degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1994 and served until 2002 when he was honorably discharged. He then entered the Navy Reserve for two years. He was honorably discharged from the Reserve in 2004. When he served in the Navy he held a Top Secret security clearance for a period and then a Secret clearance. He has also held a Secret clearance while working as a defense contractor. He has worked as an analyst for his current employer since 2007. He seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Tr. at 20- 28; GE 1 at 7-12, 18-19, 29-31.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and has failed to pay his Federal taxes and to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns. The Government alleged that these facts render Applicant potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

The case was assigned to me \non July 26, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice \nof Video Teleconference Hearing on August 10, 2022, scheduling the hearing for \nSeptember 19, 2022. The case was heard as scheduled. \nAt the hearing the Government offered six exhibits marked as Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. I marked the three documents he \nattached to the Answer as AE C through E. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. I kept the record open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional documentation. On September 26, 2022, he provided three additional \ndocuments, which I marked as AE F through H and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 26, 2022. (Tr. at 9-19.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 50 years old, has never married, and has no children. He cohabitated \nwith a woman (the Cohabitant) from 2004 until September 2020. He currently lives with a \nnew girlfriend. He has a high school diploma and has taken college courses over several \nyears, but has not yet earned a degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1994 and served \nuntil 2002 when he was honorably discharged. He then entered the Navy Reserve for two \nyears. He was honorably discharged from the Reserve in 2004. When he served in the \nNavy he held a Top Secret security clearance for a period and then a Secret clearance. \nHe has also held a Secret clearance while working as a defense contractor. He has \nworked as an analyst for his current employer since 2007. He seeks to retain national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Tr. at 20-\n28; GE 1 at 7-12, 18-19, 29-31.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and has failed to pay his Federal taxes and to \ntimely file his Federal and state income tax returns. The Government alleged that these \nfacts render Applicant potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR lists five allegedly past-due consumer debts \nthat have been referred to collection or charged off. The total amount of these debts is \n$32,755. The SOR also alleged three years of delinquent Federal tax debts in the total \namount of about $5,500 for tax years (TYs) 2018, 2019, and 2020. Lastly, the SOR \nalleged that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2019 \nand 2020. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this guideline \nexcept one (SOR 1.e), which is a debt he asserted he had paid. He also wrote that he \npaid SOR debt 1.d and his delinquent Federal taxes and that he has filed his Federal and \nstate tax returns for TYs 2019 and 2020.

Credit union credit-card account charged off in the amount of $15,244. \nApplicant defaulted on paying the monthly payments in 2018 during a period of financial \ndistress. He has made calls to the credit union about this debt and the debts owed to the \nsame credit union listed in subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c, but he has not taken any significant \nsteps to repay this debt. He intends to do what is necessary to take care of these three \ndebts. The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a is not resolved. (Tr. at 28-31, 68; GE 2 at 4; \nGE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5.) \n1.b. Credit union credit-card account charged off in the approximate amount of \n$9,356. Applicant defaulted on paying the monthly payments in 2018 during a period of \nfinancial distress. He has not taken any significant steps to repay this debt. This debt is \nnot resolved. (Tr. at 28-31; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5.) \n1.c. Credit union debt-consolidation loan account charged off in the approximate\namount of $7,961. \n \nApplicant defaulted on paying the monthly loan payments in 2019 \nduring a period of financial distress. He has not taken any significant steps to repay this \ndebt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 28-33; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5.) \n1.d. Medical collection account in the approximate amount of $150. Applicant paid \nthis debt over the phone in May 2022. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 34-35; GE 3 \nat 3; GE 4 at 6.) \n1.e. Communication service provider account in collection in the approximate\namount of $44. \n \nThis account became delinquent after Applicant prepared his e-QIP. \nApplicant paid this debt in January 2021. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 35-36; GE \n3 at 3.)  \n1.f. Delinquent Federal tax debt for TY 2018 in the approximate amount of $2,475. \nThis tax debt and the debts alleged in SOR 1.g and 1.h were the result of Applicant under-\nwithholding taxes on his income and changes in the tax law. Applicant resolved this tax \ndebt with a credit from a prior tax year and a payment in March 2022 of $572. This debt \nhas been resolved. (Tr. at 37-44; AE G at 1-2.)  \n1.g. Delinquent Federal tax debt for TY 2019 in the approximate amount of $2,313. \nApplicant resolved this tax debt with payments in April and September 2022. This debt \nhas been resolved. (Tr. at 37-44; AE B; AE H at 1-2.) \n1.h. Delinquent Federal tax debt for TY 2020 in the approximate amount of $728. \nApplicant resolved this tax debt with payments in March and September 2022. This debt \nhas been resolved. (Tr. at 37-44; AE B; AE F at 1-2.)  \n1.i Failure to timely file Federal and state tax returns in TYs 2019 and 2020. \nApplicant blamed his failure to file his tax returns on time for these two years on his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial problems at that time. The Cohabitant was not able to contribute any significant \nfunds to the couple\u2019s expenses and those expenses fell mostly on Applicant. He was \noverwhelmed. He filed his TY 2019 returns on September 12, 2022 and his TY 2020 \nreturns on August 29, 2022. (Tr. at 46-48; AE F; AE H.)  \nApplicant testified that he experienced financial problems due to poor money \nmanagement and to the financial demands made by the Cohabitant. He bought a house \nand was having difficulties paying his bills because he was living beyond his means. The \nCohabitant lost her job and had to take a lower paying job. She was also on disability for \none year after being diagnosed as bipolar. He had tax problems due to an early \nwithdrawal from his retirement account in 2017. In 2020 he borrowed money from his \n401k to pay his 2017 tax debt that resulted from the early withdrawal from his 401k \naccount. The IRS was threatening to impose a lien on his house at that time. Later in \n2020 he sold the house and received about $100,000 of net proceeds from the sale. He \ngave the Cohabitant $40,000, even though the house was in his name. He was unable to \nprovide an explanation as to why he did not resolve his other debts with the remaining \nsales proceeds. He said that with the sale of the house in which he lived with the \nCohabitant and the end of that relationship, he just \u201ctook a break.\u201d He is trying to get his \nlife back together following the end of that long-term relationship in 2019 and 2020. His \nlife has improved since he separated from the Cohabitant. (Tr. at 21-30, 33, 36-41.) \nApplicant filed his TY 2021 tax returns about a week before the hearing. He did not \nfile for extensions so the returns were untimely. That fact was not alleged in the SOR \nbecause the delinquencies post-date the SOR. He owed the Federal Government about \n$4,500 for TY 2021. He recently mailed a check to the IRS to pay that tax debt. (Tr. at 45-\n48.)  \nApplicant presently has about $22,000 in savings. His monthly take home pay is \nabout $4,000. He recently moved in with a new girlfriend, who has a significant salary. He \ncontributes $700 to their living expenses and she pays the rest. He owns his car. He has \nabout $3,000 of net disposable income after expenses. He can afford a payment plan \nwith the credit union if it was willing to accept one. He has not explored that possibility \nyet. He recognizes that he has to change his tax withholding to make sure he covers his \nyearly tax obligations. He has not done so or taken other necessary actions on his \nfinances because he \u201chit a wall\u201d in the 2017-2019 period and is just starting to recover \nwith the help and support of his new girlfriend. He said, \u201cI just had some really bad years.\u201d \nHe claims that he used to be financially responsible. At one point since 2018, he sought \nthe help of a debt relief company to assist him to pay and resolve his debts, but he rejected \ntheir proposal. He has not received any financial counseling. (Tr. at 51-53, 69.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe details regarding the single SOR allegation set forth in paragraph 2 are as \nfollows: \n2.a September 2020 arrest and charge of Driving Under the Influence of alcohol \n(DUI). Applicant had a minor accident when he failed to navigate a turn properly near his \nhome after staying up all night. Earlier in the evening, he had been drinking alcohol. When \nhe was driving home, he felt that he was more tired than intoxicated. The sheriff was \ncalled. Applicant registered a 0.10% blood alcohol content even though he had not had a \ndrink in several hours. He was arrested and charged with DUI. He was convicted of the \noffense of Wet and Reckless. The court sentenced Applicant to one year of probation. He \nsuccessfully completed all of the terms of his probation, and it expired in May 2022. He \nalso completed all of the state DMV requirements to maintain his driver\u2019s license. \nApplicant is very aware that the consequences of a second similar offense in his state will \nbe much more severe. This was his first DUI arrest, and he has not had any similar arrests \nsince September 2020. At this point he rarely drinks to excess. He has a couple of glasses \nof wine two nights a week with his new girlfriend. He does not drink and drive. He \ndescribes his 2020 accident and arrest as \u201cisolated.\u201d He has never been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder. (Tr. at 54-61; GE 5.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government cross alleged its Guideline J allegation in a single allegation \nunder the guideline regarding Alcohol Consumption. See the discussion under that \nguideline, above. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nas required. \nAs of the date of the SOR, Applicant owed approximately $32,500 for three past-\ndue debts. The record evidence also established that he failed to file his TYs 2019 and \n2020 Federal and state income tax returns as required. These facts establish the \nforegoing potentially disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised under this guideline. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been fully established. The behavior \nis recent and Applicant\u2019s continued indebtedness to the credit union on three significant \ndebts has not been addressed even though he has the sufficient savings and net monthly \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nincome to do so. Applicant\u2019s failure to address these debts over several years casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. The circumstances of the Cohabitant\u2019s \nloss of income and the end of Applicant\u2019s relationship with her are circumstances beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. His failure to resolve his credit union debts and his failure to file his \ntax returns in a timely manner, however, evidences that he did not act responsibly under \nthe circumstances since the end of that relationship in 2020. Applicant has not received \ncredit counseling and there are no clear indications that his financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. His payments of two small debts and his tax debts for TYs \n2018 through 2020, all of which occurred after the SOR was issued, does not constitute \na good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors. Also he has taken no good-faith actions \nto repay the debts owed to the credit union. Lastly, Applicant\u2019s payment of his past-due \ntaxes and his filing of his tax returns provide some mitigation, but the fact that the returns \nwere filed just a few weeks before the hearing significantly undercuts the extent of that \nmitigation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s one conviction for Wet and Reckless does not constitute \u201ca pattern of \nminor offenses.\u201d The facts in this case do not meet the threshold requirement under this \ndisqualifying condition of multiple minor offenses. AG \u00b6 31(a) is not established. However, \nAG \u00b6 31(b) is established by the Applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction for excessive drinking \nand driving. This evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under this guideline. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \nApplicant has established both of the above mitigating conditions. While it was \nrelatively recent, Applicant\u2019s single offense was also isolated, and the circumstances \nunder which it occurred were unusual and unlikely to recur. Applicant no longer drinks \nand drives because he knows that the penalties for a second DUI offense would be severe \nand would negatively impact his life. This offense does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Also, there is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. Two years have passed since Applicant\u2019s DUI arrest and there has been \nno further criminal conduct. He fully complied with the terms of his probation, and he is \nno longer on probation. He has a good employment record, as evidenced by his 15-year \nwork history with his current employer. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 3 - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following potentially disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 22 applies to the facts \nof this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \nApplicant\u2019s one arrest for DUI and his conviction for Wet and Reckless does not \nestablish the above potentially disqualifying condition, which by its terms requires more \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthan one incident. The Government has not met its burden to establish a security concern \nunder Guideline G arising from this single DUI arrest. Paragraph 3 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of facts established under the guidelines alleged in the SOR and \nthe whole-person concept. I have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines F, J, and G in my whole-person analysis. \nFurther comments are warranted. Applicant\u2019s lack of effort to resolve his three debts with \nthe credit union even after he received the SOR in April 2022 and his filing of his tax \nreturns for TYs 2019 and 2020 just a few weeks before the hearing reflects a serious lack \nof effort to address the Government\u2019s security concerns. The fact that he did not file his \nTY 2021 return in a timely manner and has not adjusted his Federal tax withholding to \navoid future tax debts reflects that he has not changed his ways and committed to take \nhis tax obligations seriously. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He said he did not attempt to hide his debts \nor information from the government. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts. In 2013, he filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy and discharged $35,777 of debt. Between 2018 and 2021, he incurred more \nthan $42,000 in delinquent debts that he has been unable to resolve. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts, totaling over $42,000, are recent and ongoing. He \nfailed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). His periods of unemployment and the loss \nof his wife\u2019s income may have been circumstances beyond his control; however, he did \nnot present evidence that he attempted to responsibly manage those debts while they \nwere accumulating or after he resumed employment. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. There \nis no evidence that he participated in credit or budget counseling. There are no clear \nindications that any of the debts are being resolved through payment plans or are under \ncontrol. Although his budget includes payments on five financial accounts, none of those \naccounts appears to be included in the SOR. The record does not establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted that he did not disclose his 13 delinquent debts in his \nSeptember 2021 SCA, but denied that he deliberately omitted them with intent to deceive. \nHe stated that he was confused by the language of the questions and the timeframe of \nseven years. In January 2022, he answered interrogatories inquiring about the status of \nthe13 delinquent debts that were reported on his October 2021 CBR and subsequently \nalleged in the March 2022 SOR. Based on his denials, his confusion in understanding the \nfinancial questions in the SCA, and his complete answers to the interrogatories, there is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that he deliberately concealed information from the \ngovernment. He sufficiently refuted the allegation under this guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n__________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant experienced financial \nproblems prior to filing his 2013 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and again about five years later. \nAlthough he provided a budget that indicates he has money remaining at the end of the \nmonth, there is no evidence that he is using some of it to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nHe did not submit evidence of financial or credit counseling. At this time, he has not \nestablished a track record of addressing delinquent debts and managing financial \nobligations. The evidence leaves me with questions and concerns as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. He refuted those concerns alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

He is married and has four children. He has been \nemployed as a chief technical officer since August 2010. He reports no military service. \n(Item 3) Applicant has held a security clearance for more than a decade. He completed \nhis latest security clearance application (SCA) on May 5, 2021. \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about January 2000, to the present (1.a); used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from 2014 to the present, while granted access to classified information 1.b; \nwas arrested in about August 2005 and charged with possession of marijuana (1.c); and \nintends to continue using marijuana in the future. (1.d) In his Answer, Applicant admitted \nthe SOR allegations under Guideline H with explanations. The SOR alleged, under \nGuideline E, that Applicant falsified his March 9, 2011 SCA by failing to report his full \nillegal drug usage in the last seven years in response to Section 23. (2.a); and his \nJanuary 26, 2010 SCA by stating that his 2005 arrest was the only time that he had \nused marijuana (2.b); and it also cross alleged the information from SOR 1.b and 1.d. \nApplicant admitted the Guideline E allegations with explanations. (Item 1) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b61.a through \n1.d, as stated above. He stated that his occasional use of marijuana did not \ncompromise his reliability, trustworthiness, integrity, or dedication to the United States. \nHe emphasized that he never used or had been under the influence during work or \nwhile accessing classified information. He claimed that he stopped using marijuana \ncompletely from about 2011 to 2014, while working for the Federal Government. He \nstated that he stopped due to agency regulations. Applicant emphasized that his arrest \noccurred over 15 years ago and that the record was expunged over ten years ago. He \nfurther noted that this was the only incident he ever had with law enforcement. In the \nfinal part of his answer, he stated that his expected use will be \u201cconsistent with past use, \nwhich will be occasional and limited.\u201d Applicant stated that \u201chis openness and honesty \nabout his past, present, and future use of marijuana should prove that he is trustworthy \nand deserving of a favorable determination.\u201d (Item 2) \nAs to the SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c, Applicant admitted that he only \ndisclosed on his 2011 SCA the 2005 arrest for marijuana but not the other times he \nused marijuana. It was his understanding that the use of marijuana would always result \nin an unfavorable adjudication. He was \u201cworried that if he answered \u201cYes\u201d, he would not \nreceive a clearance and lose his job, not be able to take care of his family or pay his \nmortgage. (Item 2) \nApplicant completed his most recent SCA on May 5, 2021. (Item 3) He disclosed \ntwo decades of marijuana use and indicated his intent to cease his further use of \nmarijuana\u201d on an unspecified date in the future, as he values his clearance above the \noccasional use of marijuana.

(Item 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to his first SCA in 2010, he disclosed his 2005 arrest for \npossession of marijuana and resisting arrest, as required. (Item 5). Ultimately dismissed \nand expunged from Applicant\u2019s record, he expressed embarrassment over this incident \nin his answer. He stated that he was hanging out with the wrong people and committed \nto staying away from marijuana. \u201cI have not and will not make the bad decisions that put \nme in that situation again.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s March 2011 SCA he reiterated the same \nconcerning his marijuana use on the 2010 SCA.  (Items 4, 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to FORM through counsel, he admitted that he felt sick \nand disappointed with himself for using marijuana again after he decide to stay away \nfrom marijuana. On the January 2010 SCA, he only reported the 2005 arrest for \npossession of marijuana and not the total use. (Item 6); and that he again reported \ninaccurately on his March 2011 SCA; and that he was granted a secret clearance and \nstated that he did not use marijuana at that time. He also indicated that he did not use \nmarijuana for a period but then resumed use in mid-2014. He noted that his clearance \nwas deactivated from February 2018 through April 2020. On his May 5, 2021, SCA, \nApplicant characterized all of his marijuana use as recreational and asserted that he \nceased use from 2010 through 2014. (Item 3 and Item 6) \nApplicant noted that he is the primary earner in his family and is engaged with \nthe community. He coaches his son\u2019s baseball team and volunteers. (Item 6) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his \n2010 and 2011 SCA by deliberately failing to disclose the full use of his illegal use of \nmarijuana that he illegally used for 20 years. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. The SOR also cross \nalleged the information set forth in SOR 1.b and 1.d. Applicant admitted the E \nallegations and that he was intending to use marijuana in the future. (Item 2) He \nbelieves it does not affect his judgment or reliability and that the Government should not \nbe concerned. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish that he used marijuana as alleged in the SOR \nfor nearly two decades and while holding a security clearance. The record also \nestablishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after being employed with a Federal \ncontractor and after completing his earlier security clearance application; a 2005 arrest \nfor marijuana possession; and Applicant\u2019s statement that he would continue to use it \nrecreationally. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he knew that his position with a federal \ncontactor required him to refrain from using illegal drugs shows a reckless disregard for \nrules and regulations. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse, AG \u00b6 \n25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \u2026 purchase or sale; AG \u00b6 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n25(f) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. The Government\u2019s \nsubstantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, thus raises security \nconcerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2020. He \nhas just recently stated that he would abstain from marijuana use because it is a \ntangible threat to his security clearance. He believes his open and honest response to \nhis to his 2021 SCA should prove that he is trustworthy. He argued that although he has \nbeen an active drug user for 20 years and is finally forthright, the Government should \nignore the former illegal marijuana use. This does not mitigate his case. This conduct \ncasts doubt about his judgment and reliability. I find that none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant admitted that he intentionally falsified his 2010 and 2011 SCAs \nregarding the extent of his drug use. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted each \nallegation, but believes they should be mitigated by his disclosures on his 2021 SCA, \nand that he now deserves a favorable determination. Applicant also stated that he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwould continue his recreational use in his answer to the SOR. I find that Applicant \nintentionally falsified material facts on his March 2011 and January 2010 SCAs by \ndeliberately minimizing his illegal drug use. He knowingly violated federal law and \nagency policy for his own personal benefit. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant provided false information because he feared he would lose a security \nclearance. He falsified two separate SCAs. He made no effort to correct the \nfalsifications until his 2021 SCA because he did not want to lose his job and needed the \nsecurity clearance. The offenses are not minor, and he believes now that he has \nanswered questions accurately he should be rewarded with a security clearance. His \nlack of candor and inconsistent statements cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. He has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the personal \nconduct concerns. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. I find none \nof the mitigating conditions apply in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the record. \nI have doubts as to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. Under these circumstances, I find \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under drug involvement and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nsubstance misuse, nor under personal conduct due to intentional falsification of his \n2010 and 2011 SCAs.

There were no objections \nto the Government Items or AE A, and they are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on October 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 64 years old. He is a college graduate. He has worked for a federal \ncontractor since 1982. He married in 1996 and has two children, ages 24 and 22. \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - $1,384; 1.b - $30,717; 1.c - $1,800; \n1.d - $167; 1.e - $8,758) that Applicant admitted in his SOR answer that he owes.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he \nowed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He said that due to medical bills he had to use this credit \ncard. He stated he had not made a payment on the card since 2015. He had received \noffers to settle the debt for approximately $8,000. He stated, \u201cMy plan is to hold on for \nanother year of two due to the likely/sadly inheritance that will resolve all debts.\u201d He did \nnot disclose any other delinquent debts in his SCA. (Item 3) \nIn June 2020, a government investigator interviewed Applicant. The investigator \naddressed the debts with him that are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e. He told the \ninvestigator that the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was due to his wife being laid off, \nmedical bills, and deaths in the family that he incurred large travel expenses. He said he \nintended to pay all of these debts. He said he had been \u201csloppy\u201d with his debt payments, \nbut felt he had a safety net with his father and would pay the debts in full when his father \npassed away, and he gets his inheritance. His father was 88 years old at that time. He \nwas also confronted with the smaller debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, which he said he had not been \naware of, and he would pay it as soon as he could contact the creditor. (Item 7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2022 answer to the SOR, he stated: \nAt face value, this is embarrassing for me to see this list of significant old \ndebt and smaller billing discrepancies between myself and the collection \nagencies/original service companies. Fortunately, I\u2019m at a point in time \nwhere I can quickly eliminate all of these debts. (Item 2) \n \n* * * \nFor the four smaller amounts (line items 1, 3, 4 and 6) I have now and will \nsoon pay them all off. These were either overlooked or disputed bills that I \nwill quickly take care of to clear them from my credit report.

He had to reach out to his father in the past \nto help him handle large unexpected bills or revenue loss when his wife lost her job. He \nsaid that his father considered his financial help as an advance to his son\u2019s eventual \ninheritance. Regarding the two credit cards debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e, \nApplicant said that due to the amount of these debts, he knew they would not go away, \nbut he did not have the money to pay them. He said that as his father approached his 90th  \nbirthday, he father disclosed the amount of the inheritance his children would receive. His \nfather has since passed away and his sister is the executor of the father\u2019s estate. He \nstated that the family trust was 80% complete in distributing funds to the children who are \nthe beneficiaries. Applicant said he was \u201cunwinding the various positions the trust account \nwas invested in\u201d and planned to eliminate all of the debt in the SOR. (Item 2) \nApplicant further stated in his SOR answer, \u201cI\u2019ve always known that I would \nconstantly be able to handle my debts by reaching out to my father as needed or \neventually receive the inheritance.\u201d (Item 2) Therefore, Applicant did not believe he would \nbe vulnerable due to his debts or that his reliability or trustworthiness would be in question. \nHe stated that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, a past-due amount on his mortgage, had been paid. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2022 credit report shows the debt is past due. Applicant did not provide \nany documentary evidence with his SOR answer to show he has paid or resolved any of \nthe alleged debts. (Items 2, 4) \nThe debts in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR \nanswer, disclosures in his SCA, admissions to the government investigator, admissions \nin his response to the FORM, and credit reports from March 2022, January 2022, and \nApril 2020. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he noted that the investigator included in the \nsummary of his interview that there was nothing in Applicant\u2019s background, lifestyle or \nconduct, which could subject him to coercion or blackmail. This comment was not the \nopinion or findings of the government investigator, but was rather the answer Applicant \nprovided to the investigator in response to the inquiry about his delinquent debts and past. \n(AE A) \nAs he said in his SOR answer, Applicant also stated in his response to the FORM \nthat he was current on the past-due payments on his mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a), but he did \nnot provide documentary proof. He stated that the creditor on the credit card debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b had not contacted him or attempted to collect the debt. He said: \nI will absolutely pay the full unpaid balance. Due to the unknown tax impact \nof liquidating the various types of investment I inherited from my father\u2019s \ntrust, final remediation has been delayed. That said, this unpaid balance bill \nbe paid in full before year-end.

SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e are not \nresolved. (AE A) \nApplicant stated in his FORM response that he researched the creditor in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c and said that company clearly had run a fraudulent business. He provided no further \nexplanation. He admitted he owed the debt and did not explain if he had been a victim of \nfraud. He said that he felt that paying them only enables their fraudulent business, but \nbecause the debt had an impact on his security clearance, he would pay it. He did not \nprovide proof that he paid it. (AE A) \nApplicant stated he does not know who the creditor is for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, \nbut he contacted the account holder in the allegation and was told the debt had been \n\u201czeroed out as of 7/18/22.\u201d (AE A) He said he was told the line item would be removed \nfrom his credit report and he considered this line item closed. Regarding the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.f, he said that he still needs to resolve this debt and would figure out a way to track \ndown the creditor and pay the $138. These debts are not resolved. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent debts totaling approximately $42,964 that began \naccumulating in 2015. He stated he was waiting for his father to pass, and he would use \nhis expected inheritance to pay the debts. Two years after he said this, his father passed \naway. He has not provided evidence that he has paid the debts alleged in the SOR. He \nis now waiting so he can determine the tax consequences of his inheritance before paying \nhis delinquent debts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documentary \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant failed to provide documentary proof that he paid any of the alleged \ndelinquent debts.

Applicant \ndisclosed his large credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in his SCA (January 2020) and said he \nwas waiting for his father to pass to receive an inheritance to pay it. He essentially said \nthe same thing to the government investigator in June 2020 and had disclosed he has not \nmade a payment on this debt since 2015. Then in his 2022 SOR answer, he said his \nfather had passed, and he was waiting for the full distribution of assets. In his answer to \nthe FORM, he said he is now waiting to determine the tax consequences of his \ninheritance. \nI find none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent and his \ndebts remain ongoing and unpaid. Based on his past conduct, I cannot find future issues \nare unlikely to recur. His conduct casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nApplicant told the investigator that his wife lost her job and there were medical \npayments that contributed to his credit card debts and he had not made a payment on \none credit card since 2015. These things were beyond his control. For the application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. It has been \nseven years since these events affected Applicant\u2019s finances. His reliance on a future \ninheritance to resolve his debts is not acting responsibly. In addition, even after his father \npassed away and he received his inheritance, he still has not resolved his debts. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant chose to let his creditors wait for their payments until his father passed \naway and he received his inheritance. Although he said he resolved some of the alleged \ndebts, he did not provide any evidence to support his assertions. Delaying payments for \nyears on debts, based on an event that will happen sometime in the future, the death of \nhis father, is not a good-faith effort to pay overdue creditors. Further, Applicant\u2019s father is \nnow deceased and he has yet to show any progress on resolving his debts. There is no \nevidence of financial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant admitted he owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He said he paid it, but did not \nprovide proof. He said he was reluctant to pay it because he thought the company was \ninvolved in fraudulent business practices. He provided no evidence that he was \ndefrauded. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial considerations security \nconcerns remain. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant made a conscious decision that he would delay paying his creditors while \nhe waited for his father to pass away sometime in the unknown future and use his \ninheritance to resolve his delinquent debts. He made no effort to make payment \narrangements or attempt to settle his debts for years. Even after receiving his inheritance, \nhe still has not paid his larger debts, again delaying his financial obligations. His conduct \nshows an incredible lack of judgment. His financial track record is one of procrastination \nand failure to take responsibility for paying his debts. \nApplicant has repeatedly stated that he intends to pay his delinquent debts in the \nfuture. First, it was after his father died, then he had to wait for the final distribution on \nassets, and then it was because he had tax consequences to consider. Applicant\u2019s \nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant said he resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c and 1.d. I noted he failed \nto provide documentary proof that the debts are paid. However, even if he did provide \nthose documents and those three debts were mitigated, his past actions by delaying \npaying his debts until he received an inheritance represents serious concerns about his \nreliability and good judgment. Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.g as a duplicate debt. Her admissions are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. As discussed below, this case resulted from a 2021 credit report of Applicant\u2019s that was noted through the DOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation Program. Applicant\u2019s biographical information is largely taken from her July 2016 security clearance application (SCA), as no later SCA is available. She is 39 years old. She has never married and she has no children. She graduated from high school in 2000. She earned an associate degree in 2004 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. She has worked as a cleared federal contractor since August 2006, and for her current employer and clearance sponsor since October 2008. She works as an executive assistant. Since December 2015, she has also worked part-time as a receptionist at a salon. (Item 3; AE 4) 2 Applicant\u2019s 2016 background investigation (July 2016 SCA, September 2016 credit report, and August 2017 interview) indicated no delinquencies. (Items 3, 4, 8) The SOR is based on credit reports from January 2021 and March 2022, which list delinquent accounts totaling about $54,000. (Items 5, 6, 7) The SOR concerns seven alleged delinquent debts, totaling about $47,787. (One debt is alleged twice, so the more accurate amount is about $42,000). All of the accounts are con",

(Item 1) The DOD CAF issued the SOR under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 18, 2022, and elected to have her case \ndecided by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on the administrative (written) record, instead of a hearing. (Item 2) With her SOR \nresponse, she also provided several documents, which I have identified as Answer \nAttachments A through F. \nOn June 30, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 8. DOHA \nmailed the FORM to Applicant on July 12, 2022, and she received it on July 18, 2022. \nOn August 12, 2022, Applicant e-mailed DOHA and provided a response to the \nFORM (FORM Response), along with three Enclosures. (Applicant Enclosures (AE) 1, 2, \nand 3) Her August 12, 2022 correspondence continued an e-mail chain that included an \nApril 18, 2022 e-mail to DOHA in which Applicant provided a two-paragraph narrative \nstatement. (Item 1A) She did not note any objections to the Government\u2019s FORM Items. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 3, 2022, for a decision on the written \nrecord. On October 28, 2022, I e-mailed the parties and indicated that, having reviewed \nthe record in the case, I was re-opening the record to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence, with a deadline of November 14, 2022. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) \n1). She made a timely submission providing two recommendation letters, documentation \nrelating to her debt payments, and a monthly budget. Those documents are marked as \nAE 3 through 7. \nFORM Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. FORM Items 2 through 8 are \nadmitted without objection as Government exhibits. SOR Answer Attachments A through \nF, FORM Response 1A, and FORM Response Documents AE 1 through 7 are all \nadmitted without objection as Applicant exhibits. The record closed on November 14, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, and \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.g as a duplicate debt. Her admissions are included in the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nAs discussed below, this case resulted from a 2021 credit report of Applicant\u2019s that \nwas noted through the DOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation Program. Applicant\u2019s biographical \ninformation is largely taken from her July 2016 security clearance application (SCA), as \nno later SCA is available. She is 39 years old. She has never married and she has no \nchildren. She graduated from high school in 2000. She earned an associate degree in \n2004 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. She has worked as a cleared federal contractor \nsince August 2006, and for her current employer and clearance sponsor since October \n2008. She works as an executive assistant. Since December 2015, she has also worked \npart-time as a receptionist at a salon.

(Items 3, 4, 8) The SOR \nis based on credit reports from January 2021 and March 2022, which list delinquent \naccounts totaling about $54,000. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nThe SOR concerns seven alleged delinquent debts, totaling about $47,787. (One \ndebt is alleged twice, so the more accurate amount is about $42,000). All of the accounts \nare consumer credit accounts that have been charged off. This includes SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($16,082), 1.b ($5,648), 1.c ($7,703), 1.d ($9,809), 1.e ($1,627), and 1.f ($1,270). SOR \u00b6 \n1.g ($5,648) is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.b, as it is for the same amount, and owed to the \nsame creditor. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nWith her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided an agreement with a debt relief \ncompany (DRC) she engaged in April 2019. She was to pay $1,000 a month to the DRC \nfor resolution and settlement of her debts. She enrolled 13 creditors, with almost $65,000 \nin combined debt. All of the SOR debts are included in the agreement. (Answer Att. F and \nExhibit A thereto) \nAs of April 2022, when Applicant answered the SOR, she had resolved all but three \nof the debts through the debt relief program. (Answer Att. A) Applicant also provided \nseveral IRS 1099-C Forms reflecting the cancellation of several other debts in 2021. \nThese cancellations totaled about $12,470. (Answer Att. B, C, D, and E). \nLittle is known about the origin of the debts, but Applicant noted in FORM \nResponse that, \u201cIn early 2019, I realized that making the minimum payments on my credit \ncards and unsecured loans would not be the best way of paying off my debt.\u201d (Item 1A). \nThrough the DRC program, she has made regular $500 payments twice a month since \nMay 2019, except the month of October 2020, when she changed jobs. (FORM \nResponse, Item 1A) She documented numerous bi-monthly recurring deposits from her \nchecking account from May 2019 through July 2022. (FORM Response Enclosure 2) \nAs of July 2022, nine of the 13 accounts in the DRC debt relief program had been \npaid off (including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f), three were in the process of repayment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.c, and 1.d), and one (SOR \u00b6 1.a, the largest debt) was in the process of being \nnegotiated. Applicant expects to complete the payment and fully resolve her debts in May \n2024. (FORM Response Enclosure 1; FORM Response Item 1A) \nApplicant noted the status of the various accounts enrolled in the DRC debt relief \nprogram in margin notes in FORM Response Enclosure 1. Since that information was not \nindependently verified, I reopened the record to allow her the opportunity to provide \ncorroborating documentation. (HE 1) \nIn response, Applicant provided updated information in November 2022. SOR \u00b6 \n1.b is under a settlement agreement for $4,237. SOR \u00b6 1.c is under a settlement \nagreement for $2,559. SOR \u00b6 1.d is under a settlement agreement for $4,905.

(AE 6) No new information was provided for SOR \u00b6 1.a \n($16,082), beyond the prior indication that the debt was being negotiated by the DRC. \nWith her FORM Response, Applicant also had provided documentation that, as of \nJuly 2022, she had almost $133,000 in her company IRA account (subject to market \nfluctuation). She has not used those funds to address her debts, given the taxes and \npenalties that would result from an early withdrawal, but they are available to her. She \nalso noted that the DRC has provided financial education to her on better use of credit \ncards and loans to avoid large debt in the future. (FORM Response and Enclosure 3) \nApplicant also provided a budget for November 2022. It shows $5,644 in income \n($4,884 per month from her full-time job and $760 per month from her part-time job at the \nsalon) and $4,091 in expenses, including her debt payments, credit card and loan \npayments, rent, and other regular monthly expenses (including insurance, utilities, \nentertainment, charitable gifts, and gas). (AE 7) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors at both of her jobs provided strong recommendations. Ms. \nH has known Applicant since Applicant was a teenager. She later worked her way through \ncollege, and later became Ms. H\u2019s executive assistant in a cleared DOD position. \nApplicant has her total confidence and Applicant has the discretion, decision-making, and \nability to work well with others that is required for the job. Ms. H would trust Applicant with \nher life, secrets, possessions, and her family. (AE 4) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at the salon also credited her professionalism, and noted \nthat he entrusts her to handle cash and credit card transactions regularly, as well as \nsensitive client information. He has also entrusted her with caring for family pets in their \nhome when they are on vacation. (AE 5) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant fell behind on her debts in early 2019, when she realized that making \nminimum payments on her loans and credit cards was insufficient to address them. Her \ndebts are established by her admissions and by credit reports in the record, from 2021 \nand 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nWhen Applicant realized she was falling behind in paying her credit cards and \nloans, she voluntarily entered into a debt repayment agreement with a debt consolidation \ncompany. She did so in April 2019, well before her clearance eligibility became an issue. \nShe has been making regular, bimonthly payments towards her debts since May 2019. \nAll of her debts, whether alleged in the SOR or otherwise, have either been paid or are \nbeing paid, with one exception \u2013 the largest debt remaining in the plan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and \nthe DRC is negotiating with that creditor to arrange a settlement. She also has a \nreasonable budget that addresses her debts and expenses. Applicant\u2019s debts are not yet \nfully resolved, so AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. \nHowever, both AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) fully apply. As she notes in her answer to \nthe SOR and in her FORM Response, Applicant initiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay her overdue creditors and otherwise resolve her debts. She has also \nreceived financial counseling from the DRC about how to avoid financial issues in the \nfuture, and her debts are being resolved and are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern \nshown by her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to her continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j and denied the allegation in 1.k. In her FORM response, she amended her answer and admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of facts. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 34 years old. She has cohabitated since 2010 and has a 10-year-old child. She served on active duty in the military from 2007 to 2011, and received an honorable discharge. She then served in the Army National Guard from 2012 to 2016, and was honorably discharged. Applicant attended technical school from 2011 to 2012 and earned an associate\u2019s degree. She attended community college from 2013 to 2015 and earned two additional associate\u2019s degrees. She was unemployed while she was a student.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 28, 2022, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on June 14, \n2022.

Applicant submitted a response to the FORM and provided \ndocuments. She did not object to any of the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 4 through 9 \nare admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s documents are marked as Applicant Exhibits A \nthrough E and are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 12, 2022.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j and denied the \nallegation in 1.k. In her FORM response, she amended her answer and admitted the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of facts. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old. She has cohabitated since 2010 and has a 10-year-old \nchild. She served on active duty in the military from 2007 to 2011, and received an \nhonorable discharge. She then served in the Army National Guard from 2012 to 2016, \nand was honorably discharged. Applicant attended technical school from 2011 to 2012 \nand earned an associate\u2019s degree. She attended community college from 2013 to 2015 \nand earned two additional associate\u2019s degrees. She was unemployed while she was a \nstudent. She has been employed by a federal contractor since February 2017. (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts. Nine of the delinquent debts are student \nloans totaling approximately $40,851 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.j) and the two remaining \ndebts are for a repossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.a - $8,538) and a collection account for \nunpaid rent and carpet cleaning services. (SOR \u00b6 1.k - $1,436). \nIn November 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator. She \ntold the investigator that she owed about $12,000 for her student loans as of June 2013. \nShe had failed to defer the student loans in a timely manner so they went into collection. \nShe said she subsequently deferred them as of June 2013, and will keep them in that \nstatus until she can manage monthly payments with a stable job. She was, however, \nconsidering an income-based repayment plan to start paying the loans soon. (Item 9) \nApplicant discussed with the investigator the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and explained the \ndebt was a car loan that she signed for her brother. At the time, she believed she was \ncosigning for the loan, but later found out the loan is solely in her name. Her brother was \nsupposed to make the monthly payments and failed to do so. She said the car was \nrepossessed in approximately 2015. At the time of her interview, she did not know the \ncurrent status of the account, but was going to contact the creditor. She said this debt \nwas beyond her control. (Item 9) \nApplicant told the investigator that she intended to pay all of her debts as soon as \npossible and would contact the creditors as soon as possible to resolve the accounts. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe said she had learned her lesson. She was not financially stable before the beginning \nof the year, but now has a stable job and better income. She has become financially \nresponsible and capable of meeting her financial obligations. (Item 9) \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2020 SCA, she disclosed her student loans and said they \nwere deferred and she would address them when she had a sufficient salary. (Item 4) \nIn June 2020, Applicant was interviewed again by a Government investigator. She \nconfirmed during the interview that she had previously told the investigator that she had \nplanned to setup a payment plan and attempted to resolve the delinquent debts previously \ndiscussed. She was asked if she had made payment arrangements and said she had not. \nShe initially said she did not have an explanation and then said she knew she should \nhave made it a priority, but chose not to. She told the investigator that the interview has \nopened her eyes as to the importance of resolving her debts and she now realizes she \nshould have followed through with the actions she previously told the investigator that she \nsaid she would do. She believed she owed around $12,000 for her delinquent student \nloans. She has never made a payment on her student loans. She received letters saying \nthe student loans were in default and would be sent to collection if payment was not made. \nApplicant told the investigator that she thought she had ten years after opening the \naccounts before she was required to make a payment. She believed that since the ten-\nyear period had not passed, she was not required to make a payment. She made no effort \nto contact the creditor or make payment arrangements. She said she had no other \nexplanation for why she did not pay her student loans. \nRegarding the repossessed vehicle, Applicant told the investigator that she \nconfronted her brother regarding the debt when she learned she was solely responsible \nfor it. She told her brother as long as he made the payments, he could keep the car. She \ntold the investigator that sometime in 2015 or 2016, she was notified the car was \nrepossessed. From 2015 to 2019, she received calls and letters from the creditor about \nthe remaining balance owed on the car. She ignored them until 2019 when she decided \nto address the delinquent debt. She setup a payment plan of $100 a month. (Item 9) \nDuring her June 2020 interview, Applicant was confronted with the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.k. She explained she had a dispute with the creditor. The debt was for her last month\u2019s\nrent on a residence she leased and an additional $500 for carpet cleaning. She had the\ncarpets cleaned, but did not retain the receipt to prove it and was charged the cleaning \nfee. At the time, she was unwilling to make the final payment on the amount she felt was \nwrongfully charged. This debt was placed for collection in December 2015. She did not\nexplain why she failed to pay her last month\u2019s rent. She told the investigator that she now\nagrees with the debt and will contact the creditor and setup a payment plan or settlement \nagreement. (Items 8, 9; AE E) \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed to the investigator that after she paid her bills she had \napproximately $128 remaining each month. She had about $2,000 in saving. She said \nshe lives within her means. She did not have a budget.

(Item 9) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her \nSCA, SOR answer, response to the FORM, statements to the Government investigator, \nand credit reports from May 2020, June 2021, and March 2022. (Items 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant stated she is a trustworthy and reliable person \nand has been given responsibilities at work and assisted fellow employees. She said that \nfinancial allegations have not had a negative impact on her work performance. (AE A) \nApplicant provided a document to show that she began making $100 payments in \nFebruary 2019 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It shows a current balance of $8,184 as of June \n2022. This debt is being resolved. (AE A, B) \nApplicant provided a receipt from June 2020 showing she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.k in June 2020, and it is resolved. (AE E) \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans, she stated that she was under a \n\u201cConsolidation of Rehabilitation\u201d program and the accounts were no longer in a default \nstatus. She did not provide evidence of the terms of this program, a payment plan, or that \nthe debts are no longer in a default status. She provided a document showing recent \npayments she has made towards the loans. The document shows she made her first \npayment on April 8, 2022 for $100, and three more payments in April of $50, $100, and \n$155. She then made three payments in May 2022 of $200, $150 and $150. In June 2022 \nshe made two payments of $50 and $100. The document also reflects two \u201ctreasury \noffsets\u201d from June 2019 for $886 and $111. These are presumably tax refunds that were \ninvoluntarily captured and applied to the delinquent balances. (AE D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans totaling $40,850. She also has two \naccounts that are in collection since about 2015. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant acknowledged her student loan debts during her 2017 background \ninterview and explained she had them deferred in 2013. She indicated she would contact \nthe creditor and begin to address the loans. In her 2020 interview, she claimed that she \nthought she had a ten-year grace period to pay the loans. Based on her past statements, \nthat assertion is not credible. She acknowledged she received letters notifying her that \nthe loans were in default and were being placed in a collection status. She had no \nexplanation for why she failed to address them after they were brought to her attention \nduring her 2017 interview. Regarding the repossessed vehicle, she believed this debt was \nbeyond her control. Even if she was unaware that the loan was solely in her name, she \nwas still ultimately responsible for it if her brother failed to make payments. She began \nreceiving collection notices in 2015 or 2016 and chose to ignore them until 2019. None of \nthese circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Applicant failed to act responsibly \nregarding her debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has been employed since 2017. She was interviewed in November 2017 \nand said she had learned her lesson. She acknowledged that she was not previously \nfinancially stable before, but now had a stable job and better income, and had become \nfinancially responsible and capable of meeting her financial obligations. She indicated \nher intent to contact creditors and make payment arrangements. In June 2020, she was \ninterviewed again and admitted she had not made any effort to contact the creditors and \naddress the delinquent debts. She told the investigator that her interview had opened her \neyes as to the importance of resolving her debts. She said she realized she should have \nfollowed through with the actions that she previously told the investigator she would do. \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not make payments towards her student \nloans until sometime after receiving the SOR in April 2022. She was aware of the \ncollection account for the repossessed car in about 2015 or 2016 and admitted to ignoring \nit until 2019 when she relented and began paying $100 a month. Her debt owed for her \nrent and cleaning dates back to 2015. She resolved it in 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing and recent. Despite being put on notice in \n2017 and again in 2020 during her interviews, and advising the investigator that she \nunderstood the importance of addressing her delinquent debts, she failed to make any \npayments on her student loans until April 2022. I find AG \u00b6 20(d) marginally applies to the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.k, but note that Applicant failed to resolve these debts until \nyears after they were due. Under the circumstances, I am unable to conclude that future \nfinancial issues are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. There is no evidence she has participated in financial \ncounseling. She provided insufficient evidence that her finances are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(c), and 20(e) do not apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has been steadily employed since 2017. She repeatedly promised to \naddress her student loans, but failed to do so until days after the SOR was issued. It has \ntaken her years to address the two other debts that were alleged in the SOR. Applicant \nhas failed to establish a reliable financial track record, and it is too early to conclude that \nshe will continue to make consistent payments on her student loans. Applicant failed to \nmeet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $24,000 in delinquent debt. Although he resolved one \nunalleged debt in September 2021, he provided no evidence of any payments or other \nresolution of the alleged delinquent debts. He also failed to provide any evidence that he \nhas contacted any of creditors of the SOR debts to establish payment arrangements. \nAccordingly, there is no evidence that has acted responsibly to resolve his financial \nissues. \nThe eight alleged debts remain outstanding and unpaid. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nHe has not provided any evidence of a good-faith effort to repay or resolve his delinquent \ndebts. For the forgoing reasons, Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant has not \nmet his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns or establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 39 years old. He has never been married and has no children. He received a high school diploma in 2003. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from February 2006 until May 2008, when he was honorably discharged. He has worked as an aircraft structural mechanic for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since May 2021. He previously held a secret clearance when he served in the Army. (Item 3; Item 4) The SOR alleges that Applicant has ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $23,310. He admitted all SOR allegations and provided no explanation or supporting documentation in his response to the SOR. (Items 2-4) In Applicant\u2019s June 2021 SCA, he disclosed some of the debts alleged in the SOR. He indicated his debts became delinquent after his previous job was \u201crestructured,\u201d and he lost pay; therefore, he could not afford to pay his credit card bills. Additionally, he wrote that he was taking a new job and could start paying his debts.

He has never been married and has no children. He \nreceived a high school diploma in 2003. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from \nFebruary 2006 until May 2008, when he was honorably discharged. He has worked as an \naircraft structural mechanic for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since May 2021. \nHe previously held a secret clearance when he served in the Army. (Item 3; Item 4) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has ten delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$23,310. He admitted all SOR allegations and provided no explanation or supporting \ndocumentation in his response to the SOR. (Items 2-4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2021 SCA, he disclosed some of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nHe indicated his debts became delinquent after his previous job was \u201crestructured,\u201d and \nhe lost pay; therefore, he could not afford to pay his credit card bills. Additionally, he wrote \nthat he was taking a new job and could start paying his debts. He did not provide details \nregarding the new job, but he was most likely referencing the DOD contractor position \nthat he started in May 2021, as he disclosed no periods of unemployment. (Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2021, and he \nprovided additional information regarding the \u201crestructuring\u201d of his previous job. He \nworked for his former employer from April 2013 to April 2021. In 2017 or 2018, his \nsupervisory position was eliminated, and he took a $5 an hour pay cut to continue working \nfor his employer. At the time of the interview, he stated that he had a plan to pay his debts \nby July 2024, but did not provide details. (Items 2-3) \nApplicant provided no documentation in his response to the SOR, nor a response \nto the FORM. There is no evidence in the record that he has resolved or is resolving any \nof the debts alleged in the SOR. (Items 2-4) \nThe $7,224 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a credit-card account that was opened \nin December 2016, and charged off in approximately August 2020. (Items 2-6) \nThe $3,089, $2,389, and $1,963 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d are \ncredit-card accounts that were opened with the same creditor in approximately 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s last payment toward each account was in 2018. They were placed for \ncollection and ultimately purchased by another creditor. (Items 2-6) \nThe $1,918 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is for a credit-card account that was opened \nin approximately August 2015. The account was charged off in June 2021. (Items 2-6) \nThe $1,866 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a credit-card account opened in 2016 at a \njewelry store. It became delinquent in approximately August 2018. (Items 2-6) \nThe $1,502 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is for a credit-card account that was placed \nfor collection.

During Applicant\u2019s interview, he told the investigator that \nhe turned in his phone to one of the company stores in 2017, after a merger with another \nprovider. At the time of the interview, he intended to dispute this debt. It appeared on his \nFebruary 2022 credit report without any reference to a dispute. (Items 2-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $23,000 in delinquent consumer debt. He incurred this debt, in \npart, due to a reduction in his hourly pay in 2017 or 2018. However, despite repeated \npromises to start repaying his debts, he provided no evidence of any payments or other \nresolution of his debts. He also failed to provide any evidence that he has contacted any \nof creditors of the SOR debts to establish payment arrangements. Accordingly, there is \nno evidence that he has acted responsibly to resolve his financial issues. \nThe ten alleged debts remain outstanding and unpaid. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nHe has not provided any evidence of a good-faith effort to repay or resolve his delinquent \ndebts. Although he admitted all of the allegations in his response to the SOR, he indicated \nhe had reasons to dispute several of the debts during his 2021 interview. However, he \nfailed to provide any documentation to substantiate the basis for his disputes. For the \nforgoing reasons, Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), (b), (d), or \n(e). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant has not \nmet his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns or establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-d and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-f. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 66-year-old operations supervisor employed by a federal contractor since September 2017. He attended a community college and a university between 1981 and 1985. He is divorced and has one adult child. His SCA reflects that he held a security clearance from 1983 to 1986. (FORM Item 3 at 35.) Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his state income tax return for tax year for 2017 and his federal and state income tax returns for 2018. In a security clearance interview, he stated that he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for tax year 2020. He admitted he owed an estimated total of $5,000 in federal taxes and $2,500 in state taxes. (FORM Item 4 at 2.) In response to DOHA interrogatories, he provided his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts which disclosed he failed to file, as required, his federal tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2020; and he is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $6,800 for tax year 2019. He noted in the interrogatories he had not made an Offer of Compromise or was in any payment arrangement to pay his delinquent taxes. (FORM Item 5 at 2.) His failures to file federal and state income tax returns are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. A March 2022 credit report reflects a last payment date of February 2022, reducing the",

The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant the PSI was being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case, and he \nwas entitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI; make any corrections, additions, \ndeletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear and accurate; object on the \nground that the report is unauthenticated. I conclude that Applicant waived any objections \nto the PSI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are \nnot expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps \nto protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12010810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. \n12, 2016).  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-d and \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-f. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is a 66-year-old operations supervisor employed by a federal contractor \nsince September 2017. He attended a community college and a university between 1981 \nand 1985. He is divorced and has one adult child. His SCA reflects that he held a security \nclearance from 1983 to 1986. (FORM Item 3 at 35.) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his state income tax return for \ntax year for 2017 and his federal and state income tax returns for 2018. In a security \nclearance interview, he stated that he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for \ntax year 2020. He admitted he owed an estimated total of $5,000 in federal taxes and \n$2,500 in state taxes. (FORM Item 4 at 2.) In response to DOHA interrogatories, he \nprovided his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts which disclosed he failed \nto file, as required, his federal tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2020; and he is indebted \nto the IRS in the amount of $6,800 for tax year 2019. He noted in the interrogatories he \nhad not made an Offer of Compromise or was in any payment arrangement to pay his \ndelinquent taxes. (FORM Item 5 at 2.) His failures to file federal and state income tax \nreturns are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. \nA March 2022 credit report reflects a last payment date of February 2022, reducing \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e from $1,334 to $949. (FORM Item 8 at 4.) Applicant told \nthe security investigator he disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,419), and had \nmade no effort to resolve it. (FORM Item 7 at 2.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nApplicant admits he failed to timely file, as required, his federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2017, 2018, and 2020 and his state income returns for tax years 2017, 2018, \n2019, and 2020 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c); that he owed $6,800 in federal taxes for the tax \nyear 2020, an approximate amount of $2,500 in state taxes for the tax year 2017 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d); and collection accounts in the approximate amounts of $1,334 and \n$1,419 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and 1.f). In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied these debts. \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, he indicated that neither debt had been paid and \nthat payment arrangements had been made for both. He provided no documentation of \npayment to support his statement. The 2022 credit report supports the statement that \npayments have been made on the one debt. The security concern under this guideline is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and his IRS account transcripts establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired\u201d).

He submitted no evidence of conditions \nlargely beyond his control. He has not engaged the IRS or the state regarding his tax \nproblems, and they remain unresolved. Notwithstanding his statements of intent to file his \ntax returns, he submitted no evidence that they have been filed. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is potentially applicable for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. There is no evidence \nthat either debt has been paid in full or that payment arrangements have been made. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2022 credit report shows payment activity for the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e. This mitigating condition is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Because \nhe has not provided documentation to support his assertion that payment arrangements \nhave been made, this mitigating condition is not established for SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor.

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 61 years old. She has been working full time as an accountant for a federal contractor since December 2019. She was awarded a master\u2019s degree in 2002. She married in 1981 and has two adult children. (Item 3 at 16, 15-16, and 36.) She first held a security clearance in 1983. (Item 7 at 6.) Applicant states the debts were primarily due to her and her husband\u2019s medical conditions. (Item 2 at 3.) She states she has been unable to get a higher paying job after leaving by mutual agreement a position she held for nine years with a government agency in 2015. (Item 3 at 26.) In 2018, after a year with a company she left her position following allegations of misconduct. (Item 7 at 6.) She notes her actions to reduce her expenses by use of local social services, driving an older vehicle, and living in a low rent area. (Item 2 at 3 and Item 6 at 11.) The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts that are established by two credit reports from March 2022 (Item 4), April 2020 (Item 5), and her answers to the July 2021 interrogatories (Item 6).

The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant in the FORM that the PSI was being \nprovided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in \nthis case; and that he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI; make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear and \naccurate; or object on the ground that the report is unauthenticated. I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objections to the PSI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. \n\u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to \ntake timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 12010810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-e and g-h. She denied \nSOR \u00b6 1 f. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. She has been working full time as an accountant for a \nfederal contractor since December 2019. She was awarded a master\u2019s degree in 2002. \nShe married in 1981 and has two adult children. (Item 3 at 16, 15-16, and 36.) She first \nheld a security clearance in 1983. (Item 7 at 6.) \nApplicant states the debts were primarily due to her and her husband\u2019s medical \nconditions. (Item 2 at 3.) She states she has been unable to get a higher paying job after \nleaving by mutual agreement a position she held for nine years with a government agency \nin 2015. (Item 3 at 26.) In 2018, after a year with a company she left her position following \nallegations of misconduct. (Item 7 at 6.) She notes her actions to reduce her expenses \nby use of local social services, driving an older vehicle, and living in a low rent area. (Item \n2 at 3 and Item 6 at 11.) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts that are established by two credit reports \nfrom March 2022 (Item 4), April 2020 (Item 5), and her answers to the July 2021 \ninterrogatories (Item 6). Applicant, with the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.f, admitted each \nallegation and stated she did not have the funds to pay these accounts. The evidence \nconcerning these debts is summarized below. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: phone account placed for collection of $1,920.

(Item 4 at 4, Item 5 \nat 6-7, and Item 6 at 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: education loan placed for collection of $91,066. (Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at \n7, and Item 6 at 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s student loans total about $312,733. (Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 6-7, and Item \n6 at 3-4.) Her student loans were in collection status before the COVID-19 pandemic. \n(Item 5 at 7.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d, and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d. \nApplicant accrued delinquent debts, including a home foreclosure, student loan \ndebts, and medical bills, during a period of unemployment or underemployment and \nhealth issues involving both her and husband. The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous \nand ongoing. She acknowledged in her Answer she has not resolved any of the debts. \nShe provided no mitigating documentation to support her assertion that SOR \u00b6 1.f had \nbeen resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant's medical debts occurred due to \ncircumstances beyond her control. She cites without further information or documentation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthe expenses associated with her and her spouse\u2019s ongoing health issues. Her claims of \nmedical expenses and underemployment are considered against the misconduct issues \nthat resulted in her leaving two of her jobs. She declares has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances by having no negative influences in her life, such as alcohol or drug abuse, \nand affirms her intent to resolve the financial issues. Even though her debts may have \noccurred due to circumstances beyond her control, she did not provide sufficient evidence \nthat she acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \nestablished. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and unresolved. Satisfaction of a \ndebt by foreclosure does not constitute a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to resolve it. She did not \nestablish that her financial problems are in the past and are unlikely to recur. She has not \nestablished a plan to resolve her financial problems. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). She did not establish that she has made a good-faith effort to \npay or resolve her debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by Guideline F. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, most of the SOR allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.f. through 1.i.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 49-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He was hired as a material analyst in August 2021, but as of November 2021, he had not yet commenced working for the company. He was previously employed in a variety of positions by other employers as a crane technician (June 2017 until March 2020), barista (April 2016 until June 2017), and quality assurance agent (July 2011 until July 2015). He was unemployed on two separate occasions, from July 2015 until April 2016, and from March 2020 until at least August 2021. He never served with the U.S. military. He attended ITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech) and received an associate\u2019s degree in 2011. He has never held a security clearance. He was married in 2009 and divorced in 2012. He has been cohabiting since 2020. He has two children, born in 2004 and 2008. The youngest child was subsequently adopted by her stepfather.

Applicant chose not to \nrespond to the FORM, for as of September 21, 2022, no response had been received. \nThe record closed on September 8, 2022.The case was assigned to me on October 19, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, most of the SOR \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.f. through 1.i.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and \ncomments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 49-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He was \nhired as a material analyst in August 2021, but as of November 2021, he had not yet \ncommenced working for the company. He was previously employed in a variety of \npositions by other employers as a crane technician (June 2017 until March 2020), barista \n(April 2016 until June 2017), and quality assurance agent (July 2011 until July 2015). He \nwas unemployed on two separate occasions, from July 2015 until April 2016, and from \nMarch 2020 until at least August 2021. He never served with the U.S. military. He \nattended ITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech) and received an associate\u2019s degree in 2011. \nHe has never held a security clearance. He was married in 2009 and divorced in 2012. \nHe has been cohabiting since 2020. He has two children, born in 2004 and 2008. The \nyoungest child was subsequently adopted by her stepfather. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated July 1, 2022); \nItem 3 (SF 86, dated August 24, 2021); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nNovember 8, 2021); and Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit \nReport, dated September 21, 2021). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having some financial issues associated \nwith delinquent accounts.

(Item 4 at 5-7) \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts, including four student loans \ntotaling approximately $36,156, and five other unpaid accounts totaling $13,822, for a \ngrand total of $49,978, as set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b. 1.d., and 1.f. refer to student loan accounts with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education with unpaid balances of $16,565; $11,705; $4,583; and $3,303 \nthat were placed for collection. (Item 2; Item 3 at 39-40; Item 4 at 5-7; Item 5 at 5) In 2020, \nApplicant stated that ITT Tech steered students towards subprime loans and made false \npromises that it would offer a bachelor\u2019s degree program, but it did not and instead went \nbankrupt. He would never have gone there for his associate\u2019s degree if he had known ITT \nTech\u2019s true intentions.

The account has not been \nresolved. \nITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech) \nITT Tech was considered a predatory for-profit college, and PEAKS, its holding \ncompany, would offer students tuition costs through private loans. A lawsuit was filed after \nITT Tech \u2013 the university that Applicant attended and generated extensive student loans \n\u2013 entered bankruptcy and closed its 137 campuses in 2016. After the school\u2019s closure, \nhundreds of thousands of students were still required to pay for their outstanding student \nloans. A 2018 lawsuit settlement forgave $600 million that 750,000 students owed to the \nschool. In June 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reached a \nsettlement with ITT Tech that discharged about $168 million in private student loans. In \nAugust 2019, an additional settlement was reached, including a judgment against ITT \nTech for $60 million and an injunction that prohibited ITT Tech from offering student loans \nin the future. In September 2020, the CFPB reached another settlement, requiring ITT \nTech to forgive $330 Million in outstanding student loan balances. In total, ITT Tech \nerased more than $500 million in private student loan debt. As noted by The Washington \nPost on September 15, 2020: \nForty-eight state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau have secured more than $330 million in private student-loan \nforgiveness for 35,000 former students of ITT Technical Institute. \nA judgment order entered Tuesday puts to rest a 2014 lawsuit accusing the \ndefunct for-profit chain of steering students into predatory loans. PEAKS \nTrust, a private loan program run by ITT Tech and affiliated with Deutsche \nBank entities, has agreed to forgo the collection of the outstanding \neducation debt from ITT Tech students. It will also ask credit-reporting \nagencies to delete references to those loans from the credit reports of \naffected borrowers. \nEligible borrowers will be notified by PEAKS or their loan servicer and need \nto do nothing to receive forgiveness.

Frosh (D) said \nin a statement Tuesday. \u201cPEAKS will be required by this settlement to \nprovide debt relief to Maryland students who we allege were misled while \nthey were working hard to further their education.\u201d \nITT Tech created two in-house student-loan programs as private lenders \nretreated from the market at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Banks \nstopped extending credit to students at for-profit colleges, because of their \nhistorically high default rates. \nITT Tech issued students \u201ctemporary credits\u201d to cover remaining tuition after \nfederal and private student loans were taken into account. Some former \nstudents said the credits were marketed as grants, while others said they \nwere told the credit would not have to be repaid until six months after \ngraduation. But when the temporary credit became due, ITT Tech allegedly \npressured students into accepting loans with double-digit interest rates from \nPEAKS. \nAccording to the complaint, students said they were pulled out of class or \nthreatened with expulsion if they refused to accept the loan terms. Many of \nthe former students lacked the means to continue their education and said \nthey felt there were no other options than to accept the loans. Eighty percent \nof the loans fell into default as students could not keep up with payments. \nEven as students began defaulting in great numbers around 2011, ITT Tech \ncontinued issuing the high-cost loans. The tactics landed the company\u2019s top \nbrass in the crosshairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The \nfederal agency settled fraud cases in 2018 against former ITT chief \nexecutive Kevin Modany and former chief financial officer Daniel Fitzpatrick \nfor allegedly deceiving investors about high rates of late payments and \ndefaults on student loans backed by the company. \nThe SEC said executives made secret payments on delinquent accounts to \ndelay defaults instead of disclosing the tens of millions of dollars in \nimpending losses to investors. Executives assured investors in conference \ncalls that the programs were performing well, while ITT\u2019s obligations to pay \nout on soured loans began to balloon, according to that complaint. \nBefore shutting down in 2016, ITT Tech was being investigated by more \nthan a dozen state attorneys general and two federal agencies for alleged \nfraud, deceptive marketing or steering students into predatory loans. That \nlegal morass led an accrediting body to threaten to end its relationship with \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe chain, which resulted in the Education Department curtailing ITT\u2019s \naccess to federal student aid. \nDays after closing and leaving 35,000 students and 8,000 employees in the \nlurch, the company filed for bankruptcy protection to liquidate its business. \n(washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/15/former-students-defunct-itt-tech-receive-\n330-million-private-student-loan-forgiveness/) \nA more recent update, referred to by Applicant, took place on August 16, 2022: \nToday, the U.S. Department of Education . . . announced that it will \ndischarge all remaining federal student loans that borrowers received to \nattend [ITT Tech] from January 1, 2005, through its closure in September \n2016. The decision, which follows Departmental findings based on \nextensive internal records, testimony from [ITT Tech] managers and \nrecruiters, and first-hand accounts from borrowers, will result in 208,000 \nborrowers receiving $3.9 billion in full loan discharges. This includes \nborrowers who have not yet applied for a borrower defense < Caution-\nhttps://studentaid.gov/borrower-defense/ > to repayment discharge. These \nborrowers will have the federal student loans they received to attend [ITT \nTech] discharged without any additional action on their part. \n\"It is time for student borrowers to stop shouldering the burden from [ITT \nTech]'s years of lies and false promises,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education \nMiguel Cardona. \"The evidence shows that for years, [ITT Tech]'s leaders \nintentionally misled students about the quality of their programs in order to \nprofit off federal student loan programs, with no regard for the hardship this \nwould cause. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to stand up for \nborrowers who've been cheated by their colleges, while working to \nstrengthen oversight and enforcement to protect today's students from \nsimilar deception and abuse.\" \nToday's action brings the total amount of loan relief approved by the Biden-\nHarris Administration to nearly $32 billion for 1.6 million borrowers. This \nincludes $13 billion related to institutions that took advantage of borrowers. \nIt represents the Department's continued commitment to providing debt \nrelief to eligible borrowers. \nToday's [ITT Tech] announcement builds on the Administration's previous \nactions related to [ITT Tech], which has resulted in the approval of $1.9 \nbillion in discharges for 130,000 students to date. This includes borrower \ndefense findings that [ITT Tech] engaged in widespread and pervasive \nmisrepresentations related to the ability of students to get a job or transfer \ncredits, and lying about the programmatic accreditation of [ITT Tech]'s \nassociate degree in nursing. Separately, the Department announced an \nexpanded window for borrowers who attended but did not graduate from \n[ITT Tech] to receive closed school discharges. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\"[ITT Tech] defrauded hundreds of thousands of students, as we identified \nwhen I was the director of the [CFPB],\" said Federal Student Aid Chief \nRichard Cordray. \"By delivering the loan relief students deserve, we are \ngiving them the opportunity to resume their educational journey without the \nunfair burden of student debt they are carrying from a dishonest institution.\" \nThe Department's findings around [ITT Tech] were assisted by significant \nand extensive work by attorneys general across the country, the [CFPB], \nand Veterans Education Success. The Department received important \nevidence from half the country's state offices of attorneys general, led by \nColorado and Oregon Attorneys General and supported by significant \nevidence from the Iowa and New Mexico Attorneys General. \nThe Department's findings are based on extensive evidence, including \ninternal [ITT Tech] policies and records; recruitment materials and \nbrochures; recordings of interactions between [ITT Tech]'s representatives \nand prospective students; testimony from former students, employees, and \nadministrators; investigative files and submissions from congressional \ninvestigators and state offices of attorneys general; and the tens of \nthousands of individual borrower defense applications submitted by former \n[ITT Tech] students. . . . \n\"The automatic loan cancellation announced today will provide life-changing \nrelief that has long been owed to former [ITT Tech] students,\" said Rohit \nChopra, director of the CFPB. \"Far too many Americans are still on the hook \nfor loans they acquired at colleges that profited from deceiving students, \nand the CFPB will continue to work with the Department of Education to \naddress predatory student loan debt, to protect students, and to hold \nwrongdoers accountable.\" \n(washingtonpost.com/education/2022/08/16/itt-tech-student-loan-forgiveness/) \nBased on all of the above, Applicant is no longer legally responsible for the student \nloans generated by ITT Tech and PEAKS, and it appears that all he has to do to obtain \nforgiveness for the loans is to complete and submit the appropriate application. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to describe with \nany specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. He did not report his net monthly \nincome, his monthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments (for even the \nmost insignificant of his delinquent debts such as the utility bill).

There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems \nare now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially than he had been. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe SOR alleged nine still-delinquent accounts, including four student loans \ntotaling approximately $36,156, and five other unpaid accounts totaling $13,822, for a \ngrand total of $49,978. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no \nevidence to indicate an unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of an ability to do so. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(e) apply. As noted above, Applicant has been through one \ndivorce in 2012 \u2013 well before the financial issues arose \u2013 and has been unemployed on \ntwo separate occasions (from July 2015 until April 2016, and from March 2020 until at \nleast August 2021). He was clearly the victim of ITT Tech \u2013 a predatory for-profit college \n\u2013 and its lending practices. The attorney generals of 48 states and the CFPB went after \nthat college and its holding company to extract justice for the defrauded students. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply because Applicant has failed, over a substantial period, to initiate \nany good-faith efforts to repay his overdue creditors despite promising to do so in several \ninstances, and falsely claiming in another instance that he was making payments. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).

Because of his failure to confirm payment of \neven his smallest delinquent account (the utility bill for $222), the overwhelming evidence \nleads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted \nresponsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts and by failing to make limited, if \nany, efforts of working with his creditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented \non such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making \nsuch efforts. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that \nsuch efforts were anticipated, but he took no verified efforts to do so. While his student \nloans may be on the cusp of being legally resolved because of the actions of the states \nand federal government, with regard to Applicant\u2019s remaining debts totaling $13,822, not \none delinquent debt has been resolved by him. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report indicates that two of his debts are in charged-off status. \nEventually the charged-off debts will be dropped from his credit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts \nhave dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCase No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most \nnegative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency \nor the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever \nis longer (Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c.

The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current \nfinancial information. Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.

Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He was hired \nas a material analyst in August 2021, but as of November 2021, he had not yet \ncommenced working for the company. He was previously employed in a variety of \npositions by other employers as a crane technician (June 2017 until March 2020), barista \n(April 2016 until June 2017), and quality assurance agent (July 2011 until July 2015). He \nwas unemployed on two separate occasions, from July 2015 until April 2016, and from \nMarch 2020 until at least August 2021. He attended ITT Tech and received an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2011. Forty-eight state attorneys general and the CFPB have secured hundreds \nof millions in private student-loan forgiveness for thousands of former students of ITT \nTech. Applicant was clearly one of the victims of ITT Tech \u2013 a predatory for-profit college \n\u2013 and its lending practices. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has five remaining debts totaling $13,822. In \nNovember 2021, he indicated to the OPM investigator that he was currently making $50 \npayments on one account until the account is paid, but In his Answer to the SOR, he \nseemed to reverse his former statement when he stated that he will rectify as soon as \npossible. Between the date he was interviewed by the OPM investigator in November \n2021, and the date his response to the FORM was expected in September 2022, he made \nno claimed or verifiable efforts to address ---\nany of the delinquent debts. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the non-\nstudent loan debts and the lengthy period of non-contact with his creditors is negative \nand disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph1. b.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior consultant in purchasing and quality since December 2019. He was previously employed by other employers as a buyer (November 2019 \u2013 December 2019), a part- time head physical therapist aide and purchasing specialist (September 2016 \u2013 September 2019), and part-time barista (June 2013 \u2013 September 2013). It is unclear if he is a high school graduate. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015 and received additional graduate credits for three months in 2018 and four months in 2019, but no other degree. He has never served in the U.S. military. He never held a security clearance. He has never been married.

On May 5, 2022, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services \n(CAS), previously known as the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order \n(Exec.

(Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 19, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. He received the \nFORM on September 12, 2022. His response was due on October 12, 2022. He timely \nresponded to the FORM and submitted one document that was marked and admitted \nwithout objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to me on December \n2, 2022. The record closed on October 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nSOR allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.). His admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior consultant in purchasing and quality since December 2019. He was previously \nemployed by other employers as a buyer (November 2019 \u2013 December 2019), a part-\ntime head physical therapist aide and purchasing specialist (September 2016 \u2013 \nSeptember 2019), and part-time barista (June 2013 \u2013 September 2013). It is unclear if he \nis a high school graduate. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015 and received \nadditional graduate credits for three months in 2018 and four months in 2019, but no other \ndegree. He has never served in the U.S. military. He never held a security clearance. He \nhas never been married. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated June 3, 2022; \nItem 3 (SF 86, dated July 28, 2021); Item 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax \nCredit Report, dated August 19, 2021); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 27, \n2022); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview (ESI), dated August 30, 2021); and AE A \n(Response to the FORM, dated October 3, 2022). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having some financial issues associated \nwith his delinquent student loans estimated to be approximately $142,000.

During that interview, he disclosed and described the delinquent \nstudent loans that were co-signed by his father (now deceased). There were six loans \ngenerated through government sources and one large loan from a credit union. The loans \nwere deferred until September 2016 while he was a student, and his payments were to \ncommence at that time. However, claiming financial hardship, he obtained an economic \nhardship waiver and the loans were again deferred until August 2018. Payments \nestimated to be \u201ca few hundred dollars\u201d per month were to commence at that time. \nBecause he had insufficient wages to pay both his normal bills and his student loans, he \nfocused on his bills, essentially ignoring his student loans. He made no effort to address \nhis student loans from August 2018 until March 2021. Because of his failure make any \ntimely payments, after a period of about 90 days, Applicant\u2019s six student loans were \nreturned by the loan servicer and assigned to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), \neventually designated as defaulted loans, and placed for collection. The one remaining \nstudent loan was charged off by the lender. He claimed that since he now had a good full-\ntime job, he would start paying his delinquent loans. (Item 6 at 3-5) The investigator gave \nhim the opportunity to provide documentation regarding the student loans both during the \ninterview and after the interview, but Applicant failed to do so. (Item 6 at 5) \nIn his June 2022 Answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged having made \nattempts to create a payment plan for the six defaulted student loans by contacting the \nDOE. (Item 2) He submitted a letter from the DOE, dated May 20, 2022, and the \ninformation in the letter set forth the required steps to rehabilitate his student loans. That \nletter also referred to the CARES Act. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) \nAct \u2013 the original coronavirus emergency relief bill \u2013 temporarily paused payments and \ninvoluntary collections on most federally held student loans through September 30, 2020. \nThe pause was subsequently extended until December 31, 2022. (DOE Press Release, \nAugust 24, 2022) On April 6, 2022, the DOE announced an initiative called \u201cFresh Start\u201d \nto help eligible borrowers whose loans were in default. Among the benefits of the new \nprogram were that the CARES relief pause would continue, collection efforts would cease, \nand wages would not be garnished. \nIn Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, he contended that since May 2021 he has \nmade repeated attempts with the DOE to rehabilitate his six defaulted student loans and \nexchanged documentation including his income tax information. He claimed that in \nOctober 2022, he was told that he was eligible to start repayments through either a \nconsolidation or a repayment plan. He has made no efforts to address the one remaining \nstudent loan with the credit union because the loan has been charged off. (AE A) He failed \nto submit any documentation to verify any of the claims he has made regarding the efforts \nhe purportedly made with the DOE. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant expanded on the factors that attributed to his inability to timely pay his \nstudent loans. Initially, it was because he was not making enough money to pay back the \nloans because his only career option was in physical therapy, and he was only making \n$17,000 a year. Midway through preparing to become a physical therapist, he realized \nthat the field was no longer viable for him and he made a career change. (AE A) \nThe SOR alleged six still-delinquent student-loan accounts with the DOE totaling \napproximately $48,582, plus the one credit union charged off student loan totaling \n$101,988, for a combined total of approximately $150,570 as set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a student-loan account with an unpaid balance of $7,036 that \nwas placed for collection. (Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 4) As of the date the SOR was issued, \nthe account remained delinquent. Although Applicant apparently has taken some recent \nunverified steps to rehabilitate it, the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a student-loan account with an unpaid balance of $9,640 that \nwas placed for collection.

Although Applicant apparently has taken some recent \nunverified steps to rehabilitate it, the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to a student-loan account with an unpaid balance of $3,740 that \nwas placed for collection.

He did not submit \na budget reflecting a monthly income, total monthly expenses, or any funds available for \nsavings or spending. There is no evidence of financial counseling. There is a paucity of \nevidence to indicate if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged six still-delinquent student-loan accounts with the DOE totaling \napproximately $48,582, plus the one credit union charged off student loan totaling \n$101,988, for a combined total of approximately $150,570 On its face, without any \nbackground information, Applicant\u2019s history of still-delinquent debts appears to present \neither an inability to satisfy debts, or a history of not meeting financial obligations. He \nacknowledged that he chose to pay his normal bills to the exclusion of his student loans, \neven after December 2019, when he obtained his current position. His apparent \ndisinterest or inability in focusing on his student-loan accounts between August 2018 and \nMarch 2021, when the CARES Act temporarily paused payments and involuntary \ncollections on most federally held student loans, supports a conclusion that he also had \na reluctance or unwillingness to satisfy those debts regardless of the ability to do so. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nNone of the conditions apply. Six of Applicant\u2019s student loans were assigned to the \nDOE, eventually designated as defaulted loans, and placed for collection. One student \nloan with the credit union \u2013 for over $100,000 \u2013 was charged off. The loans were deferred \nuntil September 2016 while he was a student, and his payments were to commence at \nthat time. However, claiming financial hardship, he obtained an economic hardship waiver \nand the loans were again deferred until August 2018. Payments estimated to be \u201ca few \nhundred dollars\u201d per month were to commence at that time. Because he had insufficient \nwages to pay both his normal bills and his student loans, he focused on his bills, \nessentially ignoring his student loans. He made no effort to address his student loans \nfrom August 2018 until March 2021. He obtained his current position in December 2019, \nbut made no efforts to address his delinquent student loans. He claimed to the OPM \ninvestigator in August 2021 that since he now had a good full-time job, he would start \npaying his delinquent loans, but he had made no such efforts between December 2019 \nand some unverified date in 2021. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it is clear that Applicant intentionally ignored his delinquent \nstudent-loan accounts for a substantial multi-year period, even after receiving deferments. \nThe overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems were not \nunder control, and that the initial unverifiable efforts to fix his problem did not start until \nsometime in 2021. He acted irresponsibly by failing to address his delinquent student-\nloan accounts and by failing to make limited, if any, verified efforts of working with his loan \nservicers or DOE creditors before he submitted his SF 86. The Appeal Board has \npreviously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to offer any evidence that he began making such efforts \nuntil he submitted his SF 86. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that no \nsuch efforts regarding the DOE loans were made until 2021, and no efforts have still been \nmade with the credit union that charged off $101,988. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling. Despite his very recent \npurported efforts to start rehabilitating six of his seven delinquent student-loan accounts \nafter several years of inaction, Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nHe is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior \nconsultant in purchasing and quality since December 2019. He was previously employed \nby other employers as a buyer, a part-time head physical therapist aide and purchasing \nspecialist, and part-time barista. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015 and received \nadditional graduate credits for three months in 2018 and four months in 2019, but no other \ndegree. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has six still-delinquent student-loan accounts with \nthe DOE totaling approximately $48,582, plus the one credit union charged off student \nloan totaling $101,988, for a combined total of approximately $150,570. He acknowledged \nthat he chose to pay his normal bills to the exclusion of his student loans, even after \nDecember 2019, when he obtained his current position. He claimed to the OPM \ninvestigator in August 2021 that since he now had a good full-time job, he would start \npaying his delinquent loans, but he had made no such efforts between December 2019 \nand some unverified date in 2021. His apparent disinterest or inability in focusing on his \nstudent-loan accounts between August 2018 and March 2021, when the CARES Act \ntemporarily paused payments and involuntary collections on most federally held student \nloans, supports a conclusion that he also had a reluctance or unwillingness to satisfy \nthose debts regardless of the ability to do so. In light of his disinterest to take any such \nactions until he submitted his SF 86, there are lingering questions if Applicant is currently \nin a better position financially than he had been, as well as continuing doubt about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of nearly zero claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the \nseven delinquent student-loan debts and the lengthy period of non-contact with his \ncreditors, is negative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial \nquestions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 53-year-old lifecycle management engineer, employed by a defense contractor since 2001. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005 and a master\u2019s degree in 2006. He married in 2010 and has three children. He has held clearance eligibility since at least 2001. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on Federal taxes and other debts totaling about $45,315. His debts include Federal taxes owed for tax years 2018 and 2019 totaling over $25,000. The remaining 15 alleged debts are charged- off and collection accounts. Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations, except a $64 insurance company collection account, which he denied as his debt but said he will nonetheless pay it by December 2024. His admissions and the Government\u2019s documentary evidence are sufficient to support the SOR allegations. Applicant explained that in January 2018, his spouse started a job that ended within six weeks, resulting in a loss of 35% of their household income. In addition, the following circumstances caused a financial strain on Applicant and his family: caring for their pregnant daughter-in-law and child in May 2019, while their son was in military basic training; his spouse\u2019s surgery; and full-time care for their infirmed parents. As a result, his wife lost 15 months of income that would have contributed to the family\u2019s finances.

He received the \nFORM on July 29, 2022. He submitted material in response to the FORM that was \ncollectively marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which I admitted without objection. He \ndid not object to the Government\u2019s exhibits. The case was assigned to me on October 3, \n2022. Government Exhibits (GE) 2-5 are admitted into evidence without objection. The \nFORM identified the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR as GE 1; however, they \nare already part of the record. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old lifecycle management engineer, employed by a defense \ncontractor since 2001. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005 and a master\u2019s degree in \n2006. He married in 2010 and has three children. He has held clearance eligibility since \nat least 2001. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on Federal taxes \nand other debts totaling about $45,315. His debts include Federal taxes owed for tax \nyears 2018 and 2019 totaling over $25,000. The remaining 15 alleged debts are charged-\noff and collection accounts. Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations, \nexcept a $64 insurance company collection account, which he denied as his debt but said \nhe will nonetheless pay it by December 2024. His admissions and the Government\u2019s \ndocumentary evidence are sufficient to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant explained that in January 2018, his spouse started a job that ended \nwithin six weeks, resulting in a loss of 35% of their household income. In addition, the \nfollowing circumstances caused a financial strain on Applicant and his family: caring for \ntheir pregnant daughter-in-law and child in May 2019, while their son was in military basic \ntraining; his spouse\u2019s surgery; and full-time care for their infirmed parents. As a result, his \nwife lost 15 months of income that would have contributed to the family\u2019s finances. He \nstated that his spouse started a new job in August 2020, and they have paid about \n$37,724 in non-SOR debts directly or through garnishments, and have about $43,279 in \ndebts left. He said that about 25% of his debts are being resolved through garnishments \nthat began in January 2021. Applicant expects most of the SOR debts to be resolved by \n2023 or 2024. (Ans.) \nApplicant provided documentary evidence to show that he is in a repayment \narrangement with the IRS for his delinquent Federal taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). He \nsubmitted a page from an undated IRS online payment agreement that shows he is \nscheduled to pay $750 per month on an installment plan; however, he did not show the \nterms of the agreement, when payments would begin, or whether any payments have \nbeen made to date. He also provided evidence that he has resolved SOR \u00b6 1.c, an \nappliance company account, via garnishment, totaling $5,763. No other documentary \nevidence was provided of his efforts to investigate, pay, dispute, or otherwise resolve the \nremaining SOR debts, or of his current financial status.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant is indebted on Federal taxes and other delinquent debts, totaling over \n$45.000. The documentary evidence in the record and Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nsufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are fully established. Applicant has \naccumulated delinquent debts, largely due to circumstances outside of his control. \nHowever, he has not shown sufficient evidence to conclude that most of the debts are in \nthe process of or have been resolved. The Appeal Board has ruled that even if Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \ncontrol, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. No such \nefforts were substantiated in this case for most of the SOR debts. Mere promises to pay \ndebts in the future, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s current online payment agreement with the IRS, his tax debts \nremain outstanding. Although Applicant deserves credit for the steps he has made thus \nfar to satisfy his delinquent tax debts, there is not yet a track record of payments to \nconclude that he is along the path of mitigation of his delinquent taxes. Applicant is \ncredited with resolving past delinquencies not alleged in the SOR, but he has not shown \npersuasive evidence of efforts to resolve the remaining SOR debts, nor has he shown \nevidence of his overall financial responsibility. However, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is resolved. \nThere is insufficient evidence to determine that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will \nbe resolved within a reasonable period and that he can obtain and maintain a measure \nof financial responsibility. No evidence of formal financial counseling was submitted. His \nfinancial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. No mitigation credit is applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered his spouse\u2019s \nemployment history and impediments to her contributions to the family\u2019s finances, her \nmedical issues, and their required periods of financial and physical support for family \nmembers. Because he requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had \nno opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor or to question \nhim about the circumstances that led to his debts or any action he may have taken to \naddress them. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, including exceptions available under Appendix C of SEAD \n4. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \ndelinquencies. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1d-1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The advertisement was posted and monitored by an undercover detective in the local police department. Applicant exchanged several text massages with the undercover detective, and requested a sex act in exchange for money. He went to the designated meet-up location, which was a local motel, and requested the room number by text message. He was stopped by police leaving the motel parking lot.

His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He was married in 2000, and divorced in 2018. He has \ntwo minor children with his former wife. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2007. He has worked for a large defense contractor since 2001, and \nis employed as a support planning and management engineer. He has held a security \nclearance since 2001. (Items 3, 4) \nIn March 2019, Applicant was arrested as part of a police sting operation, for \npatronizing a prostitute. He responded to an advertisement on a website known for \nprostitution. The advertisement was posted and monitored by an undercover detective in \nthe local police department. Applicant exchanged several text massages with the \nundercover detective, and requested a sex act in exchange for money. He went to the \ndesignated meet-up location, which was a local motel, and requested the room number \nby text message. He was stopped by police leaving the motel parking lot. During the stop, \nthe detective confirmed that Applicant\u2019s phone was used to respond to the advertisement \nand send the text messages. After being charged with patronizing a prostitute, he entered \na plea deal and the charge was reduced to criminal trespass. He pled guilty and received \nan 18-month deferred sentence, a fine, a requirement to attend \u201cJohn school,\u201d and take \nan HIV test. He was also ordered to stay away from the motel where he was arrested and \nany online websites hosting personal ads for dating services. (Item 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant was also stopped in 2005 by police for picking up two prostitutes on the \nstreet, one who was a minor at the time. The record states that after the stop, he told the \nofficer that he believed the women were prostitutes. He was not arrested, but the officer \ngave him a verbal warning. (Item 6, 7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he \nreported that he had patronized prostitutes in 2015 during a period of turbulence in his \nmarriage. He initially described these encounters as affairs with \u201cmany women,\u201d but later \nadmitted to the investigator that these women were prostitutes. His wife discovered his \nactivities because the money he was spending appeared suspicious on their financial \nstatements. This circumstance resulted in her filing for divorce. (Item 5). \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2021 background interview, he admitted that he has a \nsex addiction. He also stated that he would not engage in this behavior again, and claimed \nthat he was controlling his urges. He reported that he was seeking anonymous group \ncounseling, through an online virtual service. (Item 5) \nIn his Response, Applicant stated that he was diagnosed with sex addiction in \n2015, and had participated in several years of counseling. He also reported that, in 2015, \nhe began attending weekly meetings of Sex Addicts Anonymous, which is a 12-step \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprogram. He attended those meetings in person until 2020, and then virtually because of \nthe pandemic. It is unknown whether he is still attending these meetings. He stated that \nafter his 2019 arrest, he sought comprehensive addiction treatment for three weeks at an \ninpatient facility. (Response) \nApplicant submitted a letter from his former counselor that states that he attended \ntherapy with her from 2015 through 2020, and that he sought treatment for sexual \ncompulsivity issues, and struggled with depression and anxiety. He also submitted a letter \nfrom a rehabilitation center that states in March and April 2019, he received a 21-day \ninpatient residential clinical and therapeutic treatment. It does not state for what condition \nhe was treated. No assessment, prognosis, or further information was provided by either \ntreatment provider. (AE A, B) \nThe SOR alleges: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant was arrested in March 2019 and charged with patronizing a \nprostitute. He admitted the allegation. (Item 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant engaged in solicitation of prostitutes in about 2015 and was \nquestioned by police. He admitted engaging in solicitation in 2015, but denied being \nquestioned by police in 2015. The Government submitted evidence showing that he was \nquestioned by police in 2005, not 2015. (Item 2, 5, 6, 7)  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: Applicant failed to report his charge for patronizing a prostitute to his \nemployer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO), as required by the National Industrial Security \nProgram Operating Manual (NISPOM). He denied the allegation and claims that his \nfailure to report was a misunderstanding. He explained that he thought that he did not \nhave to report the incident until he filled out his next SCA, which was submitted about a \nyear later. He claimed that he did not intend to hide the arrest. He discrepantly also \nasserted that he asked the FSO for a form to report the adverse information, and was told \nthere was not one. He stated that he did not understand the reporting process in 2019, \nand was unaware of any reporting issue until he received the SOR in May 2022. He \nadmitted that he told a former co-worker about his arrest, but not his manager or then \ncurrent co-workers. (Item 2, 5; Response)  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: Cross-alleged the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under Guideline E \n(personal conduct). Applicant denied the allegations on the basis that it is redundant.\n(Item 2)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a: Cross-alleged the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under Guideline J \n(criminal conduct). Applicant admitted the allegation. (Item 2) \nApplicant stated that he has had a security clearance for 20 years, and has always \nsafeguarded classified information. He admitted making mistakes of personal conduct, \nand that he continued to take steps so that he does not repeat those mistakes. \n(Response) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; and  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions, the court and police records, \nand his background interviews. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(b), and 13(c) apply. \nIn SOR \u00b6 1.b, the record shows that Applicant solicited prostitutes in 2015, but the \nGovernment did not establish the second part of the allegation - that he was questioned \nby police in 2015. The record shows that he was questioned by police in 2005. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(a), 13(b), and 13(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the \nbehavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. The record shows that Applicant was patronizing \nprostitutes from at least 2005 - 2019. While he has had therapy, he did not submit \nsufficient evidence about his current condition or prognosis. I am unable to find that it \noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and that it does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 14(c) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s solicitation and patronizing of prostitutes \nserves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, and duress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s solicitation of prostitutes, both online and \non the street is not private or discreet. His behaviors have come to the attention of his \nformer wife and the police at least two times, the most recent time resulting in his arrest. \nAG \u00b6 14(e) does not apply. While Applicant has engaged in therapy, a rehab \nprogram, and a 12-step program, he did not provide sufficient evidence showing that he \nsuccessfully completed an appropriate program of treatment for his sexual addiction, or \nis currently enrolled in one. He did not provide sufficient evidence showing that he has \ndemonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following is potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that \ncountry; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal there, \nis illegal in the United States. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is found for Applicant. The NISPOM (DoD 5220.22-M) provides policy \nand procedures for cleared contactor companies to handle and protect classified \ninformation. It was not written to apply to individual persons. While Applicant admitted \nthat he did not inform his manager or co-workers about his arrest, the Government did \nnot provide sufficient evidence showing that he violated his employer\u2019s reporting and \nsecurity policies and procedures. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleged the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which were established \nunder Guideline D. AG \u00b6 16(e) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. The offense was not minor. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior \nwas criminal in nature, and he was arrested for it in 2019. There is insufficient evidence \nto find there is mitigation by the passage of time, the behavior is infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) partially applies. While the record shows that Applicant has had \ncounseling to address his sexual compulsivity issues, he did not provide sufficient \nevidence to find that he has taken the necessary steps to alleviate stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to his untrustworthy, unreliable, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ninappropriate behavior. He did not provide sufficient evidence to find that such behavior \nis unlikely to recur. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleged the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which were established \nunder Guideline D. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior was criminal in nature, and \nhe was arrested for it in 2019. There is insufficient evidence to find there is mitigation by \nthe passage of time, that it is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply.

The Government had no \nobjections. All evidence was admitted. The case was assigned to me on September 29, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, but disputed certain facts alleged in \neach allegation. I have incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. He has been married three times and to his current wife \nsince 2004. He has five adult children and two adult stepchildren. He served in the Army \nNational Guard from 1982 to 1987 and received an honorable discharge. He has been an \nowner-operator truck driver since 2005 and works for federal contractors. \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts. They are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR, statements to a government investigator, \nstatements in his response to the FORM, and credit reports from November 2018, August \n2019, March 2021 and April 2022. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; AE E) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2019. He told the \ninvestigator he was unaware of the consumer account in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($19,691) and did \nnot know when it became delinquent, but acknowledged he did not earn enough money \nat the time to pay the monthly payments. He acknowledged receiving a collection notice \nin the mail and had set up a payment plan with the creditor in March 2019 and was making \nmonthly payments of $1,512. He anticipated the account would be resolved in January \n2020. He told the investigator he was complying with the payment plan. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the account in \u00b6 1.a, but disputed \nthe balance owed. He said the balance owed was $13,627, and believed he had paid it, \nso he disputed it on his credit report. He said he contacted the original creditor and they \ncould not find his account. In his response to the FORM, Applicant explained that he had \nlearned that his monthly payments were being paid to the collection company and at some \npoint that company was no longer holding the debt and a new collection company held it. \nApplicant was unaware that this transfer of collection companies happened, and he \nbelieved he had paid the debt. He then contacted the original creditor who confirmed that \nhis monthly payments were applied to the original balance and his current balance was \n$13,627. Applicant provided a June 2022 letter from the new collection company agreeing \nto settle the account for $7,000. He also provided confirmation that he paid the settlement \namount and the debt is resolved.

Applicant acknowledged to \nthe government investigator that he owed the debt, but could not recall when it became \ndelinquent, but it was because he was not earning enough money to pay it. He said he \nhad received a collection notice in the mail. He said he had paid the debt in May 2019. In \nhis response to the FORM, he stated that he had disputed the debt on his credit report. \nHe contacted the collection company that held the debt and was advised the debt was \npaid. He provided a June 2022 letter confirming the debt was settled for less than the full \namount and there is a zero balance owed. The debt is resolved. (Items 2, 4, AE H) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($10,652) is for medical services that were in collection. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2021 and April 2022 credit reports show the account as delinquent \nsince May 2018 with no payments made. In his SOR answer, he stated that he was \nunaware he owed the medical debt and believed his insurance had covered his medical \nexpenses. He said when he learned of the debt from his SOR, he paid it immediately. \nApplicant provided documentary proof that he paid it on May 10, 2022, the date of the \nSOR. The debt is resolved. (Items 2, 7, 8; AE D) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he is living within his means \nand is not overextended. His wife is paying closer attention to their finances, and he will \nensure they never get behind in their payments or financial obligations again. He has \nlearned that if he disagrees with a debt, he will contact the creditor and find out its status. \nThe three delinquent debts were an aberration, and he and his wife will be diligent in \nreviewing their credit reports to make sure it does not happen again. Applicant has \nrecently paid off the mortgage on his home, four years before the loan matured, and he \nhas a significant sum in savings. (Item 2; AE E, J, K) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had three delinquent debts that he was unable to pay. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a period of underemployment. The \nconcern is that Applicant was not monitoring his finances and was unaware of his debts, \nwhich he should have been. He was unaware that the debts alleged were in collection. \nWhen confronted with them by the government investigator he made payment \narrangements on one debt. He was making the payments, but was unaware the collection \ncompany had transferred the debt. When he contacted the original creditor and learned \nthere was still an outstanding balance, he settled the debt. When he learned of the other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntwo debts he resolved them. Applicant\u2019s underemployment was beyond his control. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly, which he did \nwhen he became aware of the debts and paid them. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling. There is \nevidence that Applicant and his wife are paying closer attention to their finances and are \nbeing diligent in making sure they do not incur new delinquent debts. He is financially \nsolvent and able to meet all of his expenses. I find that his financial problems happened \nunder unique circumstances and are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. The evidence supports that his financial \nissues are under control. I find AG \u00b6 20(a) applies and AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

The hearing was convened as scheduled via \nTEAMS video conference on September 28, 2022. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and offered nine exhibits, which he had attached to his Answer. \nI marked the exhibits as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, and admitted them without \nobjection.

He graduated from \nhigh school and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He was also awarded a certificate in 2004. \nHe enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1981 and served until 1986, when he was honorably \ndischarged. He then enlisted in the Navy Reserve and served until 2013. At the time of \nhis discharge from the Reserve, he held the rank of Command Master Chief (E-9).

(Tr. at 25-28, 31-33; GE 1 \nat 8, 12-19, 21-23.) \nParagraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore \npotentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Applicant admitted three of the five allegations in the SOR. He also \nsubmitted additional information to support the granting of national security eligibility. \nThe Government alleged that Applicant had failed to timely file his Federal tax \nreturns for tax years (TYs) 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (SOR subparagraph 1.a) \nas well as TY 2017. (SOR subparagraph 1.b) Subparagraph 1.c alleged that Applicant \nfailed to timely file his state tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2020. The SOR further \nalleged past-due state income taxes of $5,821 (SOR subparagraph 1.d) and past-due \ncounty property taxes of $204 for TY 2019. (SOR subparagraph 1.e). In the Answer, \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR 1.a and 1.c and admitted the other allegations. \nHe provided additional information with respect to each SOR subparagraph: \n1.a Failure to timely file Federal tax returns for TYs 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, and \n2020. Despite Applicant\u2019s denial, the record established that this allegation was accurate. \nApplicant filed his Federal tax returns for TYs 2019 and 2020 in or about May 2022, one \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor two years late. He advised that his tax preparer was in the process of preparing Federal \ntax returns for the three earlier years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 30-54; AE J and AE K.) \nPrior to the hearing Applicant provided IRS Account Transcripts for TYs 2019 and \n2020. These transcripts reflect that Applicant paid in 2022 substantial sums due with each \nreturn, specifically $19,239 for 2019 and $17,214 for TY 2020. They also reflect additional \ntaxes and penalties owed in the amounts of $3,693 and $1,213 for TYs 2019 and 2020, \nrespectively. Applicant planned to pay the amounts due on or before October 2, 2022. \nThe tax deficiencies were due to under withholding on his and his wife\u2019s combined annual \nincome of about $300,000. Applicant did not file his TYs 2019 and 2020 returns on time \nbecause he did not have a tax preparer that he trusted until after the TY 2020 return was \ndue in 2021. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 30-54; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE J, and AE K.) \nApplicant has been delayed filing his Federal returns for TY 2018 because he \nneeds a specific tax document to prepare his tax return. He wants his recently hired tax \npreparer to complete the return with an estimate of the missing information. He expects \nto have the TY 2018 Federal return filed shortly after the hearing date. The IRS had \nassessed taxes for that tax year in the amount of $20,469, and he paid the assessment. \nHe had purchased tax preparation software for TYs 2014, 2016, and 2018, but he did not \nfeel confident that he was properly using it. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 30-54, 58; AE C.) \nApplicant filed for an extension in 2017 for TY 2016 and paid an estimated tax due \nof $19,319. He failed to file his return thereafter because he had no tax professional he \ncould trust. His current tax professional has not yet had the time to prepare the TY 2016 \nFederal return for Applicant. He trusts that his tax professional will eventually file the \nreturn for TY 2016. Applicant admitted that he has been lax about dealing with his tax \nfiling responsibilities. He expects the TY 2016 return to be filed before the end of 2022. \n(Answer at 1; Tr. at 55-59; AE B.) \nApplicant used commercial tax preparation software to file his TY 2015 tax return. \nThe return was timely filed. TY 2014 was the first year when Applicant failed to file his \nfederal tax return. The tax professional who had prepared his prior returns had retired, \nand Applicant did not identify a new person to help him. His new tax professional will \nprepare this return when he has the time available to do so. Applicant has a goal to file \nthe return by yearend 2022. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 59-65; AE A.) \n1.b Failure to timely file Federal tax return for TY 2017. Applicant wrote in the \nAnswer that he will file his TY 2017 Federal tax return once his tax preparer has \ncompleted it. As of the hearing date, the return had not been filed. Applicant attached to \nthe Answer an Account Transcript from the IRS for TY 2017. It reflects that the IRS \nprepared a substitute return on April 27, 2020, for this year and assessed additional taxes \nin the amount of $30,929. Applicant made a payment on February 8, 2021, in the amount \nof $24,964. He intends to have his tax professional file his own tax return for TY 2017. \n(Answer at 1; Tr. at 65-70; AE F.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.c Failure to timely file state tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2020.  In the Answer \nApplicant wrote that he has filed his State A tax returns for TYs 2019 and 2020. He also \nwrote that the returns for the other years will be filed once his tax preparer has completed \nthe returns. For TY 2019 he owed $613, and he received a small refund for TY 2020.  The \nstate tax authority reassessed his taxes for TY 2019 and determined that Applicant owed \nan additional $4,049. Applicant intends to file his other state tax returns when he files his \nFederal tax returns for the TYs 2014 and 2016 through 2018 and will pay any taxes he is \nassessed for those years. He filed his TY 2015 state tax return when he filed his Federal \nreturn for that year using tax preparation software. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 70-76.) \n1.d Delinquent state tax debt in the approximate amount of $5,821. In the Answer \nApplicant wrote that this tax debt arose because he filed separately from his wife in 2019. \nHe has refiled an amended joint return with his wife. When his return was filed, he paid \ntaxes due per the amended return of $613. Shortly before the hearing he paid additional \nstate tax in the amount of $4,048, which is the amount he calculated after the state makes \nan adjustment of over $6,000. The state has not yet determined if Applicant\u2019s recent \npayment satisfies his tax obligations. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 76-79.)  \n1.e Delinquent county property tax debt for TY 2019 in the approximate amount of \n$204. Applicant did not receive the county tax bill for one year on a timeshare he owns. \nHe became aware of the tax delinquency when he received the SOR and paid this debt \non June 9, 2022. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 79-81; GE 4; AE G.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national\nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.\nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under\nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   \n \n \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns, as required, for TYs \n2014 and 2016 through 2020. He also failed to timely file his state income tax returns for \nthe same tax years. The SOR does not allege that Applicant has any outstanding Federal \nor state income tax obligations other than a state tax delinquency of $5,821. Applicant \ntestified without any documentary evidence that he has resolved that tax debt with the \npossible exception of some additional interest or penalties. Applicant also had a \ndelinquent property tax debt. These facts establish the foregoing disqualifying condition \nand shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant had been delinquent in filing his Federal and state tax returns for most \nyears since TY 2014 due to his dilatory conduct. He blames the retirement of his former \naccountant and his lack of confidence that he was correctly using self-preparer software. \nHe has no persuasive excuse for not hiring a new tax preparer in 2014 to prepare his tax \nreturns or for not seeking advice on how to use the commercial tax preparation software \nproperly. As of the date the record closed, he had only filed his tax returns for the two \nmost recent years. He claims that he only has confidence in the tax preparer he has \nrecently hired.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nI have weighed Applicant\u2019s 33 years of service in the Navy with two deployments and his \nachievement of retiring from the Navy Reserve as a Command Master Chief. I have also \nweighed the fact the despite his extraordinary military career, he has been unable to cope \nwith the basic rules our country requires of its citizens to file and pay taxes annually in a \ntimely manner. Moreover, Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that he \nhas resolved his tax filing delinquencies and has not established that filing delinquencies \nwill not recur in the future. Applicant\u2019s failure to show responsible behavior in timely \npreparing his tax returns for a number of years raises concerns about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Also, the potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been \nresolved at the present time. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has not \nmet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was \nentitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the \nground that it was not authenticated. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI \nsummary by failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected \nto act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their \nrights under the Directive.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd.

He explained he got into financial trouble while on active duty but had \nstarted to improve his financial situation by 2014. He cites his marriage for the decline in \nhis financial situation. (FORM Item 4 at 4.) The offered documented evidence, AE2, \nshows no evidence of a repayment plan or that he had disputed the debts with his \ncreditors.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise\nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

Applicant did not provide evidence to support his \nassertions that he had resolved his debts or had established repayment plans to have his \nfinancial situation under control by Spring 2022. The credit reports in the record reflect \ninaction on his part. \nThe absence of the debts on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report proves nothing \nabout the status of the debts except their age. Furthermore, merely waiting for a debt to \ndrop off a credit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant's favor. See, \ne.g, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information on the September 2021 \nSCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. Personal conduct security concerns are concluded \nfor Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude personal conduct security concerns were not established, but Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n Subparagraph 2.a  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His admissions \nare incorporated into my findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has worked for a government contractor as a \nmunitions technician since January 2013. He received his high school diploma in 1988. \nHe served in the Air Force on active duty from 1989 to 2001. He retired from the Air Force \nwith an honorable discharge. He is married for the second time and has three adult \nchildren and three adult stepchildren. He has held a security clearance without incident \nsince 1989. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 19 delinquent debts totaling approximately $58,000. The debts \nare comprised of a past-due mortgage account and various consumer accounts. The \ndebts are supported by credit reports from April 2021, May 2022, and July 2022; his \nstatement to an investigator in May 2020; and his SOR admissions. (Items 2, 4-7) \nApplicant stated that his financial problems arose because of a reduction in his \nwork hours in 2019. Additionally, he got behind on his mortgage payments when he was \ndiagnosed with COVID-19 in 2021, which put him out of work for about three months. \nSince that time, he provided written corroboration of his assertion that he is now current \non his mortgage payments (SOR \u00b6 1.p). That documentation also shows that he has been \ncurrent on his payments from at least July 2022. (AE A-B) \nApplicant also documented payments toward a non-SOR vehicle debt. He has \nmade consistent payments on this debt from January 2022 through October 2022. (AE \nC) \nApplicant asserted, and provided corroborating documentation, that the remaining \nunsecured SOR debts were incorporated into a debt relief payment plan (DRP) that he \nentered into in July 2019, three years before the issuance of his SOR. The DRP \ndocumentation verified that he has made monthly payments of approximately $1,300 \nsince his enrollment in the plan. The DRP has settled or is in the process of settling 28 of \nApplicant\u2019s 39 accounts.

Applicant addressed this by explaining that once the debts \nwere entered into the DRP, they were given different account numbers. The DRP \ndocumentation lists all the SOR debts by creditor name. I find that a substantial number \nof the SOR debts are being addressed by Applicant\u2019s DRP enrollment. (SOR Answer; AE \nA, C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19, and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence showed Applicant accrued several delinquent collection debts and \na past-due mortgage account. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose in 2019 when his work hours were reduced, \nwhich impacted his ability to pay his bills. Additionally, in 2021, he was out of work for \napproximately three months because of COVID-19, which caused him to fall behind on \nhis mortgage payments. These were conditions were beyond his control. He acted \nresponsibly by entering into a payment plan with a DRC in 2019. That plan addressed all \nhis unsecured SOR debts. He has made $1,300 in monthly payments since 2019 and has \nsettled or is in process of settling 28 of his debts. Additionally, he documented that he is \ncurrent on his mortgage and car payments. This evidence establishes clear indications \nthat his financial problems are being resolved and shows his good-faith efforts to resolve \nhis debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all have some applicability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service, \nhis federal contractor service, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness.

Applicant submitted a response to the FORM that is marked as Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A. He provided an additional document that is marked as AE B. There were no \nobjections to any of the documents offered and all were admitted into evidence. The case \nwas assigned to me on October 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g and 1.i, with \nexplanations. He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.h, with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 74 years old. He is a college graduate and holds a master\u2019s degree. \nHe married in 1969 and was widowed in 2004. He has an adult child from the marriage. \nHe remarried in 2006 and has two adult stepchildren. He was employed by a federal \ncontractor from 1997 until his retirement in 2006. He was unemployed for six months then \nbegan work with another federal contractor from 2006 to 2013. He went back to work for \nhis previous employer from 2013 to the present. (Item 4) \nIn 2010, Applicant withdrew $100,000 from his pension plan to pay for home \nimprovements and the purchase of two vehicles. In Applicant\u2019s November 2011 security \nclearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he was making payments on his 2010 \nfederal income tax debt and that he owed the IRS $19,000. He said he had established \nan installment agreement with the IRS to pay the debt. (Item 10) \nIn December 2011, a government investigator interviewed Applicant. He explained \nthat when he withdrew money from his pension plan, he asked that the federal taxes be \nwithheld, and he thought it was understood that he wanted to receive $100,000 after taxes \nwere withheld. He admitted he did not examine the documents as closely as he should \nhave. When he filed his 2010 federal income tax return, he realized the taxes were not \nwithheld, and he owed $30,000 to the IRS. He said he used the remaining funds he had \nleft from the withdrawal to pay some of the taxes owed and made a payment arrangement \nwith the IRS to pay $325 a month on the current balance owed at that time of $19,000. At \nthat time, he said that he intended to continue to make payments to the IRS until the debt \nwas paid. (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2019 SCA, he disclosed that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nFebruary 2017. It was dismissed in November 2018, and he and his wife planned to refile \nunder Chapter 7. He explained that his mortgage debt was being handled as a deed in \nlieu of foreclosure and the mortgage company was going to forgive the deficiency owed. \nHe also said the IRS would forgive approximately $35,000 of \u201colder debt, but not about \n$11,000 of new debt.\u201d (Item 4) He expected all of his unsecured debts to be discharged \nin bankruptcy.

He stated, \u201cLoss of income because wife [L] lost her \njob years ago, remains unemployed, and in recent years had significant medical \nexpenses.\u201d (Item 4) He estimated he owed $11,000 and further stated his actions to \nresolve the problem were through bankruptcy and by increased withholdings. (Item 4) \nIn July 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He told the \ninvestigator that he intended to resolve his financial problems through bankruptcy. He \nacknowledged that when his debts were discharged in bankruptcy, he would still be \nresponsible for his student loans. He also discussed that he had tentatively reached an \nagreement with the IRS. It had agreed to forgive $35,000 in older tax debt from \napproximately 2015, but he would still be responsible for his more recent tax debts of \nabout $11,000. He acknowledged that he had not spoken with an IRS representative \nsince November 2018. (Item 5) \nApplicant and his wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2021. Schedule E, \npriority unsecured claims reflects $56,727 (federal taxes) and Schedule F, nonpriority \nunsecured claims reflects $87,171 of student loans, consumer, and other debts. His \nbankruptcy documents reflect that his gross monthly income is $10,172 and after his \ndeductions, it is $6,346 and his monthly expenses are $7,945, leaving a monthly deficit \nof $1,598. He lists his annual income for 2020 as $174,712 and 2019 as $118,000. He \nlisted his income for 2021 from January to the date he filed bankruptcy as $90,800. His \ndebts were discharged in December 2021. (Item 6 at pages 13, 24-32, 36-42) \nIn June 2022, Applicant responded to government interrogatories. He indicated \nthat all of his federal income tax returns through tax year 2021 were filed. He stated that \nhe was verbally advised by the IRS in August 2021 that he owed taxes for 2011 ($37,949), \n2013 ($4,775), 2015 ($1,964), 2016 ($5,714) and 2018 ($6,325). (Item 5) \nApplicant further explained that in February 2022, he contacted the IRS and was \nverbally told that due to his Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in December 2021, the IRS \neliminated his 2011 and 2013 tax debt and reduced his 2015 and 2016 tax debts. The \nbankruptcy did not affect subsequent years\u2019 tax debts. He believed that the amount the \nIRS would indicate he owed was approximately $21,732 for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, \nand 2018. The 2017 tax debt included penalties and interest for failing to file on time. \nApplicant disputed that he failed to file on time. He claimed he mailed his tax return on \ntime. The IRS transcript for tax year 2017 indicates it was not filed on time. The amount \nof penalties for 2017 were approximately $6,663. He intended to resolve the disputed \namount owed with the IRS. (Item 5) \nIncluded with Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories were IRS tax transcripts, \nwhich were from May 2022. The tax transcript for tax year 2021 showed that no tax return \nwas filed. For tax year 2020, it showed an extension was granted until October 2021, and \nno tax return was filed. For tax year 2019, it showed an extension was granted until \nOctober 2020, and no tax return was filed.

The balance owed for 2018 was $6,456. \n(Item 5) \nApplicant provided IRS tax transcripts from June 2022 with this answer to the SOR. \nHis 2011 tax-year transcript showed he did not owe a current balance because in March \n2022 the IRS wrote-off the balance owed of $21,797. His 2013 tax-year transcript showed \nhe did not owe a current balance because in March 2022 the IRS wrote-off the balance \nowed of $3,277. His 2015 tax-year transcript reflected that refunds from 2020 and 2019 \n(which included the pandemic tax credits for these years) were applied to his delinquent \nbalance, and he owed a negligible amount (65 cents). His 2016 tax-year transcript \nreflected that he owed $2,537, after a refund from 2019 was applied to the delinquent \nbalance. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 tax-year transcript reflects he filed this return in October 2021 and \nhe owes a balance of $9,289. Applicant disputed the late filing penalty. He did not \ndocument a resolution from the IRS regarding the dispute. He provided a paper copy of \nhis 2017 federal income tax return date. The date is illegible and is not proof that the \nreturn was mailed and filed timely. His 2018 tax year transcript reflects he owes $6,477. \n(Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he provided paper copies of his 2019 federal \nincome tax return dated September 23, 2021. He provided a copy of a request for an \nextension for his 2019 federal income tax return, which would have extended the deadline \nto October 2020. His 2019 tax-year transcript reflects his 2019 tax return was filed in \nSeptember 2021. He was entitled to a refund that was applied to his 2015 and 2016 tax \ndebt. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he provided a paper copy of a request for an \nextension for filing his 2020 tax return. His 2020 tax-year transcript reflects he filed his \n2020 return in September 2021, and he did not owe taxes and was entitled to a refund \n($1,156). His refund was applied to his 2015 delinquent tax balance. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s 2021 tax-year transcript from June 2022 reflects that his federal income \ntax return had not been filed. The only item noted was he received a tax-relief credit of \n$1,400 (due to the pandemic) that was applied to his delinquent tax balance. In his FORM \nresponse, he included a paper copy of his 2021 tax return that shows he signed it on April \n18, 2022. There is no proof it was mailed and received by the IRS. The tax transcripts are \nthe most probative evidence. (Item 3; AE B) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he attributed his financial difficulties to his \nwife losing her job in 2010 and then her medical problems in 2015 or 2016. He also \nindicated he has provided financial and other support to two adult children and \ngrandchildren. They assist one child, who has a chronic medical condition, with her \nmedical bills and assistance in ensuring she attends appointments and other medical \nmatters. The other child and her three children continue to live with Applicant and his wife \nand they are helping her become more financially independent.

He notes the significant reduction \nin the amount he owes the IRS, due largely to its write-off of his older tax debts and \nbecause he has received tax refunds in 2019, 2020, and 2021, that were applied to his \ndelinquent tax debts. He said that he has been in contact with the IRS and agreed to an \ninstallment agreement to pay $300 a month beginning in October 2022, toward what he \nbelieves is the current balance owed of $15,880 for tax years 2016 through 2018. He did \nnot provide a copy of the installment agreement. He said he is current on his monthly \nexpenses, and he is paying delinquent gas and electric bills each month that were not \ndischarged in bankruptcy. Applicant did not provide an explanation for why he did not \ntimely pay his federal income taxes for multiple years or timely file others. He also did not \ncomment on his 2017 tax year debt. \nThe SOR alleges that in 2018 Applicant misused his company\u2019s travel credit card \nfor an ATM cash withdrawal. He admitted in his answer to the SOR that this happened, \nbut said it was inadvertent and he repaid the amount. He told the government investigator \nin his July 2019 interview that in June 2018, he was short on money to pay some of his \nwife\u2019s medical bills and decided to take money from his account and inadvertently used \nhis work credit card and withdrew $400. His employer notified him and he was given a \nverbal and written warning from his supervisor. He repaid the amount in December 2018. \n(Item 5) \nAny derogatory matters that were not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes. They may be considered when applying mitigating conditions, in \nmaking a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant had more than $50,000 of delinquent debts discharged in Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in December 2021. He had delinquent federal income taxes written off by the \nIRS, due to their age and his bankruptcy. He still owes delinquent federal income taxes \nfor multiple tax years. Applicant did not timely file his 2019. I find for Applicant regarding \nhis 2021 tax return filing. They were not due until April 2022, and it is not unusual for IRS \ntranscripts to not reflect filings for months after their receipt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) \nApplicant misused a work credit card for personal use. He told the government \ninvestigator that he was short on cash to pay his wife\u2019s medical bills and said he \ninadvertently used his work credit card. It took him six months to repay the credit card. If \nhe had inadvertently used his work credit card, he would have paid it back immediately. \nIt took him six month to reimburse his employer, supporting that he was short on cash. I \ndid not find his statement believable. AG \u00b6 19(d) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his employer\u2019s credit card happened four years ago and \nthere is no evidence that additional misuse has recurred. I find this conduct was infrequent \nand unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.i and is mitigated. \nApplicant began having tax issues in 2010, when he withdrew money from his \npension and incurred a tax debt. He attempted to resolve it, but he repeatedly failed to \ntimely pay subsequent years\u2019 income taxes, including 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. \nApplicant stated his wife\u2019s loss of her job in 2010, her medical expenses in 2015 or 2016, \nand financially supporting their children affected his finances. These were conditions \nbeyond his control. For the application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. It has been 12 years since his wife lost her job. It \nhas been seven years since she developed medical issues. Applicant has repeatedly \nfailed to ensure he paid his taxes timely, or provide evidence that he made appropriate \nadjustments to ensure his tax debt was minimized, and he has failed to timely file for \ncertain tax years. Some of his tax debts were resolved because the IRS wrote-off the \ndelinquent amounts owed, not because Applicant paid the debts. Applicant stated in his \nresponse to the FORM that he had an agreement with the IRS to make monthly payments \nto begin in October 2022. He did not provide documentary evidence of an agreement or \nthat he is in compliance. He did not provide evidence that other than recent tax refunds \nbeing applied to previous years\u2019 tax debts, that he has been making payments. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) has minimal application. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. I cannot find \nunder the circumstances that his finances are under control. In his bankruptcy documents, \nhe disclosed that his monthly expenses exceed his monthly income. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. Some of Applicant\u2019s tax debts were resolved because the IRS wrote them off. \nSome were resolved or reduced by the IRS applying subsequent years\u2019 refunds to his tax \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts. I find these are not good-faith efforts to resolve his tax debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. He does not have a reliable \nfinancial track record of paying his debts, and filing and paying his federal income taxes. \nAlthough some tax year debts are resolved, the fact that they were written off by the IRS \ndoes not reflect he acted responsibly. The fact that other delinquent tax years were paid \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nfrom refunds of subsequent tax years, also does not reflect Applicant made a good-faith \neffort to pay the taxes. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.i:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f in his Answer. Applicant is 47 years old. He married in 2007, divorced in 2010, remarried in 2018, and divorced in 2021. He has three children--two minors and one adult. He resided in state A, in a home he purchased, from October 2014 to March 2016. He lived in state B from March 2016 to May 2017. He then resided in his home in state A from May 2017 to August 2021, when he sold the home as part of his second divorce. As of his December 2021 background interview, he lived in state C since September 2021. (Answer; Form Response; Items 3, 4, 9) Applicant obtained his high school diploma in 1994. He earned a certificate from a college of aeronautics and technology in April 2014 and an associate degree in June 2019. He was consistently employed since 2007, but he voluntarily resigned in April 2017 from a managerial position that he had held since September 2014. As of his December 2021 background interview, he worked for his employer, a DOD contractor, since September 2021. He has never held a security clearance. (Items 3, 4, 9) The SOR and amended SOR allege that Applicant had six delinquent consumer debts totaling $39,894, a state tax warrant entered against him by state D in 2017 for $3,513, and a state tax lien entered against him by state B in 2018 for $1,176 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h).

I hereby sua sponte amend SOR \u00b6 1.g, pursuant \nto \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, to strike the word \u201clien\u201d and replace it with \u201cwarrant.\u201d \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f in his Answer. Applicant is 47 years \nold. He married in 2007, divorced in 2010, remarried in 2018, and divorced in 2021. He \nhas three children--two minors and one adult. He resided in state A, in a home he \npurchased, from October 2014 to March 2016. He lived in state B from March 2016 to \nMay 2017. He then resided in his home in state A from May 2017 to August 2021, when \nhe sold the home as part of his second divorce. As of his December 2021 background \ninterview, he lived in state C since September 2021. (Answer; Form Response; Items 3, \n4, 9) \nApplicant obtained his high school diploma in 1994. He earned a certificate from \na college of aeronautics and technology in April 2014 and an associate degree in June \n2019. He was consistently employed since 2007, but he voluntarily resigned in April \n2017 from a managerial position that he had held since September 2014. As of his \nDecember 2021 background interview, he worked for his employer, a DOD contractor, \nsince September 2021. He has never held a security clearance. (Items 3, 4, 9) \nThe SOR and amended SOR allege that Applicant had six delinquent consumer \ndebts totaling $39,894, a state tax warrant entered against him by state D in 2017 for \n$3,513, and a state tax lien entered against him by state B in 2018 for $1,176 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.h). Applicant listed and discussed his delinquent debts on his November 2018 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) and during his January 2019 and December 2021 \nbackground interviews. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f are reported on credit bureau reports \nfrom September 2021 and April 2022. Court documents reflect the state B tax lien in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h and the state tax warrant in SOR \u00b6 1.g. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to his second spouse\u2019s overspending, his \nsecond divorce, and the consequent child-care expenses for his two minor children. In \naddition, he experienced a decrease in income after he voluntarily resigned from his \nmanagerial position in April 2017, as previously discussed. He again experienced a \ndecrease in income due to reduced work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

He entered into a debt repayment plan with Company A in \nNovember 2018, of $295 monthly for 77 months, to resolve his outstanding debts. He \ndid not provide documentation to show that he made any payments into his plan with \nCompany A. He indicated during his December 2021 background interview that he \nretained a debt settlement law firm (Company B) to assist him with contacting his \ncreditors, negotiating settlements, and facilitating his payments after settlement. He \nstated in his Answer and FORM Response that he mistakenly believed that Company A \nand Company B would assist him with resolving his outstanding debts. He hired an \nattorney in July 2022 to assist him with contacting his creditors and negotiating \nsettlements, as further discussed below. (Answer; FORM Response; Items 3, 4, 9, 10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $9,796 collection account. Applicant indicated during his \nDecember 2021 background interview that he believed this debt was related to SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. He stated in his Answer \nthat he was working with the creditor to verify this debt. As of July 2022, his attorney \nwas assisting him with resolving this debt. (Answer; FORM Response; Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d are for two credit cards with the same creditor, in collection \nfor $8,478 and $7,842, respectively. Applicant used these credit cards for personal \npurchases. As of July 2022, his attorney was assisting him with resolving these debts \nand offered the creditor a settlement of $5,000, payable at $208 monthly over 24 \nmonths. There is no evidence that the creditor accepted Applicant\u2019s offer. (Answer; \nFORM Response; Items 4, 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $7,968 retail store credit card in collection. Applicant used this \nretail store credit card for personal purchases. As of July 2022, his attorney was \nassisting him with resolving this debt. (Answer; FORM Response; Items 4, 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $4,168 collection account. Applicant used this credit card for \npersonal purchases. He stated in his Answer and FORM Response that he contacted \nthe creditor and reached a payment arrangement of $98 monthly for 12 months to settle \nthis debt. He stated in his FORM Response that he made three payments in \naccordance with this arrangement. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his \nclaim. (Answer; FORM Response; Items 4, 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $1,642 collection account. Applicant used this credit card for \npersonal purchases. An IRS-Form 1099 C reflects that the creditor cancelled this debt, \nin the amount of $1,785, in August 2021. (Answer; FORM Response; Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are for the $3,513 tax warrant entered against Applicant by \nstate D in 2017, and the $1,176 tax lien entered against him in 2018 by state B. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the court records are the only evidence in the record of the \ntax warrant and the tax lien. Applicant indicated during his January 2019 background \ninterview that he received a letter in approximately January 2019 informing him that he \nowed approximately $1,400 in back taxes. He did not indicate which state informed him \nof his back taxes. He indicated that he was unaware that he owed back taxes until he \nreceived this letter, and that he planned to set up a payment plan to resolve his back \ntaxes. He did not provide any documentation of his efforts to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nAlthough he stated in his FORM Response that he paid $1,786 toward SOR \u00b6 1.h and \nhe intended to continue to pay his remaining balance, he did not provide documentation \nto corroborate his claim. (FORM Response; Items 7, 8, 9) \nApplicant indicated during his December 2021 background interview that his \nmonthly net income was $5,200 since he began working for his employer in September \n2021. After expenses, his monthly net remainder was approximately $400, which he \nsets aside as savings to utilize to resolve the settlements reached for his debts. He \nreceived his aviation mechanic certificate in 2012. (Items 3, 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. Applicant AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nare established. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.   \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. An IRS Form 1099-C reflects that the \ncreditor cancelled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f in August 2021, and I find that allegation in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant began trying to resolve his debts in November 2018, when he entered \ninto a debt repayment plan with Company A. However, he did not provide \ndocumentation to show that he made any payments to Company A as part of that plan. \nAlthough he indicated during his December 2021 background interview that he \nsubsequently retained Company B to assist him with resolving his debts, he also did not \nprovide any documentation to corroborate his claim. As of July 2022, his attorney was \nassisting him with resolving SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. While his attorney made an offer of \nsettlement for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d, there is no evidence that the creditor accepted this \noffer. Applicant also did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that he \nentered into a payment arrangement for SOR \u00b6 1.e and made three payments \naccordingly. He also did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that he paid \n$1,786 toward SOR \u00b6 1.h, or of his efforts to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.g. There is no evidence \nthat he received any financial counseling. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not applicable as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, 1.g, \nand 1.h. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g - 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between September 1986 and December 2021 (SOR 1.a); and that Applicant intends to use marijuana in the future. (SOR 1.b) In response to the SOR, she admitted SOR 1.a and denied, with explanation, SOR 1.b. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR 1.a, and based on my review of the information presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom she has worked since August 2019 as company vice president. This appears to be her first application for a security clearance. Her employer wants her to fill a position other than the one she now holds. The new position requires she be eligible for access to classified information. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) Applicant has been married since 1992, the same year she graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree. She started using marijuana in 1986, when she was 18 years old. She has used marijuana with varying frequency through at least December 2021. The state where she lives and works legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes in 2018. In February 2020, a doctor prescribed for her a license to buy marijuana to treat her insomnia.

The adjudicative guidelines (AG) applied throughout the adjudication \nof this case were issued by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, \n2016, and have been applied in all adjudicative actions taken on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on September 21, 2022. The FORM contained four \nexhibits (Items 1 \u2013 4) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the Government\u2019s \nexhibits or to provide other additional information. She did not submit any further \ninformation and she did not file any objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits within the \nallotted time. The record closed on October 21, 2022, and I received the case for decision \non December 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between \nSeptember 1986 and December 2021 (SOR 1.a); and that Applicant intends to use \nmarijuana in the future. (SOR 1.b) In response to the SOR, she admitted SOR 1.a and \ndenied, with explanation, SOR 1.b. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR 1.a, and based on my review of the \ninformation presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom she has \nworked since August 2019 as company vice president. This appears to be her first \napplication for a security clearance. Her employer wants her to fill a position other than \nthe one she now holds. The new position requires she be eligible for access to classified \ninformation. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) \nApplicant has been married since 1992, the same year she graduated from college \nwith a bachelor\u2019s degree. She started using marijuana in 1986, when she was 18 years \nold. She has used marijuana with varying frequency through at least December 2021. \nThe state where she lives and works legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes \nin 2018. In February 2020, a doctor prescribed for her a license to buy marijuana to treat \nher insomnia. Since then, she smokes \u201ca small bowl\u201d of marijuana two or three times a \nweek in the privacy of her own home. Before receiving her medical marijuana prescription, \nApplicant bought marijuana illegally from a variety of sources. (FORM, Item 4) \nIn response to questions in Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of her \ne-QIP, Applicant disclosed her drug use and stated she would continue to use marijuana \nfor medical purposes as allowed by law in her state.

She further stated she knows using \nmarijuana is still a violation of federal law. Additionally, she stated that if her drug use is \nan impediment to being approved for a security clearance, she would ask her employer \nto find someone else to fill the position that requires a clearance rather than stop using \nmarijuana. However, Applicant also allowed that if her employer insisted that she fill the \nnew position, she would give up her marijuana use, but such would not be her first choice. \nHer response to SOR 1.b is consistent with her statements on this issue during her PSI. \n(FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013 and by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in December 2021 make \nclear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, territories, \nand the District of Columbia do not alter the current National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this issue, Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in her state of residence, is \nillegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by civilian federal employees \nand by persons employed for work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant has illegally purchased, possessed, and used marijuana for most of the \npast 35 years. Since February 2020, she has relied on her state\u2019s legalization of marijuana \nfor medical purposes as a means of obtaining marijuana; however, between 1986 and \n2020, she purchased marijuana illegally. Applicant is aware that marijuana use is still a \nviolation of federal law. This information reasonably raises the security concern about \ndrug involvement stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy contrast, I have considered the potential applicability of the pertinent mitigating \nconditions presented under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. It thus fell to Applicant to present \ninformation that warrants application of any pertinent mitigating conditions. In response to \nthe SOR and the FORM, Applicant did not present information that would support any of \nthese mitigating conditions. Her history of drug use is extensive, occurring as it has for \nmuch of the past 35 years. Since 2020, she has used marijuana two or three times a week. \nHer statements regarding future intent are ambiguous at best. In her clearance application, \nshe stated her unqualified intent to use. She largely repeated that level of intent during her \nPSI; however, she also indicated then and in her Answer that she would consider \nabstaining from using marijuana if it would disqualify her from filling the new position. This \nis hardly a definitive statement of intent to discontinue using illegal drugs. \nFinally, while her drug use is legal under the laws of her state, Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana is still impermissible under federal controlled substances laws as well as DOD \nindustrial security policy guidance. On balance, Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns established by the Government\u2019s information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s past use \nof marijuana, as well as the likelihood she will continue to use marijuana, conflict with \nfederal government policies against such conduct. Her response to the Government\u2019s \ninformation strengthens the doubts raised about her judgment, reliability, and willingness \nto follow rules and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive information. Because \nthe protection of the national interest is the principal goal of these adjudications, those \ndoubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

As of his October \n2021 security clearance application (SCA), he worked as an application specialist and \ndeveloper for his employer, a DOD contractor, since June 2021. He has owned his \nhome since October 2021. He has never held a security clearance. (Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from July 2001 \nthrough at least November 2021. He used marijuana more than once weekly, as a \ncollege student, between 2001 and 2006. Since college, he has used marijuana \noccasionally, less than once monthly, socially or as a sleep aid. He smoked marijuana \nout of a pipe, or he ingested it through gummies. It made him feel relaxed. He could not \napproximate the total number of times he has used marijuana. (Answer; GE 1, 2; FORM \nResponse) \nApplicant indicated during his December 2021 background interview that he \ncould not recall if he used marijuana between May 2021 and August 2021. However, he \ndid not use marijuana between August 2021 and November 2021. He indicated that he \nlast used marijuana in November 2021, which was after he completed his SCA. He \nstated in his SCA that he did not have \u201ca specific intention about when to use or how to \nuse [marijuana], but any use would be occasional, socially or as sleep aid. It is not \nsomething I would seek out for regular use.\u201d (Answer; GE 1, 2; FORM Response) \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he did not have any \nfuture intent to use marijuana if his employment permitted him to use it, but he would \nstop using it if it his employment prohibited it. In March 2022, Applicant declared his \nintention to abstain from future use of marijuana \u201cwhile active with any contract work for \nthe DOD.\u201d He continued to associate with individuals who used marijuana. He stated in \nhis Answer, \u201cit would be [undesirable]/unrealistic for me to stop associating with some of \nthese individuals as they are life-long friends and/or family.\u201d He further stated, \u201c[m]y \nclose contacts would not say that my [marijuana] use has negatively impacted my ability \nto uphold my social and professional responsibilities.\u201d He has a long history of \nproductive employment.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . .\u201d; \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana between 2001 and November 2021. He continues to \nassociate with individuals who use marijuana. He also stated that he would not use \nmarijuana in the future if the DOD employed him or if his employer prohibited it, but that \nhe did not have a specific intent regarding marijuana use if his employer permitted it. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are established. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant acknowledged that he still associated with individuals who use \nmarijuana. In addition, his use of marijuana spanned a period of approximately 20 \nyears. He used marijuana as recently as November 2021, after he completed his SCA. \nHis declared intention, in March 2022, to abstain from future use of marijuana, was \ncontingent on performing \u201cany contract work for the DOD.\u201d The record evidence \ncontinues to raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I \nfind that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. at 43-55; AE A, B, C) \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over \n1.4 billion people. The PRC has an authoritarian government, dominated by the \nChinese Communist Party. The PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights \nand suppresses political dissent. Its practices include official repression of the freedoms \nof speech, religion, movement, association, and assembly; forced confessions; torture; \nmistreatment of prisoners; and arbitrary arrest, detention, and killings.  \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States and is one of the two \nmost active collectors of U.S. economic intelligence and technology. The PRC also \nsometimes uses coercion or blackmail to manipulate its citizens overseas to conduct \ninfluence operations on behalf of the PRC, such as threatening ethnic Uyghurs living in \nthe United States with imprisonment of their family members in China. Additionally, the \nPRC targets individuals in other countries to support its acquisition of foreign \ntechnology. The PRC\u2019s \u201cThousand Talents Program\u201d seeks to recruit individuals \nprimarily, but not exclusively, from relevant diaspora populations and recent emigrants \nfrom the PRC, as well as foreign national experts whose recruitment the PRC views as \nnecessary to its scientific and technical modernization, especially with regard to defense \ntechnology. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws are citizens and residents of China. In-laws \nrepresent a class of persons who are contemplated by the Directive as presenting a \npotential security risk. As a matter of common sense and human experience, there is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the \nimmediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-06831 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2011). \nChina has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Communist Party, with \na poor human rights record, and it aggressively targets the U.S. for espionage. \nApplicant\u2019s Chinese connections create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both \ndirectly to him and through his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been raised by the \nevidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, \n499 U.S. 905 (1991). I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China and the \nadversarial relationship China has with the United States. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2019). Because of that adversarial relationship, Applicant \nhas a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d of persuasion as to mitigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019). In foreign influence cases, the nature of the foreign \ngovernment and its intelligence-gathering history are important considerations. There is \na rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are \nadverse to those of the United States and the risk that the applicant may fail to protect \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-08412 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, \n2015).  \nI also considered the strong ties Applicant has to the United States. His \nimmediate family have been in the United States for about 30 years (wife and older \nchild) or were born in the United States (younger child and grandchild). He is not \nparticularly close to his siblings, having spent his entire adult life living somewhere other \nthan the rural area where he grew up. That connection is even less since his parents \npassed away. He has not visited China since 2016, and with his parents deceased, he \nhas no immediate plans to return. His relatives in China are farmers, and his in-laws are \nretired. He has lived in the same house in the United States since the late 1990s. He \ndoes not have any assets in China, and he has about $2 million in assets in the United \nStates. He credibly professed his allegiance to the United States and that he would \nreport any attempt to use his family in China against him. \nI find that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and the interests of the Chinese government \nor his Chinese family members. I further find there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in America, that \nhe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He \nsettled the matter for $14,500, payable in monthly payments of $604, starting in April \n2021 and ending in March 2023. (Items 1-6) I am satisfied that Applicant has made the \nmonthly payments, and he will continue to make them until the settlement amount is \npaid in full. \nA collection company sued Applicant for about $3,150 that was originally owed to \na bank (SOR \u00b6 1.f).

(Items 1, 4) \nApplicant cites the following as the investigator\u2019s comments in the report of \ninvestigation of his background interview: \u201cSubject\u2019s civil suits cannot be used for \nblackmail\u201d; and \u201cThere is nothing in Subject\u2019s background to include any of the above \ndiscussed information that could be used to blackmail or coerce him.\u201d (Item 3; AE A) \nThose are not the investigator\u2019s comments; they are the investigator\u2019s summarizations \nof Applicant\u2019s answers to the investigator\u2019s questions. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nThe evidence indicates that it was initially difficult for him to pay his debts, but once the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts were delinquent for more than three years, he relied on the statute of limitations, \nand he chose not to pay those debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) are applicable.  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the expenses of raising five children \nand his son defaulting on a student loan that Applicant cosigned, which caused the \ninterest rates on his credit cards to rise. His son\u2019s actions were beyond his control. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) also requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant was sued by several creditors. He settled and paid two debts that were \nnot alleged in the SOR; and he settled and is paying the settlement amount to the \ncreditor for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. That debt is mitigated. \nApplicant agreed to settle the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but never paid the \nsettlement amount. He has not paid any of the remaining SOR debts, and he does not \nintend to pay them. He indicated that he would have found a way to settle the debts if \nthe creditors had filed a lawsuit, but they never bothered to file suit. He stated that the \nthree-year statute of limitations has passed, which means that he \u201ccannot be sued and \nthe debt becomes uncollectable, leaving no incentive to settle any longer.\u201d He stated \nthat because the debts are uncollectable, there is \u201cno basis for coercion or \ncompromise.\u201d \nApplicant may be correct that he is not subject to coercion or compromise, but \nthat is not the only security concern generated by financial problems. The concern is \nbroader than the possibility that a person might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person \nwho is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in \nhandling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe Appeal Board has long recognized that debts remain relevant for security \nclearance purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the \nstatute of limitations. That is, a judge may consider the underlying circumstances of \nthese uncollectable debts in evaluating whether an applicant demonstrated good \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. \nBd. Mar. 27, 2003). Reliance on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-\nfaith effort to resolve debts and is of limited mitigative value. See e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01231 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2015). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of minimal mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 18, 2021, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On July 15, 2022, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services \n(CAS), previously known as the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order \n(Exec.

(Item 2) On August 9, 2022, pursuant \nto \u00b6 E.3.1.13, of the Directive, the Government amended the SOR by withdrawing SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 1.d. through1.h., leaving only SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on August 11, 2022, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on September 6, 2022. Her response was due on October 6, 2022. Applicant \ntimely responded to the FORM, submitted 12 documents that were marked and admitted \nwithout objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through AE 12.  \nApplicant objected to two of the Government Exhibits listed in the FORM. She \nobjected to the \u201cunauthenticated\u201d and unverified enhanced subject interview (Item 4), and \nto an \u201cinaccurate\u201d credit bureau report (Item 5), as well as to \u201cinaccurate\u201d arguments made \nby Department Counsel. I overruled the objections in part because the information in the \ncredit report was relevant and material to the issues, it was verified by Applicant in other \ndocuments, and such evidence is acceptable in DOHA security clearance eligibility \npractice; the information in the arguments does not constitute evidence in such cases; \nand the focused information in the subject interview was actually verified by Applicant in \nother submissions.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the \nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

She was previously employed by \nanother employer as a technical operations staff member from June 2007 until November \n2010. It is unclear if she is a high school graduate.

She indicated \nthat the issue was created because of insufficient budgeting, and that she was awaiting \na Chapter 13 bankruptcy determination (regarding a repossessed automobile) that she \nactually dismissed in about March 2020. (Item 3 at 33-34) On September 27, 2021, she \nwas interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). \nDuring that interview, she disclosed and described the two delinquent student loans that \nwere in the amounts of $108,504 and $104,490. She said that she originally had four \nseparate student loans that were consolidated into two student loans. She claimed that \nthe loans had been transferred and sold so many times that she was not able to keep \ntrack of them, and was unsure which entity was holding the accounts at the time of her \ninterview. The investigator furnished the address of the creditor listed in her credit report. \n(Item 4 at 2) \nApplicant received student loans that enabled her to obtain degrees in 2000 and \n2006. The loan servicer handling her student loans reported a favorable payment history \nuntil about December 2014. (Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 12, 13, 15, 17) Because of her failure \nto continue making timely payments, after a period of about 90 days, Applicant\u2019s student \nloans were assigned to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), eventually designated \nas defaulted loans, and placed for collection. \nApplicant did not claim that at that time she had sought either different payment \narrangements or either deferment or forbearance. She did not report any specific factors, \nother than \u201cirresponsible lack of budgeting\u201d; \u201cincreased living expenses\u201d after moving to \nanother state; past immaturity; and \u201cunexpected medical surgery in August 2018\u201d that \nmay have contributed to her inability to keep her student-loan accounts or her automobile \naccount current between 2014 and at least July 2020. Although she claimed she satisfied \nher automobile debt in July 2020 after she had her bankruptcy dismissed, her 2018 \nsurgery debt went unresolved until she made payments totaling approximately $4,847 on \nJuly 27-28, 2022. (Item 2; Response to FORM, dated August 9, 2022; AE 10) Her history \nof addressing her student-loan debts remains less than clear, for aside for any payments \nshe may have made in September 2022, described further below, she apparently made \nonly one payment in December 2018 for $1,133.62. (AE 2; AE 3) Although she claims \nthat her payment history shows that payments were made on the accounts, it is unclear \nif those payments were voluntary payments made by her or merely bookkeeping \nadjustments between loan servicers and the DOE. In this regard, a payment history \nreflecting payments to the loan servicer reflects \u201cpayments\u201d of $182,075.45 on July 1, \n2017, and $153,749.98 on December 3, 2014.

(DOE Press Release, \nAugust 24, 2022)  On April 6, 2022, the DOE announced an initiative called \u201cFresh Start\u201d \nto help eligible borrowers whose loans were in default. Among the benefits of the new \nprogram were that the CARES relief pause would continue, collection efforts would cease, \nand wages would not be garnished. (AE 8) On August 11, 2022, Applicant sought \nguidance from a non-profit organization regarding student debt relief, and stated that she \ncurrently had $212,000 in federal student debt, consisting of a direct consolidation un-\nsubsidized loan for $104,491 and a direct consolidation subsidized loan for $108,505.  \nShe identified the original and the second loan servicers. (AE 9) The following day, she \nsubmitted to the DOE an extract of her Form 1040 for the tax year 2021 as part of her \neffort to seek student loan rehabilitation. (AE 5) \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that she was currently investigating the \nstatus of the loans along with the applicable fees and charges to insure the accuracy of \nthe information alleged. She claimed that she had initiated contact with the creditor on \nJuly 20, 2022 \u2013 five days after the SOR was issued, and the day ---\nafter her Answer was \ndated \u2013 requesting the loan documentation with the goal of getting them out of the \ndelinquency status \u201conce the Federal student loan payment freeze is lifted.\u201d (Item 2 at 2)  \nOn August 23, 2022 \u2013 approximately five weeks after the SOR was issued \u2013  \nApplicant and the DOE established a Repayment Agreement covering two delinquent \nstudent-loan debts for $108,504.94 ($85,899.65 in principal and $22,605.29 in interest) \nand $104,490.61 ($82,721.70 in principal and $21,768.91 in interest), totaling \n$212,995.55. It was determined that her regular monthly payment amount would be \n$1,085, commencing on September 13, 2022. Once she made at least nine monthly \npayments and complied with all of the provisions of the agreement, her student-loan debt \nwould be rehabilitated.

Applicant has steadfastly disputed \nthat she has a history of not meeting financial obligations or an inability to satisfy debts. \nShe stated that she has the ability to satisfy her debts. There is a paucity of evidence to \nindicate how her financial issues \u2013 especially her delinquent student loans \u2013 were handled \nby her between 2014 and 2022. Nevertheless, it appears that Applicant is currently in a \nbetter position financially than she had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe Amended SOR alleged two still-delinquent student-loan accounts totaling \napproximately $212,994. On its face, without any background information, Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of still-delinquent debts appears to present either an inability to satisfy debts, or a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. Despite her claims that there is no history of \nnot meeting financial obligations or an inability to satisfy them, the evidence clearly \nsupports a conclusion that both conditions have been established. Considering her \nincome in 2021, her apparent disinterest in focusing on her student-loan accounts \nbetween 2014 and March 2020, when the CARES Act temporarily paused payments and \ninvoluntary collections on most federally held student loans, support a conclusion that she \nalso had a reluctance or unwillingness to satisfy those debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) minimally apply, but none of the other conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were assigned to the DOE, eventually designated as defaulted \nloans, and placed for collection. She did not claim that she had sought either different \npayment arrangements or either deferment or forbearance. She did not report any specific \nfactors, other than \u201cirresponsible lack of budgeting\u201d; \u201cincreased living expenses\u201d after \nmoving to another state; past immaturity; and \u201cunexpected medical surgery in August \n2018\u201d, that may have contributed to her inability to keep her student-loan accounts current \nbetween 2014 and at least March 2020, when the CARES Act payment pause \ncommenced. Aspects of her situation and her actions, or inaction, in addressing her \ndelinquent student loans, are troubling. Between the date she first learned that her \nstudent-loan accounts had been defaulted, and the date the SOR was issued, she made \nno claimed or verifiable efforts to address either of the delinquent student loans. It was \nonly after the SOR was issued that she was motivated to take any action. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it is clear that Applicant intentionally ignored her delinquent \nstudent-loan accounts for a substantial multi-year period. The overwhelming evidence \nleads to the conclusion that her financial problems were not under control, and that the \ninitial efforts to fix her problem did not start until August 2022 when she signed her \nrepayment agreement. She acted irresponsibly by failing to address her delinquent \nstudent-loan accounts and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with her \nloan servicers or DOE creditors before the SOR was issued. The Appeal Board has \npreviously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.

(See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to offer any evidence that she began making such \nefforts until the SOR was issued. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that no \nsuch efforts were made until after the SOR was issued. Her first payments were made in \nSeptember 2022. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling. Despite her very recent \nefforts to start rehabilitating her delinquent student-loan accounts after several years of \ninaction, Applicant\u2019s inaction under the circumstances casts doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \nsupplier quality engineer since November 2010. She was previously employed by another \nemployer as a technical operations staff member from June 2007 until November 2020. \nShe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s degree in 2006. She was \ngranted a secret clearance in 2011. In August 2022, Applicant and the DOE established \na Repayment Agreement covering two delinquent student-loan debts, and she started \nmaking monthly payments in September 2022. She has no other delinquent debts. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has two still-delinquent student-loan accounts \ntotaling approximately $212,994. She seemingly attributed some of her financial \ndifficulties to \u201cirresponsible lack of budgeting\u201d past immaturity that may have contributed \nto her inability to keep her student-loan accounts current between 2014 and at least March \n2020, when the CARES Act payment pause commenced. She described no contacts with \nthe loan servicer or the DOE between December 2014, when the student loans were \nplaced in default, and July 2022, when the SOR was issued. Instead, she seemingly \navoided any good-faith efforts to resolve those delinquent debts. In light of her disinterest \nto take any such actions until the SOR was issued, there are lingering questions if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of nearly zero claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the \ntwo delinquent student-loan debts and the lengthy period of non-contact with her \ncreditors, is negative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nher financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the three allegations listed in the SOR, with explanations. He admitted using marijuana from 2009 to July 2022, including use of the drug after completing and certifying an e-QIP on November 30, 2021.

He uses the \ndrug to relax when he is at home. Until purchase of the drug became legal in a state \nnearby (State X), he would purchase it from drug sellers or acquaintances. He travels to \nState X to purchase the drug legally, and uses it in State Y, where recreational \npossession and use of marijuana is legal. Applicant omitted the marijuana use from his \nNovember 2021 e-QIP because it was an oversight. (Item 4 at 6-7, 10) \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use has not produced any legal or disciplinary action, \nexcept for the discharge in December 2009. After the OPM investigator informed \nApplicant in January 2022 that recreational use of marijuana was not legal at the federal \nlevel, and could affect his security clearance application, Applicant indicated that he \nwould stop immediately. There is no indication that he stopped. Rather, he stated in \nAugust 2022 interrogatory answers that his last use of the drug was on July 30, 2022, \nand he had no marijuana in his possession. In his August 2022 answer to the SOR, he \nstated he would stop if granted a security clearance.

(Item 4 at 4-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c - Applicant stated that he began using Percocet, Vicodin, and \nOxyContin in May 2008 to \u201cescape from life\u2019s problems and to self-medicate himself.\u201d \n(Item 4 at 5) He purchased the prescription medications from drug sellers or \nacquaintances that he could not recall and in amounts that he could not remember. He \nused the drugs alone at home or with one or two friends that he could not remember. \nOccasionally he would not use the drugs for periods of up to one year. The Applicant \nhad no adverse reaction to the drugs, but his addictive use was a pivotal factor in his \ndivorce, loss of friends, and significant loss of money due to his addiction. He used the \nmedications until September 2017, when he voluntarily sought treatment. (Item 4 at 5) \nAfter a couple of unsuccessful attempts, Applicant discovered an effective \ntreatment regimen with a substance abuse counselor in September 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nThe treatment consisted of group counseling one to three times a week in hour-long \nsessions. The counselor persuaded Applicant to become more conscientious about his \ntreatment. He has taken no opiates since September 2017, when he began taking Sub \nOxone daily prescribed by the doctor who was collaborating with the counselor at the \ntime. Sub Oxone is a prescription drug that decreases the user\u2019s dependence on \nopiates. Applicant stopped his treatment with the substance abuse counselor but \ncontinued his Sub Oxone prescription and opiate addiction treatment with another \ndoctor who could prescribe Sub Oxone to him which the substance abuse counselor \ncould not. Since 2017, Applicant has received treatment from the doctor once a month, \nthen once every six weeks. He claims that he has never been diagnosed by a medical \nprofessional with opiate dependence or addiction. Rather, he has always self-diagnosed \nhis addiction. Given the treatment and medication he has received since September \n2017, it seems to me that regardless of his self-diagnosis, his treating doctor has \nessentially confirmed his opiate dependence. In January 2022, he believed his addiction \nwas under control and he has continued to receive treatment. He is determined not to \nuse opiates in the future. (Item 4 at 5-6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of a \nmemorandum issued by the Director of National Intelligence on October 28, 2014, \nexplaining compliance with federal laws prohibiting marijuana use. The memorandum \nindicates that no state can sanction violations of the Controlled Substances Act that \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes in state law \n(including the laws of the District of Columbia) regarding marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. Third, a person\u2019s disregard for the federal law \nrelating to use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains germane to eligibility \ndecisions for sensitive national security positions.  \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia;  \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance abuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such use.  \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2009 at a frequency of one or two times \nweekly, and continued using at that frequency until at least July 30, 2022. While in the \nANG in September 2009, he received a random drug urinalysis and tested positive for \nmarijuana. In December 2009, he received a general discharge under honorable \nconditions. He continued using the drug after he submitted an e-QIP in November 2021. \nDuring his January 2022 PSI, the OPM investigator advised Applicant that recreational \nmarijuana use was not legal at the federal level, and could affect Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance application. He informed the investigator that he would immediately stop \nusing marijuana. His last use of the drug was during a vacation in July 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25 \n(a), (b), and (c) apply. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that drug involvement \nfollowing the completion of a security clearance application raises serious concerns \nabout an applicant\u2019s judgment and willingness to follow the rules, specifically when the \napplicant has been placed on notice of the consequences of drug use. See ISCR Case \nNo. 16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017; ISCR Case No. 15-01905 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. \n19. 2017. Based on these Appeal Board holdings, AG \u00b6 25(f) also applies to Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued use of marijuana following his November 2021 e-QIP, after he stated he \nwould stop in his January 2022 PSI, and at least until his vacation in July 2022, as he \nindicated in his August 2022 answer to the SOR. AG \u00b6 25(g) applies because of the \ncontradictory positions taken by Applicant concerning his failure to abstain from future \nmarijuana use.  \nApplicant used the prescription medications Percocet, Vicodin, and OxyContin, \nnot prescribed to him, from May 2008 to the beginning of treatment in September 2017. \nHe used the medications alone or with one or two friends. He purchased the drugs from \ndrug sellers or acquaintances. While Applicant emphasized that he had no adverse \nreaction to the opiates, he realized that that the drugs played a large part in his divorce \nin 2010, the loss of his friends, and the loss of a large amount of money used to \npurchase the medications. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s use and purchase \nof prescription medications not prescribed to him. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) has limited application. Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana \nand prescription medications cannot be viewed separately, because his use of both \ndrugs overlapped and were ingested to relieve anxiety of one kind or another. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and 26(d) mitigates Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of prescription \nmedications that were not prescribed to him. After failing to matriculate in two drug \ntreatment programs, he did not give up. Instead, he began receiving effective treatment \nfrom a substance abuse counselor in September 2017. During the course of regular \ncounseling, the counselor successfully persuaded Applicant to take his treatment \nseriously. Along with the counseling, the counselor\u2019s collaborating doctor prescribed \nSub Oxone to Applicant on a daily basis. Since September 2017, Applicant has been \nregularly taking the prescribed medication and regularly consulting the prescribing \ndoctor. He has repeatedly indicated that he has not used any unprescribed medication \nsince September 2017, and is determined not to use them in the future. In sum, \nApplicant\u2019s nine-year period of addiction to prescription medications that were not \nprescribed to him is sufficiently mitigated by five years of abstinence combined with a \nstrong recovery program. \nHowever, Applicant has not mitigated his marijuana use and purchases. After \nhe began using marijuana in 2009, he tested positive for the drug while he was in the \nANG in September 2009, leading to his General discharge in December 2009. He knew \nwhen he was tested that his drug use could result in his discharge from the ANG. \nIn his January 2022 PSI, after the OPM investigator advised him that marijuana \nuse was illegal at the federal level, he stated that he would stop immediately. In his \nAugust 2022 response to interrogatories, he indicated his last use of the drug was \nduring his vacation in July 2022. In his August 23, 2022 answer to the SOR, he \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicated he would not use marijuana in the future if he were granted a security \nclearance. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(b)\u2019s application to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, Applicant has \nfurnished insufficient evidence of severing ties with drug users. He has not supplied \nenough evidence to show that he has transitioned to an environment where marijuana is \nnot used. Finally, he has not provided a signed sworn statement underscoring an \nintention to abstain in the future or risk revocation of security clearance eligibility. Given \nhis recent contradictory positions about marijuana use in the future, Applicant has not \nsubmitted sufficient mitigating evidence under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (b). AG \u00b6 25 (d) is \nunavailable to mitigate because Applicant\u2019s drug treatment was designed to eradicate \nhis misuse of prescribed medications. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has illegally used marijuana since 2009. He was discharged from the \nmilitary in December 2009 because of his marijuana use. He has consistently used the \ndrug until July 2022. The fact that his doctor advocates his marijuana use because of \nmental issues does not excuse or sanction his use for security clearance purposes. The \nproper safeguarding classified information is a 24-hour obligation regardless of whether \nan applicant is at work or away from work. Based on Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of illegal \nmarijuana use and the lack of persuasive evidence that that he intends to cease using \nthe drug in the future, Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for security clearance access is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 21, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On September 24, 2021, she provided an interview (PSI) with \nan investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

She was unemployed from October 2014 \nto December 2015. In the previous five years, Applicant was correction officer at a \ndetention facility. (GE 3 at 10-16; GE 6 at unnumbered first page) \nApplicant signed and certified an e-QIP on August 21, 2021. She listed no \ndelinquent debts in response to Section 26 of the application requiring information about \ndelinquent taxes, delinquent accounts, and other financial issues. In her September \n2021 PSI, she claimed that she had no accounts turned over for collection. The OPM \ninvestigator then confronted her with the delinquent debts appearing in her credit report. \nApplicant agreed with the information in the credit report, but believed that she did not \nhave to disclose the delinquent accounts in her e-QIP because they were more than \nseven years ago. During her two periods of unemployment, she used credit cards and \nloans to pay for gas, her son\u2019s school supplies, and other basic needs. Applicant has \nnot made any agreements to address the past-due accounts because her current \nincome is not sufficient to make payments. She intended to hire a debt consolidation \nservice to set up payment plans with the creditors and collection companies. Currently, \nshe does not buy anything she does not need, and does not purchase unnecessary \nitems for her son. (Item 3 at 30; Item 6 at 5-6) \nIn her undated response to the FORM, Applicant claimed that she paid over \n$46,000 to satisfy four medical accounts, an installment car loan, and a credit card \naccount, in the last two years. No independent evidence, e.g., payment receipts, bank \nledgers, credit bureau reports, or similar documentation was presented to substantiate \nher claim. She currently helps her parents financially with utilities, groceries, car \ninsurance, and cable. She is currently trying to build a home for herself and her son on \na piece of real estate that her father has owned for the last 20 years. (Response to \nFORM) \nApplicant encountered financial difficulties when she lost her job and could not \nfind employment. She relied on bad advice from a close family member that even if she \npaid off the delinquent debts, it would still negatively affect her credit score. If she \nreceives her security clearance, she will be able to earn more money and begin to \nnegotiate payment plans to repay the creditors and collection agencies.

Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying her voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence shows that she is not paying her debts in a timely fashion. Rather than \nignore the accounts after they fall delinquent, an applicant should exercise good \njudgment by alerting the creditors of her financial predicament, even if she has already \nstopped making payments because of insufficient funds. Adverse evidence from credit \nreports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving delinquent debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government credit reports establish that all of the \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts listed in the SOR have been delinquent since August and September 2021. \nApplicant informed the investigator that she had not negotiated payment plans with any \nof the creditors or collection agencies because she could not afford payments. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) does not apply because I find Applicant is willing to \nrepay the delinquent debts, but lacks the funds to repay. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes about $49,000 in \ndelinquent debt to six creditors or collection agencies. With no evident changes in her \nfinancial practices, they will probably persist in the future. Her failure to take charge of \nher delinquent debt responsibilities continues to raises doubts about her reliability and \njudgment. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from October 2014 to December 2015, and from \nSeptember 2017 to March 2019, was largely beyond her control. The loss of her income \nhad an adverse impact on her bill-paying ability. However, for the mitigating condition to \nbe fully applicable, an applicant must provide credible documented evidence that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been steadily employed since \nApril 2019, but has done nothing to address her delinquent debt. This three-year period \nof inaction clearly shows that she did not act reasonably and responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application to the surrounding circumstances of \nthis case. \nThe lack of financial counseling, evidence of a budget, or participation in a debt \nconsolidation service, removes AG \u00b6 20(c) from consideration. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts are not being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because \nApplicant is not engaged in a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that her delinquent \ndebts are being resolved or under control. Although the listed debts may no longer be \nlegally enforceable because seven years has passed under a state statute of limitations, \nthe debts are still significant for security clearance purposes. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016) Relying on a statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to eliminate delinquent debts for an applicant who aspires \nfor a security clearance. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) In \nGuideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish her \ncase in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \nrepayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the \nSOR is paid, the applicant must show that she has a plan for debt resolution and has \ntaken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) Judging by the totality of all the evidence, Applicant has no plan \nin place and has furnished no evidence of even sporadic payments on the past due \naccounts. After a full review of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of \nview, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems have not been mitigated.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

(AppX A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used numerous illegal substances over a period of twelve years. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nAlthough Applicant has signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse in the future, her twelve years of usage ended only \n18 months prior to her hearing. It is too soon to say that her rather extensive history of \ndrug use is not of present security significance. Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is found against Applicant. However, this should not dissuade Applicant from \napplying for a security clearance in the future, with the passage of at least another year \nof continued abstinence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant\u2018s supervisor speaks most highly of Applicant. (AppX B.)

Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from her drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~ 1i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(GE 3 at 3) A close ally, Ghana hosted the first \ncohort of U.S. Peace Corps volunteers. (Id.) It is a model for resilient financial institutions, \ntransparent and peaceful transfers of power, and regional stability in West Africa. The \nUnited States and Ghana have close commercial interests, as the United States is Ghana\u2019s \nlargest trading partner, and approximately 100 U.S. multi-national corporations do business \nin Ghana.

When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel[.]\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Moreover, \u201cthey may also be a national security concern if \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests \nor otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign influence.\u201d(Id.) The \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7 are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of our resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(e) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or \nin any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nThe applicability of each of these disqualifying conditions is contingent upon a \nheightened risk analysis, considering factors such as the nature of the foreign government, \nany history of intelligence gathering against the United States, the country\u2019s human rights \nrecord, the risk of terrorism, and the nature of the country\u2019s relationship with the United \nStates. (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) Ghana is a representative \ndemocracy. It has a strong relationship with the United States, a growing investment \nmarket, and it is a partner in defense and law enforcement matters. While the U.S. State \nDepartment fact sheet enclosed within GE 3 addresses these matters in depth, there is no \nmention of any problems with terrorism, human rights violations, or espionage against the \nUnited States. Nevertheless, friendly countries can commit espionage, or have profound \ndisagreements with the United States, as readily as hostile ones. (ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n22461 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)) Consequently, although the risk is small in comparison to \nthe risk posed by a hostile country or a strategic competitor, it is heightened, nonetheless. \nUnder these circumstances, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e), and 7(f) apply. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his half-sister is casual and infrequent. Consequently, this \nrelationship is mitigated by AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. I resolve subparagraph 1.d in his favor. \nApplicant is clearly close to his adopted child and two stepchildren living in Ghana. \nAlthough the property he owns in Ghana is undeveloped, and the bank account is inactive, \nhis children live in the home his wife owns and Applicant considers it their family home. \nConversely, Applicant has been living in the United States for more than ten years, three of \nhis children, including a son in the U.S. Army, live here, his wife recently joined him here, \nand they are working on helping his Ghanaian children immigrate here. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his adopted child and stepchildren living in Ghana.  \nThe Ghanaian bank accounts of Applicant and his wife have nominal amounts of \nmoney deposited in them. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely \nto result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure \nthe individual,\u201d applies. I resolve subparagraph 1.h in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe value of Applicant and his wife\u2019s real estate interests are not insignificant, \nparticularly given that Applicant does not own property in the United States. However, as \none property is undeveloped, and the other is for the children who are in the process of \nimmigrating to the United States, their Ghanaian real estate is sufficiently innocuous to \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, \nfinancial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could \nnot be used effectively to influence, manipulate , or pressure the individual,\u201d applies. \nUpon considering Applicant\u2019s relatives and Ghanaian property interests, together \nwith the geopolitical position of Ghana vis a vis the United States, and the length of time he \nhas been living in the United States, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign \ninfluence security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUpon considering the whole-person factors in my analysis of the facts, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She worked for the contractor from December 2022 until she was recently released from employment when her interim security clearance was withdrawn. Her former employer is still sponsoring her for a security clearance and will rehire her if she receives one. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. She has been married for more than 25 years, and she has four children between the ages of 18 and 24. (Items 4, 5) Applicant\u2019s husband owns a construction business. She helped him with the business, but she was not paid a salary or hourly wage, and she did not have another job for about 24 years until she accepted the job with the defense contractor in December 2022. Her husband\u2019s business had upturns and downturns. During one of the downturns from about 2017 to 2019, their income was considerably reduced.

She worked \nfor the contractor from December 2022 until she was recently released from \nemployment when her interim security clearance was withdrawn. Her former employer \nis still sponsoring her for a security clearance and will rehire her if she receives one. \nShe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. She has been married for more than 25 years, \nand she has four children between the ages of 18 and 24. (Items 4, 5) \nApplicant\u2019s husband owns a construction business. She helped him with the \nbusiness, but she was not paid a salary or hourly wage, and she did not have another \njob for about 24 years until she accepted the job with the defense contractor in \nDecember 2022. Her husband\u2019s business had upturns and downturns. During one of the \ndownturns from about 2017 to 2019, their income was considerably reduced.

After various credits, they received a \nrefund of $4,619. (Items 4, 5, 9; AE A) \nDuring the downturn. Applicant was unable to pay all her credit cards, and some \naccounts became delinquent. Her student loans were also reported as in default. She \nand her husband realized about $400,000 in profit from the sale of their home in March \n2021. They used some of the proceeds to pay off her credit cards. Her student loans \nwere paused and placed in good standing under the relief granted by the CARES Act. \nThey used much of the remaining proceeds from the sale toward the purchase and \nconstruction of a new home, which was also financed through a mortgage loan. The \nJanuary 2024 credit report lists a mortgage loan with a balance of $374,187. (Items 4-9) \nApplicant\u2019s husband managed the finances of his business, and he also handled \ntheir taxes and tax returns. Applicant did not realize that he did not pay their joint taxes. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes federal income taxes of $9,158 for tax year 2020 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); $8,854 for 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and of $20,334 for 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Those \namounts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and IRS records. (Items 4-6, 9) \nBecause Applicant\u2019s husband is self-employed, he does not have wages from \nwhich income taxes can be withheld. Because they file joint returns, he and Applicant \nare obligated to pay their own taxes and in certain situations, prepay their taxes. An IRS \naccount transcript for tax year 2020, obtained in December 2023, shows adjusted gross \nincome of $76,648 and taxable income of $41,478. The IRS did not receive a tax return \nuntil April 2022. They received certain credits, a payment of $100 was received in May \n2023, and estimated tax of $275 was transferred in this tax year in July 2023, but the \ntranscript does not show any other taxes paid.

The transcript does not show \nany other taxes paid. Penalties were levied for not prepaying tax, late payment of tax, \nand filing tax return after the due date. An installment agreement was established in \nAugust 2023. With penalties and interest, the balance was $20,334. (Items 4, 6) \nApplicant reported in her December 2022 Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) that her husband filed their 2020 and 2021 tax returns in 2022 and \nthey \u201cdo currently owe for those years.\u201d She was interviewed for her background \ninvestigation in March 2023.

She told the investigator that her husband told her that he \nwould make arrangements to make them current on their taxes. (Items 5, 9) \nApplicant responded to interrogatories in August 2023. She provided tax \ntranscripts and other tax information showing the installment agreements discussed \nabove. She wrote that they \u201chave a payment plan in place.\u201d (Item 6) \nApplicant provided documentation that her husband paid the IRS $1,411 in \nFebruary 2024. There is no evidence of any other payments between the establishment \nof the installment agreement and this payment. She or her husband talked to a \nrepresentative from the IRS on February 15, 2024. Their installment agreement for tax \nyears 2020 through 2022 was modified so that $555 would be deducted on the seventh \nof each month, starting on April 7, 2024. The IRS sent Applicant\u2019s husband a notice on \nMarch 4, 2024, that it intended to terminate his installment agreement because the IRS \ndid not receive one or more payments from him. The notice indicated that $555 was due \nimmediately. This notice may have been automatically generated and sent out without \nconsideration of the $1,411 payment and modified installment agreement in February \n2024. (Item 4; AE A-C) \nApplicant stated in her response to the FORM that she \u201chad no idea that the \noriginal [installment] plan was in default as that was an arrangement made by [her] \nhusband with the IRS and payments were to be debited from his acc[ount].\u201d She \nprovided documentation that she has been paying her student loans, with payments of \n$1,159; $380; $750; and $380 made between December 2023 and March 2024.

(AE A, D-F) \nApplicant assures that she is not a security risk, as her \u201cwork ethic, morals, and \npersonal values overshadow any debt that [she] may have.\u201d She believes the amount of \ntaxes owed is minimal in comparison to their more than $400,000 in equity in their \nhouse that is under construction.

She wrote that \u201cwhatever determination \nhas been made about my character based on owed taxes from my husband\u2019s income \n(which we have a payment plan for) is an insult to me and my family.\u201d (Item 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant and her husband did not pay their federal income taxes for tax years \n2020, 2021, and 2022. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant helped her husband with his construction business, but she was not \npaid a salary or hourly wage, and she did not have another job for about 24 years until \nshe accepted the job with the defense contractor in December 2022. Her husband\u2019s \nbusiness had upturns and downturns, as reflected in the account transcripts for tax \nyears 2018 and 2019. Their income increased in 2020 and 2021 and was sizeable in \n2022. They also profited $400,000 from the sale of their home in March 2021. They \nused some of that amount to pay credit card debts, and the rest toward their new home, \nbut nothing went to their taxes. Applicant let her husband manage their taxes. However, \nonce they filed joint returns, she accepted responsibility for their taxes. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018). \nExcept for the $2,775 that was withheld from Applicant\u2019s paycheck, she and her \nhusband paid almost nothing in actual taxes, prepaid or otherwise, for tax years 2020 \nthrough 2022. Because Applicant chose to forego a hearing, I was unable to evaluate \nher credibility or question her about the status of her 2023 taxes. In spite of those \nreservations, I would have given serious consideration to granting Applicant\u2019s clearance \nhad they maintained the payments under the installment agreement they entered in \nAugust 2023. As is, I am left with Applicant\u2019s statement that they intend to pay the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntaxes. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013).  \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that she will \nadhere to the new installment agreement and pay the past-due taxes. There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that her tax problems will be resolved within a \nreasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her taxes. Her financial issues \nare recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficiently \napplicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has unpaid taxes for three tax \nyears, and her payments toward those taxes were minimal. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will \nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d I am obligated to follow that directive. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On August 10, 2022, Department \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including evidentiary Items 1 to 8, was provided to Applicant, who \nreceived the FORM on October 12, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to raise objections and \nsubmit documents in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

He also wrote that his wife and daughter have had significant medical issues \nthat caused him to incur unexpected medical expenses. His medical insurance covers \nmuch, but not all, of those expenses. In addition, he explained that that the COVID-19 \npandemic prevented his wife from working because she has a compromised immune \nsystem due to the medications she takes for her medical condition. This has resulted in \na reduced family income available to pay their expenses. (Answer at 2.) \nIn the e-QIP and during his security interview, Applicant provided additional details \nof unexpected expenses he has incurred in recent years and other mitigating conditions. \nHis son with the addiction caused Applicant to pay restitution for money stolen by his son. \nThe son also had a DUI arrest, which caused Applicant to incur legal fees and court costs. \nApplicant also noted that he had unforeseen auto repairs and higher interest rates and \nlate fees due to late payments on his bills. Applicant also noted that he was laid off in \nDecember 2017 and, even though he immediately obtained a new position with his \ncurrent employer and clearance sponsor, he took a pay cut to remain employed.

Also, he provided no \ninformation detailing his plans for resolving his past-due indebtedness or demonstrating \nother indicia of trustworthiness. According to the available record information, Applicant \npurchased his residence in January 2008 and, as of the date of the e-QIP, April 16, 2018, \nhe continued to reside in that home. He provided no information regarding his equity in \nthe home or any plans to use that equity to resolve his debts. (Item 3 at Section 11.) \nIn his security interview, he made vague statements about working to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. He offered no specific steps he is taking to reduce his expenses or \notherwise enable him to repay his debts. He expressed no intention to work at a second, \nparttime job to repay his debts, or to seek a court-ordered, five-year repayment plan for \nall or part of his debts under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy reorganization plan. (Item 5 at 4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted that he incurred about $71,000 in past-due accounts over the \nlast several years. The 12 delinquent debts set forth in the SOR establish the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose under extraordinary circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur. The fact that he experienced the circumstances does not cast doubt on his reliability \nand trustworthiness. However, the fact that he has not addressed his delinquent debts \nover the past several years, even after his receipt of the SOR in March 2021, casts serious \ndoubts about his judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is only partially established. \nApplicant\u2019s dire financial position is the result of conditions that were largely \nbeyond his control. However, he has offered no evidence to support a conclusion that he \nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. He has not presented a reasonable plan \nto resolve his debts nor has he sought financial counseling to develop such a plan. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his past-due indebtedness. Also, he has not provided any \nwhole-person evidence regarding his trustworthiness or reliability. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance at the present time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official,\u2026 in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \nOn multiple occasions, Applicant deliberately falsified her 2016 SCA, 2018 \nbackground interviews, and her January 2020 response to interrogatories concerning \nher August 2014 employment suspension and subsequent job termination in September \n2014 by a government contractor. The Government provided clear and convincing \ndocuments in the record concerning this matter. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible. She continues to lie about the circumstances of the 2014 termination of her \nemployment with a former government contractor, despite the convincing evidence in \nthe record. She did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct omissions or \nfalsifications she provided during the course of the security clearance investigation, and \nshe failed to provide any corroborating evidence to support her claims. Her pattern of \ndishonesty casts doubt on her overall reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n \n Whole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \nprovides insight into Applicant\u2019s character and integrity. She is not remorseful for her \nmisconduct or deceit, and her explanations are self-serving and insincere. I conclude \nthat she has not mitigated security concerns raised by her personal conduct. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

She opined that he is a \u201c100% changed man.\u201d She \ncorroborated that, as of May 2023, he had been \u201ctotally free from alcohol and drama for \nmore than a year.\u201d She believed that he consumed alcohol \u201cto relax and relieve the stress\u201d \nassociated her medical diagnosis and several deaths in their families, including his father \nin 2006; his mother, her father, and her nephew in 2020; and his nephew in 2021.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG.

An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

The security significance \nof the 1991 offense is brought current by his more recent 2017 offense. In describing the \nfacts and circumstances underlying his arrests, Applicant minimized his alcohol \nconsumption and failed to fully accept responsibility for his wrongdoing. Notwithstanding \nhis assertions to the contrary, I find that each of the criminal charges resulted from his \nexcessive consumption of alcohol. \nI considered that six years have passed since he was last criminally charged, and \nthat he abstained from consuming alcohol from January 2022 through at least May 2023. \nHowever, the charges spanned a period of 26 years from 1991 (age 25) through 2017 \n(age 51), and each incident occurred while he was in possession of a security clearance. \nHis decision to drive after consuming alcohol in 2017 was particularly egregious given \nthat he crashed his vehicle and served jail time after drunk driving in 2013. He continued \nto consume alcohol while on probation for his 2017 charge. There has neither been a \nsufficient passage of time nor pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. Accordingly, I find that Applicant failed to \nmeet his burden to establish either AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) or 32(d). \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence concerning SOR \u00b6 2.c (which \ncross-alleged the facts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e) establish the following disqualifying \nconditions set forth in AG \u00b6 22 under this guideline: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \nBecause the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b refer to treatment without a \ndiagnosis, they do not independently establish any disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, \nI must find \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nand 2.b remain relevant to the underlying alcohol-related criminal charges to which they \nrelate and to the overall Guideline G concerns. \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 23 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following warrant discussion: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s five alcohol-related criminal offenses and history of excessive alcohol \nconsumption raise questions about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Although \nhe continued to drink to the point of intoxication as recently as January 2022, he now \nunderstands that he has a problem with alcohol and recognizes that he should not \nconsume alcohol. He abstained from consuming alcohol from January 2022 through at \nleast May 2023. While he appeared sincere in his commitment to maintain sobriety, there \nhas not been a sufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that his \nexcessive consumption of alcohol and questionable judgment are behind him. \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline J, I find that Applicant failed to meet his \nburden to establish either AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) or 23(b). \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and G in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to \nreport his arrests for fear of losing his job further weighs against mitigation. After \nconsidering the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and G, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant \nhas not mitigated security concerns raised by his criminal conduct and excessive alcohol \nconsumption. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 5-6) I wrote the \nrevisions on the file copy of the SOR. \nII. Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance Status \nA. Background \nCounsel for Applicant contends that Applicant was granted a clearance after a \nfavorable adjudication on November 3, 2020, and another favorable determination on \nSeptember 17, 2023. In support, he provided a copy of a memo from Applicant\u2019s sponsor. \n(AE G) Department Counsel argued that Applicant had not been granted a clearance since \n2009. I extended the record for resolution of this issue. \nDepartment Counsel provided printouts of the Defense Information System for \nSecurity (DISS) electronic case notes regarding Applicant. (GE 13-15) These notes \nestablish that Applicant\u2019s last grant of a clearance after a completed investigation was \n2009. (GE 13 at 1) In 2017, Applicant underwent a periodic reinvestigation, which was \nclosed after he was defaulted for not cooperating. (GE 3) In 2019, DOHA contacted \nApplicant and gave him an opportunity to reassess his previous decision not to cooperate. \n(GE 3) After Applicant agreed to cooperate, DOHA re-opened the investigation in \nNovember 2020. The re-opened investigation appeared in the database as a security \nclearance grant. (GE 13 at 2) Similarly, after his investigation was closed for loss of \njurisdiction when his employer stopped sponsoring him, and picked up again after another \nemployer sponsored him, the database noted his clearance status as granted again as of \n2020. (GE 14 at 1) \nAttorney for Applicant contended there were inconsistencies and mistakes in the \nportion of DISS\u2019 file, as included in GE 13 to GE 15, and requested that I \u201ccompel \ndisclosure of the relevant portion of DISS which materially supports Applicant\u2019s belief that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe has been adjudicated favorably for a clearance.\u201d (AE H) Although DOHA lacks \nsubpoena power, administrative judges can at their discretion order DOHA to obtain \ndocuments subject to its control. (E3.1.10; E3.1.11) As Department Counsel supplemented \nthe record with documents obtained from DISS, such records are clearly subject to DOHA\u2019s \ncontrol. However, requesting DOHA to obtain a portion of a record from DISS that possibly \nmay support a position asserted by Applicant is irrelevant due to the current posture of the \ncase because even if he was granted a security clearance previously, DCIS CAS and \nDOHA have jurisdiction to consider or reconsider his security clearance now. \nConsequently, I deny Applicant\u2019s motion to compel production of additional records from \nDISS, and I conclude based upon the record, as supplemented by Department Counsel, \nthat I have jurisdiction to adjudicate this case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old married man with two adult children. He has been married \nto his current wife since 2015. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 2013. (GE 1 at 43-\n44) Applicant earned a high school diploma in 1986 and an associate degree in 2006. (GE \n1 at 15) \nApplicant is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, serving from 1986 to 1990. (Tr. 27) \nHe was discharged honorably. After leaving the Marines, he joined the U.S. State \nDepartment as a security officer until 1992. (Tr. 28) That year, he joined the U.S. Border \nPatrol where he worked until his retirement in 2019. (Tr. 33) While with the Border Patrol, \nhe spearheaded an interrogation technique which over the years has become a national \nmodel. (Tr. 30) Since retiring, Applicant has been working abroad for a contractor \nperforming technical service work on non-intrusive inspection systems. (Tr. 53) Since \nworking at his current job, he has received excellent performance ratings. (GE 8 at 11) \nIn 2006, Applicant, while not on duty or in his work uniform, entered a grocery in a \nrural part of the country to buy beer. Although Applicant had no hard evidence of any \nwrongdoing, he began questioning the grocery store clerk about his immigration status, his \nforeign accent, and why he was living in that part of the country. (GE 8 at 21) These \nquestions angered the clerk, prompting him to ask Applicant to leave the store. While this \nexchange was occurring, another store patron called the police. (GE 8 at 22) During the \ntense exchange of words, Applicant followed the clerk behind the counter and put his \nhands on him. The clerk then fell down, whereupon Applicant pulled his service weapon \nand pointed it at the clerk, claiming that the clerk had lunged for one of the knives on the \ncounter. (GE 8 at 22) One of the store patrons then stepped between Applicant and the \nclerk, prompting Applicant to place his weapon back in the holster. (GE 14 at 23) \nThis episode led to an agency investigation. The investigation revealed that after the \nepisode Applicant had run queries on himself and the grocery store clerk in the Border \nPatrol database without authorization. (GE 8 at 14, 23) When confronted about the misuse \nof the database, Applicant offered conflicting stories.

It charged Applicant with conduct unbecoming a border patrol \nagent, lack of candor, and misuse of the database system, and it recommended his \ntermination. (GE 8 at 15) \nThe first-level reviewing authority sustained the recommendation for termination. \n(GE 8 at 15) On appeal, an arbitrator sustained the charges of conduct unbecoming a \nborder patrol agent and misuse of the database, and lack of candor with respect to \nquestions about the database. In doing so, the hearing officer concluded that Applicant \n\u201chad no operational reason [for initiating] a volatile and dangerous altercation.\u201d (GE 6 at 14) \nHowever, he concluded that removal was not a reasonable remedy. (GE 8 at 24) Instead, \nthe reviewing authority reduced the punishment to suspension of 180 days with restoration \nof payment that had been stopped after the termination. (GE 8 at 25-27) \nIn March 2010, Applicant while driving his marked Border Patrol vehicle, called local \npolice to ask if they had a unit in his location because the motorist behind him was riding \nhis bumper while traveling 80 miles per hour. (GE 8 at 31) He told the police dispatcher that \nhe wanted to pull the driver over and \u201cchew her tail out,\u201d and the dispatcher approved. (GE \n8 at 32) He then pulled the driver over. Immediately after the stop, the driver called Border \nPatrol and reported that Applicant was rude, irate, and made her fear for her safety. (GE 8 \nat 32) Later that month, Applicant pulled over a Latino motorist whom he suspected was an \nillegal alien. (GE 8 at 34) After questioning him, Applicant released him, concluding that he \nhad no authority to interrogate him further. (GE 8 at 30) Applicant\u2019s employer, however, \nreprimanded him for not making a warrantless arrest, not asking the man for his name or \ndriver\u2019s license, and not promptly reporting the investigative stop to Applicant\u2019s chain of \ncommand. (GE 8 at 30) \nLater that year, the agency considered the motorist\u2019s complaint, and the unrelated \nincident involving his release of the Latino driver without more intensive interrogation, and \ncharged Applicant with unprofessional conduct, consequently removing him from \nemployment, effective March 2011. (GE 8 at 28) On appeal, the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard (MSPB) , in April 2012, sustained the charge of unprofessional conduct, with respect \nto the episode with the female driver, but characterized it as \u201ca relatively minor infraction,\u201d \nand reduced the punishment from termination to a 14-day suspension without pay, credited \nfrom the pay he did not receive while the appeal was pending. (GE 8 at 33-34) In addition, \nthe MSPB concluded the charge involving the Latino motorist was not sustained. (GE 8 at \n31) \nOn November 2, 2012, Applicant was charged with failure to exercise due caution in \nthe operation of a government-owned vehicle after accidentally backing his assigned \nvehicle into a tree while exiting a parking lot. (GE 8 at 91) On November 29, 2012, \nApplicant while on duty and in uniform went into a gun shop for personal reasons, and \nwhile inside the store questioned a customer, an Asian-American, about his immigration \nstatus. (GE 8 at 91) He allegedly followed the person around the store for a half an hour. \n(GE 8 at 91) Subsequently on December 26, 2013, the agency charged him with failure to \nexercise due caution for the car incident, conduct unbecoming an officer for the gun store \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincident, as well as lack of candor, and misuse of information systems for two related \nmatters, and fired him. (GE 8 at 91) \nApplicant subsequently filed a grievance. (GE 4 at 6) At arbitration, Applicant\u2019s \nattorney characterized the proceedings as a witch hunt. The arbitrator agreed, emphatically \nrejecting the agency\u2019s case, noting in his decision that Applicant\u2019s employer was \u201cout to get \n[him] no matter what.\u201d (GE 8 at 123) Moreover, the arbitrator concluded that the agency\u2019s \nincident report of the gun shop episode was exaggerated, admonishing Applicant\u2019s \nemployer that \u201chyperboles, particularly when not verified, do nothing more than present a \ntainted picture of the event and inflame management\u2019s perception.\u201d (GE 3 at 118) \nUltimately on June 12, 2015, the arbitrator dismissed all the charges other than the one \ninvolving the accident with the government-owned vehicle and reduced the penalty from \nremoval to a 30-day suspension. (GE 8 at 125). Applicant was on paid administrative leave \nfor six months while this case was being adjudicated. (GE 4 at 6) \nIn 2011, Applicant was selected to work as a lead advisor on border patrol control \nissues in a combat zone abroad. (Tr. 35) He worked at this assignment through 2012. In \n2016, Applicant was promoted to the position of temporary supervisor. (Tr. 59) His duties \nincluded training other agents on how to properly conduct investigations. (Tr. 31) He retired \nin 2018. (Tr. 31) Between 1996 to 2005, all of Applicant\u2019s performance ratings were \noutstanding. (GE 8 at 101) In 2006, the Border Patrol agency\u2019s evaluation system changed \nto \u201cPass/Fail.\u201d From 2006 to 2018 when Applicant retired, he received passing evaluations. \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s current team leader for the past year, he is \u201ca vital part of \n[their] day-to-day operation,\u201d and he has never had any reason to question his integrity or \nwork ethic since Applicant has been working for him. (AE D) \nDuring the beginning of a security clearance interview in July 2017, Applicant \nrefused to provide full and frank answers to questions. Instead, he referred the agent to his \nattorney and repeatedly interrupted her. (Tr. 45-46) He did not want to talk about the issues \ninvolving past termination decisions because each decision had been reversed. (GE 4 at 6) \nOn July 12, 2017, he sent 16 unsolicited text messages to the investigator, contending that \nthe investigation had \u201ccrossed the civil liability line,\u201d and threatening litigation. (Answer at 2) \nApplicant contends that he sent these texts out of frustration with the process. (Answer at \n2) \nIn July 2019, the DCSA CAS contacted Applicant, explained the information \nrequested was relevant and material to his security clearance determination, and gave him \nanother opportunity to cooperate with the investigation, warning that continued failure \nwould result in discontinuation of his case. (GE 3 at 1) On December 2019, Applicant \ncompleted an affidavit setting forth his intention to fully discuss the relevant information with \nthe investigator. On January 2020, he again contacted DCSA CAS, apologized for the \nlengthy delay in responding and explained that he did not think there was any just cause to \ndiscuss his past terminations since he had been reinstated after each termination. (GE 4 at \n8) In February 2021, Applicant answered another set of interrogatories. He provided \ncomprehensive interrogatory responses with multiple documents attached.

(GE 12) \nIn 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer transferred him to another part of the country. His wife \nstayed in their home with the children, refusing to move. For the next eight years, Applicant \nsupported two households. (Tr. 120) As the only breadwinner, Applicant\u2019s finances became \nstrained, and he gradually became reliant upon credit cards to pay bills. (Tr. 59) In addition, \nApplicant\u2019s marriage deteriorated, leading to a divorce in 2013. (Tr. 59) \nIn February 2018, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (GE 9) He converted \nthis bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2018. The amount discharged is \nunclear from the record. \nApplicant did not file his federal income tax returns for 2018 and 2019 until August \n2022. (AE C at 3) According to a certified tax preparer whom he retained in 2019, and who \ntestified, the delay occurred because of the length of time that it took to obtain an individual \ntax identification number (ITIN) for his current wife, a citizen and resident of Kuwait who \nwas in the process of becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen during this time. (See foreign \ninfluence section of Decision, infra). (Tr. 133, 135) Applicant has filed his 2018 tax return, \nand is due a refund of $3,102 and he filed his 2019 federal tax bill and paid the amount \ndue, totaling $459. (GE C at 2; Tr. 70) \nApplicant owes tax delinquencies for tax year 2014 and tax year 2015. (AE A at 2-4; \nGE 7 at 3) These debts were triggered after an audit of these tax years concluded that he \nerroneously claimed the foreign income exemption on his tax returns. (Tr. 90) When the \nIRS initially recalculated the tax debt, it concluded that Applicant owed an additional \n$40,000 for tax years 2014 and 2015. (Tr. 90) Applicant appealed this decision to a tax \ncourt, arguing that the foreign earned income exclusion applied because he worked abroad \nfor both of those tax years. (Tr. 89; GE 1 at 19) Although he lost the appeal, he successfully \nnegotiated a reduction in the balance. (AE A at 2-4) Currently, he owes $4,529 for tax year \n2014 and $15,924 for tax year 2015. (AE A at 2-4) \nThree weeks before the hearing, Applicant made two payments totaling $500 \ntowards the reduction of the tax delinquency. (Tr. 90; AE B at 1) In 2020, Applicant retained \nhis current tax preparer. (AE H, Attachment (Att.) B at 3) With the tax preparer\u2019s help, he \namended the 2014 and 2015 tax return, Also, the tax preparer helped him with his 2018 \nand 2019 tax returns to account the ITIN request for Applicant\u2019s spouse. (AE H, Att. B at 3) \nThe tax preparer attributes the delays in resolving the tax issues to incorrect information \nregarding Applicant\u2019s employment and income, and correspondence delays that were \nexacerbated by the pandemic. (Tr. 111) With the tax preparer\u2019s assistance, Applicant \nrequested and was approved for the IRS Combat Zone exemption, which was extended to \ncivilians working in combat zones as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the Act). \n(AE H, Att.

Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance,\nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nApplicant\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the investigative agent triggers the application \nof the following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 15: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate with \nsecurity processing, including, but not limited to meeting with a security \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required, and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in connection \nwith a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s history of work-related misconduct generates the \nfollowing disqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information [including] \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliability behavior . . . [and] \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . . \nApplicant\u2019s most serious episode of workplace misconduct, as set forth in \nsubparagraph 1.a(1), occurred more than 15 years ago. As for the pulling over the motorist \nand \u201cchewing her tail out,\u201d as set forth in subparagraph 1.a(2), I agree with the MSPB\u2019s \nconclusion that it was a minor infraction. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s decision not to detain a \ndriver based on his belief that he could not do so solely because of his ethnicity, not only \ndid not constitute unprofessional conduct, as the MSPB concluded; it reflected favorably \nupon his judgment with respect to the ISCR analysis. Lastly, the reprimand for backing his \ncar into a tree, as alleged in subparagraph 1.a(3), was minor and occurred nearly ten years \nago. \nIn 2016, approximately three years after the most recent allegation of workplace \nmisconduct, Applicant was promoted. His duties included training other border patrol \nagents how to properly conduct investigations. He worked in this position through his \nretirement in 2018. Currently, Applicant\u2019s work performance is good. \nIn sum, I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.a in favor of \nApplicant. \nCooperation with the investigative process is so important that the consequences for \nfailure to cooperate are set forth in \u00b6 6.2 of the Directive and reiterated in the introductory \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsection of the personal conduct adjudicative guideline. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 15(a) and 15(b)) Neither \nApplicant\u2019s frustration with the investigative process nor his belief that OPM was estopped \nfrom asking about past derogatory employment information that had been resolved in his \nfavor justified his failure to answer questions about these issues in 2017. Moreover, this \nwas not the first time he had refused to answer questions from an investigator, as he had \ndone so during an earlier investigation in 2002. Applicants cannot decide with impunity \nwhat questions they will or will not answer. Applicant deserves credit for eventually \ncooperating when admonished about the consequences of his continued refusal. However, \ngiven the recurrent nature of this behavior, I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions \napply, and that his refusal to cooperate continues to pose a security concern. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nApplicant filed his 2018 federal tax return and is owed a refund. I conclude that his \nlate filing does not generate a security concern. I resolve SOR subparagraph 3.b in his \nfavor. \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge and his outstanding, delinquent \nfederal income tax debts trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income tax returns, or failure to pay annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were unrelated to any foolish or profligate spending. \nInstead, they were caused by a 2013 divorce, and the years of separation preceding the \ndivorce when Applicant was supporting two households.

Applicant successfully obtained a \nbankruptcy discharge in 2018 and he has been working with a certified tax preparer who \nhelped him amend his 2014 and 2015 tax returns. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies. \nApplicant is not currently making payments to resolve his IRS tax delinquency. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(g) do not apply. Conversely, according to Applicant\u2019s tax preparer, he \ndoes not have to make any payments at this time because he successfully applied for the \nIRS combat zone exemption. (AE H Att. B at 2) Given the applicability of this exemption, all \nof Applicant\u2019s tax liabilities, fees, and interest are suspended so long as he remains in the \ncombat zone, and Applicant will have 180 days to settle all outstanding tax issues after he \nleaves the combat zone. (AE H Att. B at 2) \nApplicant incurred the 2014 and 2015 tax delinquencies because of a good-faith \nmisinterpretation of the tax code regarding the applicability of the foreign income exclusion. \nAfter the audit revealed his mistake and that he owed $40,000, he appealed the decision to \nthe tax court and obtained a reduction in the debt to approximately $20,000. He has been \nworking with a certified tax preparer for the past three years to help him resolve the tax \ncontroversy. Applicant certainly could have made more progress in paying down the tax \ndelinquency over the years. Currently, however, he is clearly engaged in the process of \naddressing them. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nForeign Influence \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial and property interests, are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiance.\u201d Applicant does not interact with his brother-in-law and one of his \nsisters-in-law. Under these circumstances, these relationships do not pose a security \nconcern. I resolve SOR subparagraph 2.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nKuwait is an ally of the United States and is a critical partner in counterterrorism \nefforts. None of the administrative notice documents contained any derogatory information \nabout Kuwait\u2019s relationship with the United States. Conversely, whether a country is friendly \nwith the United States is noteworthy but is not dispositive as to whether there is any \nvulnerability to coercion, as friendly countries have been known to conduct economic \nespionage. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion is heightened because he lives \nin Kuwait, and his wife is a senior official of a Kuwaiti government agency. Under these \ncircumstances, under AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family \nmember, business, or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s relationship to his \nwife and two of his sister in-laws, and AG \u00b6 7(e) shared living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies to his relationship with his \nwife. \nOf the two sisters with whom Applicant is in touch, he is in contact with them, but he \nhe does not like them. Under these circumstances, the frequency of the contact renders AG \n\u00b6 8(c), contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there \nis little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d inapplicable, \nbut the lack of feelings or affection for these in-laws mitigates the security concern. \nThe job position of Applicant\u2019s wife, together with the fact they reside in Kuwait \ngenerates a security concern too significant to overcome. Because there is a rebuttable \npresumption that he has close ties of affection to his mother-in-law through his wife. (ISCR \nCase No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 3, 2008)), I conclude that this relationship remains \na security concern, as well. In reaching this conclusion, I did not apply AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019 sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest,\u201d because I could not resolve doubt about his decision-making generated by his \ntemperament and his recurrent history of refusing to cooperate with investigative \nauthorities. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUpon considering this case in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a(1)- 1.a(3): \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c \u2013 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 47, is self-employed as a consultant. He requires a security clearance for a project with a federal contractor. He was previously granted access to classified information by other federal agencies. He completed a security clearance application in January 2018, disclosing that he was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in November 2014 and August 2017. Applicant\u2019s background investigation revealed another DUI arrest in May 2019 as well as several delinquent debts. (Tr. 53; GE 1-9) Alcohol Concerns Applicant was born with a benign medical condition that has physical manifestations. Although the condition is not neurological, he has experienced issues in the workplace where his medical condition has made others uncomfortable and unnecessarily concerned about his health or ability to complete his job. In social settings, he had concerns that his medical condition would be off-putting to those who were unfamiliar with it. He tried medications in the past, but ultimately decided against pharmaceutical treatment, citing marginal improvement and negative side effects. He testified that his treating physician recommended one alcoholic beverage before certain events to lessen the appearance of the condition.

Applicant has a history \nof problematic alcohol use as evidenced by three convictions for driving under the \ninfluence in 2014, 2017, and 2019. Although the record contains some evidence in \nmitigation it is not enough to overcome Applicant\u2019s inability to acknowledge his level of \nintoxication during his 2014 and 2017 arrests. His failure to do so indicates a continued \nminimization of the severity of his history of alcohol consumption. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 3, 2020, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and financial \nconsiderations guidelines. This action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information, implemented on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \na determination whether to grant his security clearance. Applicant timely answered the \nSOR and a requested hearing. \nThe hearing convened on March 5, 2022. I appended to the record as Hearing \nExhibits (HE) I through III, respectively: (I) the Pre-Hearing Order, dated April 22, 2022; \n(II) the Government\u2019s Disclosure Letter, dated April 4, 2021; and, (III) Applicant\u2019s request \nfor administrative notice.

DOHA received the transcript on \nMay 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 47, is self-employed as a consultant. He requires a security clearance \nfor a project with a federal contractor. He was previously granted access to classified \ninformation by other federal agencies. He completed a security clearance application in \nJanuary 2018, disclosing that he was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) of \nalcohol in November 2014 and August 2017. Applicant\u2019s background investigation \nrevealed another DUI arrest in May 2019 as well as several delinquent debts. (Tr. 53; \nGE 1-9) \n Alcohol Concerns \nApplicant was born with a benign medical condition that has physical \nmanifestations. Although the condition is not neurological, he has experienced issues in \nthe workplace where his medical condition has made others uncomfortable and \nunnecessarily concerned about his health or ability to complete his job. In social settings, \nhe had concerns that his medical condition would be off-putting to those who were \nunfamiliar with it. He tried medications in the past, but ultimately decided against \npharmaceutical treatment, citing marginal improvement and negative side effects. He \ntestified that his treating physician recommended one alcoholic beverage before certain \nevents to lessen the appearance of the condition. Applicant submitted a peer-reviewed \narticle on the issue, which is appended to the record as HE III. However, he did not \nprovide a letter from his physician corroborating the recommendation. (Tr. 54-56, 80-81) \nApplicant is a competitive athlete. He attends training classes each week and \nparticipates in private training. He also practices at social events, usually held at local \nbars. Concerned that the his medical condition would inhibit his ability to interact with \nstrangers, he decided to try using alcohol before social practice events to reduce the \nappearance of his medical condition. He would not consume alcohol before work, a \ncompetition, or a formal training session. In those circumstances, the environments \nallowed him to communicate easily about his medical condition. However, the loud \nenvironment at social practice events prevented similar conversation. He testified that he \nwould typically have one or two drinks at the beginning of the evening. These events \ncould last more than five hours, and he would often attend more than one event on a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngiven evening. Outside of these events, Applicant described himself as an occasional \ndrinker, who did not regularly consume alcohol to intoxication. (Tr. 60-61, 76, 111-112, \n138-139) \nApplicant\u2019s first DUI arrest occurred in October 2014. He was on his way home \nafter a social practice event at a bar. He was pulled over for speeding. During the traffic \nstop, he provided a breath sample. He was arrested and charged with reckless driving for \ngoing 20 miles per hour over the speed limit and DUI \u2013 blood alcohol level .15% - .20%. \nHe admitted that he consumed one shot at the end of the night before driving home. He \ndoes not remember if he consumed another drink earlier in the evening. He does not \nbelieve that he was intoxicated and attributes his blood-alcohol level to the timing of the \nshot in relation to the breathalyzer test. In November 2014, he pleaded guilty to the DUI \ncharge and was sentenced to 180 days in jail with 175 days suspended. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was restricted for 12 months, and he was required to install an interlock device on \nhis car. He was also required to attend an alcohol education class. The speeding charge \nwas not prosecuted. He completed the terms of his sentence. He abstained from alcohol \nuntil at least November 2015, one year after the conviction. (Tr. 58-60, 112-117; GE 7) \nApplicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in February 2017. \nApplicant testified that he was at a social practice event and had one alcoholic drink \naround five or six o\u2019clock in the evening. On his way home around three o\u2019clock in the \nmorning, he swerved his car to avoid hitting a deer in the road. In avoiding the deer, he \nhit a curb. After the incident, Applicant felt that his car was not driving as smoothly, but it \nwas not enough to stop him from operating the vehicle. Instead of taking his intended exit, \nhe mistakenly ended up on the airport access road. The access road, which is almost 14 \nmiles long, does not have any exits to local-area traffic. Applicant drove the entire west-\nbound length of the road and circled the airport to access the local-area exits available \nfrom the east-bound lanes. As he was rounding the airport, an airport employee observed \nsparks coming from the bottom of the car and alerted the police, which issued a \u2018be on \nthe lookout\u2019 alert for Applicant\u2019s car. (Tr. 63-64, 117-120, 136, 146-148; GE 5-6) \nAs Applicant drove east bound on the airport access road, he passed a patrol car. \nThe police officer observed Applicant\u2019s car was producing smoke, heavy sparks, and was \nmissing two tires, causing him to drive on the remaining rims. When the officer pulled \nApplicant over, the officer noticed that Applicant smelled of alcohol and that his eyes \nappeared glassy. The officer also observed that Applicant was wet and appeared to have \nurinated on himself. Applicant admitted to the officer that he had one drink between nine \nand ten o\u2019clock p.m. The officer asked Applicant if he was aware of the damage to the \ncar, which, in addition to the two missing tires, also included a shattered rear window. \nApplicant told the officer he was unaware of the damage. Applicant agreed to submit to \nfield sobriety tests. He failed the test involving physical movements as well as the mental \nacuity tests. Applicant agreed to submit a breath sample, which yielded a .16% blood \nalcohol level. He was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) \u2013 second offense. At the \npolice station, Applicant was asked to provide another breath sample. The officer believed \nthat Applicant intentionally failed to follow directions for completing the test and charged \nhim with a civil violation for refusal of breath exam.

He denies that he submitted a breath \nsample during the traffic stop. He claims that he was given field sobriety tests, which he \ncould not execute due to his medical condition. He also testified that he had not urinated \non himself but was still sweating as his body cooled from the physical activity of the \nevening. He explained that he was asked to provide a second breath sample at the police \nstation and that the results were inconclusive. However, he is adamant that he was not \nintoxicated. (Tr. 64-68, 123; GE 5-6) \nAlthough Applicant was initially charged with DWI \u2013 second offense, the charge \nwas reduced to DWI \u2013 first offense. Taking his lawyer\u2019s advice, Applicant pleaded guilty \nin August 2017. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail with 175 days suspended. The court \nrestricted his license for 12 months and required him to install an interlock device on his \ncar. He was also required to attend an alcohol education class. The civil violation was \nnolle prossed. He completed the terms of his sentence and abstained from alcohol until \napproximately August 2018, one year after the conviction. (Tr. 61-62, 68-69, 127-129; GE \n5-6) \nApplicant disputes the accuracy of the field breathalyzer test results for his 2014 \nand 2017 arrests. He maintains that he was not intoxicated during either stop. To support \nhis concern about the inaccuracy of the tests, he submitted a newspaper article on the \nissue. However, it does not appear that he challenged the accuracy of either reading in \ncourt. (HE III) \nTen months after having the restrictions on his driver\u2019s license lifted, Applicant was \narrested for his third alcohol-related arrest May 2019. Applicant was at another social \npractice event at a bar close to his home. In celebration of his upcoming birthday, his \nfriends bought him several rounds of drinks. He admits that he was intoxicated and that \nhe chose to drive home. A police officer initiated a traffic stop after observing Applicant \ndriving erratically, swerving off the road and almost hitting a barrier. Upon approaching \nthe car, the officer observed that Applicant smelled of alcohol and that he had vomited \ninside the car. Applicant admitted that he had been drinking and had consumed too much \nalcohol but could not state how much he had to drink.  He was arrested for DUI. (Tr. 69-\n70, 76, 133-134; GE 3-4) \nApplicant was charged with felony DWI \u2013 third. He pleaded guilty in August 2020. \nHe was sentenced to two years\u2019 incarceration, with one year and nine months suspended. \nBecause of concerns related to the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the incarcerated \npopulation in his state, Applicant was able to serve his sentence on home confinement. \nHis license was suspended indefinitely. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 supervised \nprobation. Initially, he was required to check in in-person with his probation officer, but in \nAugust 2022 he was granted permission to check in using a mobile application. \nApplicant\u2019s probation expired in December 2022. He is eligible to apply for a restricted \nlicense in 2023 and for the reinstatement of his driving privileges in 2025. (Tr. 71, 135-\n137; GE 3-4; Ans, Enclosures 6-7) \nApplicant\u2019s friend, Witness 1, testified at the hearing.

He picked Applicant up from jail after the 2014 arrest and \nspoke to him immediately after the 2017 arrest. The night of the 2019 arrest, Witness 1, \npicked Applicant up from the police station, took him home, and at Applicant\u2019s request, \nremoved all the alcohol from Applicant\u2019s home. Since that night, he has not seen Applicant \nconsume alcohol in any social setting. Witness 1 also has a professional relationship with \nApplicant, whom he has hired as contractor for the business he owns. He has no concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness. He considers Applicant to be a reliable \nand trustworthy professional. (Tr. 19-35) \nApplicant still attends social practice events, but he no longer consumes alcohol. \nAlthough his medical condition will intensify with age, Applicant realized that it does not \naffect his ability to participate comfortably. He realized that the underlying issue was his \nembarrassment about his medical condition. He has gotten more comfortable with \ndiscussing the issue in personal and social settings. He has informed the bartenders at \nthe events he frequents that he no longer drinks alcohol, and he supports them by tipping \non the non-alcoholic drinks he purchases. (Tr. 39-42, 45-50, 57, 60-61, 78-79, 80) \nAs of the hearing, Applicant had abstained from alcohol for 1,075 days, almost \nthree years. His main tool is a manual counter that tracks the number of days that he has \nabstained from alcohol. He finds the satisfaction of watching the counter turn over as \nsignificant motivation. He does not participate in any sobriety management program. Nor \ndid he report attending therapy. He has increased his participation in his sport, entering \ncompetitions with his girlfriend of two years. She also testified at the hearing. She is aware \nof his history of DUIs and his probationary status. They spend their time together in \ncouples\u2019 and individual training classes and practicing for competitions. Neither \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend nor his friend have seen Applicant consume any alcohol since May \n2019. (Tr. 39-42, 45-50, 57, 73-74; Answer, Enclosure 9) \nFinancial Issues \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant is indebted to 5 creditors for $28,713. The \nSOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mortgage is delinquent (SOR \u00b6 3.a, $11,823). However, this \nappears to be a reporting error due to the transfer of the mortgage from one servicer to \nanother. Applicant provided documentation that his mortgage is current and paid on time. \nHis April 2022 credit report correctly reports the account as being transferred to another \nlender, and the new servicer reports the account is current and in good standing. He has \ndisputed the derogatory information with the credit reporting agencies and the dispute \nwas resolved in his favor. (Tr. 82-84; AE A; Ans, Enclosure 10) \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b ($11,340) and 3.e ($3,300) were debts incurred \nduring his marriage, which ended in divorce in 2014. His ex-wife was a spendthrift and \nincurred significant debt using their joint credit cards. Although the marriage ended \nbecause of his ex-wife\u2019s infidelity during the marriage, Applicant assumed responsibility \nfor the marital debts during the divorce. He resolved SOR \u00b6 3.b in June 2020. He also \nresolved the account in SOR \u00b6 3.e and it is no longer being reported on his most recent \ncredit report.

He currently earns approximately $125,000 \nannually. He lives within his means. He owns his home and has other assets. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness. The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case. \nBetween 2014 and 2020, Applicant was arrested for and convicted of three alcohol-\nrelated driving offenses. The last conviction, a felony, resulted in Applicant being placed \non home confinement for three months and supervised probation for 2 years, which \nexpired in December 2022. The record establishes that he has a maladaptive relationship \nwith alcohol. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 22(a), alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnoses with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c), habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder.  \nThe record also contains mitigating evidence. Of the alcohol consumption \nmitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 23(b) partially applies: \nThe individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, \nprovides evidence of action taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nThe record contains some mitigating evidence. Applicant has not been diagnosed \nwith an alcohol use disorder. Nor has he been advised by his physician or a substance-\nabuse counselor to abstain from alcohol, though he has decided for himself to do so. At \nthe time of the hearing, he had abstained from alcohol for almost three years. He has \nincreased his involvement in a sporting activity. Although he continues to attend social \npractice events at bars, he has informed the bartenders of his decision to abstain from \nalcohol. He no longer keeps alcohol in his home. \nApplicant began consuming alcohol as an unconventional method of diminishing \nthe appearance of a medical condition in social settings. At the time he chose to do so, \nhe was in early middle age and had lived with his medical conditional since birth. He \nadmitted that his medical condition sometimes served as a source of embarrassment for \nhim. In addition to using the alcohol to lessen the appearance of his medical condition, it \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseems that he also used alcohol to self-medicate his feelings of embarrassment in social \nsettings. Although Applicant testified at hearing that his embarrassment is no longer an \nissue and therefore eliminates his need to consume alcohol, he did not explain what steps \nhe took to resolve the issue. He did not offer any testimony on how he will manage any \nnegative feelings arising from his medical condition, which will only intensify in \nappearance over time, if negative feelings arise in the future. He is not in therapy to \naddress the underlying issue and he has decided against pharmaceutical treatment for \nthe medical condition. Without a stated method of support for this ongoing issue, it is \npossible that Applicant may seek to self-medicate in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s inability to admit that he was intoxicated at the time of his 2014 and \n2017 arrests is problematic. Although Applicant maintains that he was not intoxicated for \neither of the 2014 or 2017 arrests, his testimony is not credible. On both occasions, he \nwas charged with having a blood alcohol level at least twice the legal limit. Furthermore, \nthe details in the 2017 police report do not describe a sober driver. It is unlikely that a \nsober driver would have been unaware that they were driving on two rims, with a broken \nwindow, and sparks emitting from the bottom of their vehicle. It is also unlikely that a sober \ndriver would have continued driving any vehicle in that condition. It is more likely than not \nthat Applicant was, in fact, intoxicated. His failure to acknowledge his level of intoxication \nduring these two events, indicates a minimization of the incidents, and the level of danger \nApplicant presented to himself as well as other drivers. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s third \nDWI offense occurred after completing a security clearance application. As a previous \nclearance holder, Applicant should have been aware of the investigation process and the \nresulting scrutiny on one\u2019s on and off-duty behavior. Despite this, Applicant engaged in \nillegal behavior that shows not only questionable judgment, but a continued issue with \nimpulse control.  \nCriminal Conduct \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant was convicted of three alcohol-\nrelated crimes between 2014 and 2020. The most recent of which resulted in his being \non probation until December 2022. His license has been suspended indefinitely. \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(a) applies: \nA pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nThe following criminal conduct mitigating condition is partially applicable: \nAG 32(d) there is successful evidence of rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to the passage of time with recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \np \nThe mitigating evidence applicable to the alcohol consumption concern is also \napplicable under the criminal conduct guideline. In addition, Applicant\u2019s last incident of \ncriminal conduct occurred almost four years ago. He completed the terms of his sentence \nand was released from probation without incident. However, this is not sufficient to \nmitigate the criminal conduct concerns. Applicant is a convicted felon. After pleaded guilty \nto two DUI offenses in three years, Applicant knew or should have known the potential of \nbeing charged with a felony for a third DUI offense. Despite the possibility of more severe \ncriminal penalties, Applicant was charged with his third DUI offense less than 10 months \nafter his driving restrictions were reinstated after his 2017 conviction. \nGiven his past behavior, the restrictions imposed by the state, in particular the loss \nof Applicant\u2019s driving privileges, prevent a finding of full successful rehabilitation. The \nconsequences of a fourth DUI conviction, which could result in incarceration in a state \npenitentiary, is a strong deterrent. However, it unclear if the passage of time without a \nrecurrence of alcohol-related criminal activity is related to changes Applicant has made \nin his life to support rehabilitation or the restrictions imposed on him by the state. The \ncriminal conduct concern is not mitigated. \nFinancial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $28,713 in \ndelinquent debt, including having a delinquent mortgage. He denies the allegations; \nhowever, the credit reports in the record support the allegations, which is sufficient to \napply AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nHe presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations concerns. \nThe alleged accounts are not indicative of financial problems or fiscal irresponsibility. He \nis financially stable and lives within his means. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3(a) and (c) \nare the result of errant reporting by the credit bureaus. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3(b) \nand (e) are by-products of his 2014 divorce and have been resolved. The remaining debt \nSOR \u00b6 3(d) for a medical debt, while unresolved, is immaterial to a determination of \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness. The following financial considerations mitigating \nconditions apply: \n20(b) conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibility under the circumstances; \n20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve the issue. \nWhole-Person Concept \nAfter reviewing the record and considering Applicant\u2019s testimony, doubts about his \nongoing security worthiness remain. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered \nthe whole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although Applicant had made some changes to \nhis life to support abstinence, it is not enough to mitigate the concerns about his \nrelationship with alcohol.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption:  \nAGINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs, 3.a \u2013 3.e  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",
