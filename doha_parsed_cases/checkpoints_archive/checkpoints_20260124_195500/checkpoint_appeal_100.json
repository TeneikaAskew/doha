Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAnthony J. Kuhn, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 20, 2017, DOD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C\n(Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 12, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by\nconcluding that the Government failed to establish a case of heightened risk under Disqualifying\nCondition 7(a)1 and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The\nJudge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline C have not been raised as an issue on appeal.  For the\nfollowing reasons, the Board remands the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance determination.\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in mid-50s, was born in the United Kingdom (U.K.), graduated from a\nmilitary academy, held a British security clearance, and retired as a British military officer after\nmore than 20 years of service.  While in the British military, he served as an exchange officer with\nthe U.S. military for about two years and had a limited DoD security clearance.  After retiring from\nthe military, Applicant and his family came to the United States.  Since then, he has been\nconsistently employed by Federal contractors.  He, his wife, and his children became U.S. citizens\nin 2013 and 2014, and all of them reside in the United States.\nUnder Guideline B, \u201c[t]he SOR alleges that Applicant served as an officer in the British\n[military] . . . ; that he expected to inherit a share of his mother\u2019s property . . . ; that he maintained\ncontact with \u2018many foreign nationals\u2019 due to his U.K. citizenship and [British military service]; that\nhe has friends . . . who are serving in the British Military; and that he possessed a security clearance\nfrom the U.K. . . .\u201d  Decision at 6-7.      \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased.  His mother, who suffers from dementia, and his two brothers\nare citizens and residents of the U.K.  His mother\u2019s home was sold to help pay her assisted-living\nexpenses.  Applicant anticipates that he and his two brothers will split some cash when their mother\npasses away.  One of his brothers works at an educational institution and the other is self-employed\nas a used car salesman.  Applicant and his wife have about $220,000 equity in their home in the\nUnited States.  \nApplicant has infrequent contact with about nine retired British military officers and one\nhigh-ranking officer who is still on active duty.  He maintains close contact with a retired British\n1 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(a) states \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion[.]\u201d\n2\n\nbrigadier general who was his classmate.  He maintains contact with a few former U.K. friends and\nneighbors.  He maintains occasional contact with a retired officer who had served as his second in\ncommand.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nDepartment Counsel declined to submit a request for administrative notice of facts pertaining\nto the U.K.  While an administrative judge may sua sponte take administrative notice after providing\nthe parties notice, a judge is neither obligated to gather information nor authorized to act as an\ninvestigator for either party.  The Judge concluded it would be inappropriate from him to assume\nthe role as assistant department counsel to obtain evidence to contradict Applicant\u2019s SOR answer\nor testimony.  The Judge further stated:\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f)2 require a finding of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d  Department Counsel\ndeclined to concede that \u201cheightened risk\u201d was not in issue.  (Tr. 14.)  However,\nnotwithstanding the admonition in AG \u00b6 6 that \u201c[a]ssessment of foreign contacts and\ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest is\nlocated,\u201d Department Counsel submitted no evidence, by way of administrative\nnotice, stipulation of fact, or otherwise, to show that Applicant\u2019s family members,\nfriends, former colleagues, or financial interests in the United Kingdom subject him\nto a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign inducement, exploitation, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.  I have considered whether Applicant\u2019s status as a retired British\n[military] officer and his continued association with active and retired members of\nhis [unit], standing alone, is sufficient to show the required \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nHowever, Department Counsel presented no evidence that the government of the\nUnited Kingdom, the U.K. intelligence services, or U.K.-based industries use retired\nmilitary officers to obtain classified, sensitive, or proprietary information.  He\npresented no evidence of attempts by the United Kingdom or U.S.-based industries\nto circumvent U.S. restrictions on export of military or dual-use technology.  Hence,\nI conclude that these disqualifying conditions are not established.  To conclude\notherwise would amount to speculation not supported by evidence.3  \nThe Judge also stated that mitigating conditions applied even if a potential disqualifying condition\nwere established.  Applicant\u2019s family members in the U.K. are not in positions likely to cause a\nconflict of interest.  Moreover, Applicant has developed deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties to the United States.  Whatever inheritance he may receive is outweighed by his financial\ninterests in the United States.  \n2 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(f) states \u201csubstantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk of\nforeign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest[.]\u201d\n3 Decision at 8-9.\n3\n\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \n \u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may remand or reverse a Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.2 and  E3.1.32.3.\nDepartment Counsel contends the Judge erred by concluding the Government failed to\nestablish a \u201cheightened risk\u201d under Disqualifying Condition 7(a).  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments\ncenter around the Judge\u2019s analysis in the paragraph quoted above.   Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that the Judge overemphasized the lack of a request for an administrative notice\nof facts pertaining to the U.K.,4 failed to consider appropriately the nature of the foreign contacts\n4 Department Counsel takes exception to the Judge\u2019s comments that noted the absence of a request for\nadministrative notice of facts pertaining to the U.K.  Specially, Department Counsel stated, \u201cthe Administrative Judge\nasserted that it was incumbent upon the Government to seek administrative notice of country conditions in all Guideline\nB cases, regardless of the country involved.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 6.  The Judge, however, did not make that specific\nassertion.  We view the Judge\u2019s comments as an expression of frustration about the lack of evidence on an issue he was\nobliged to consider.  Guideline B provides that a Judge should consider the country in which the foreign contacts or\ninterests are located.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 6.  The Judge noted the absence of evidence about the country\nconcerned created a \u201cvacuum.\u201d  Decision at 8.  Without evidence submitted by either party that sets forth facts about\nthe country concerned -- regardless of whether it is hostile, neutral, or friendly to the United States -- the Judge is left\nin a quandary about what facts he should consider about that country.  While the Judge acknowledged that he could sua\nsponte take administrative notice of facts about the country, he also noted the Directive does not authorize him to act\nas an investigator for either party and concluded it would be inappropriate for him to assume the role of assistant\ndepartment counsel.  This is error.\nThe Board has previously noted that an accurate and current assessment of the geopolitical situation and\nintelligence/security profile of the country vis-a-vis the United States is \u201ccrucial\u201d in Guideline B cases.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 07-14508 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2008).   This requirement holds true even if one supposes that the ultimate\nconclusion regarding the country\u2019s conduct and circumstances would not likely exacerbate the risks and vulnerabilities\ninherent in an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts.  (Remember, also, that the risks attendant to the contacts may be heightened\nregardless of the country\u2019s identity.)  The parties could have introduced pertinent evidence for official notice or through\nthe ordinary course of the hearing.  Failing that, the Judge could have notified the parties of official documents he\nplanned to notice regarding the country.  He could have given the parties an opportunity to respond, which, of course,\nwould have delayed the processing of the case.  The Judge cannot, however, fail to do part of the required analysis\nbecause he is frustrated by the choices made by the litigants.  Furthermore, a Judge may not summarily consider the\ncountry concerned, conclude it does not have a profile of any security significance (e.g., it is a friendly nation to the\nUnited States, close ally, strategic partner, etc.), and decide not to make an assessment of it in the decision.  Such a\nsituation is further exacerbated when the Judge is aware that the pertinent evidence is not in the record.  As we have\npreviously stated, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to discern what\nfindings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 23, 2018).\n4\n\ninvolved in the case, and improperly placed the burden on the Government to prove matters not\nrequired under Guideline B.\nWhile it is important for the Judge to consider the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact is located in Guideline B cases, the \u201cheightened risk\u201d language in Disqualifying Condition\n7(a) addresses an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts, not necessarily the foreign country involved.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 08-0448 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 08-09211 at 3-4\n(App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2010).  Depending upon the particular circumstances presented in a case, one or\nmore foreign contacts located in even a foreign country that is friendly to the United States may\ncreate a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n   \nIn the past, we noted with approval a Judge\u2019s analysis that concluded \u201cheightened risk\u201d is\nnot a high standard to meet.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013)\n(\u201cHeightened risk\u201d is a \u201crisk [that] is greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family\nmember living under a foreign government.\u201d).5  In the present case, Applicant graduated from a\nBritish military academy, held a British security clearance, and retired as a British military officer. \nHe testified:\nI have 20 years-odd service in the British [military] which, again, is close-knit, like\nany military organization, a close-knit community.\nAnd so, I retain friendship with probably about ten, if that, people.  Not that\nregularly.6\nHe noted that most of those friends are now retired from the British military because of their age. \nTr. at 44.  One of his retired friends went to work for the British government.  Tr. at 57.  He was not\nsure whether some of them are still working in the defense industry or had left such jobs.  Id.  The\nIn this regard, it also merits noting that we have previously cautioned Judges against reliance on overly\nsimplistic distinctions between \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.  We have\nrecognized that an assumption that a foreign nation does not pose a serious security risk under Guideline B because it\nis friendly to the United States ignores the historical reality that (a) relations between nations can shift, sometimes\ndramatically and unexpectedly; (b) even friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters that they view as important to their vital interests or national security; and (c) not all cases of espionage against\nthe United States have involved nations that were hostile to the United States.  Any analysis that seeks to rely in part on\ndistinctions between \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d nations must articulate a rational explanation for why the distinction is\nrelevant when Guideline B fails to articulate such a distinction.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 ( App. Bd. Mar.\n29, 2002). \n5 The Judge in present case has used a similar \u201cheightened risk\u201d analysis standard in the past.  See, e.g.,  ISCR\nCase No. 17-03623 at 7 (A.J. Jul. 27, 2018) (\u201cAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (e), and (f) all require substantial evidence of a \u2018heightened\nrisk.\u2019  The \u2018heightened risk\u2019 required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u2018Heightened risk\u2019 denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in living under a foreign government.\u201d)  \n6 Tr. at 43.\n5\n\nJudge also found Applicant maintains occasional contact with a retired officer who had served as\nhis second in command and maintains close contact with a classmate who is a retired British\nbrigadier general.  Most importantly, however, one of Applicant\u2019s friends, a high-ranking British\nofficer, remains on active duty.  While Applicant and the high-ranking officer do not keep in regular\ncontact, they served together in the same regiment and were neighbors at one point.  Furthermore,\nApplicant testified that, in the recent past, he attended a three-day meeting in which he was\n\u201crepresenting the U.S. government and my program management office\u201d and the high-ranking\nofficer was also in attendance.  He and the high-ranking officer talked on that occasion, but the\nsubstance of their discussions are not reflected in the record.  Tr. at 44-45 and 57-58.  In the\ndecision, the Judge did not make findings of fact that Applicant and his high-ranking British friend\nwere both involved in defense matters of mutual interest to the United States and the U.K. and they\nhad interacted with each other at an event involving such matters.7  When viewed in its entirety, the\nrecord supports a determination that the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts\ndo not create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nDepartment Counsel also challenges the Judge\u2019s apparent conclusion that disqualifying\nconditions were not established because the Government presented no evidence that the U.K., its\nintelligence services, or its industries use retired military officers to obtain U.S. classified, sensitive,\nor proprietary information.  Department Counsel\u2019s challenge has merit.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion in\nthis case has the practical effect of requiring Department Counsel prove affirmatively that the U.K.\nspecifically target U.S. citizens to gather protected information.  The Directive does not require the\nGovernment to prove affirmatively that a country specifically targets U.S. citizens in order to raise\nGuideline B security concerns.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09211 at 3.  See also, our discussion\nin Footnote 4 of this Decision. \nAlthough the Judge concluded that none of the Guideline B disqualifying conditions were\nestablished, he conducted an \u201ceven-if-they-were-established\u201d mitigation analysis and concluded \ncertain mitigating conditions applied.  His mitigation analysis, however, is flawed because it does\nnot address Applicant\u2019s contacts with retired and active duty British military officers.  From our\nreview of the record, the Judge\u2019s errors identified above are harmful and warrant corrective action. \nAccordingly, we conclude the best resolution of this case is to remand the case to the Judge for\n7  In this  case, the Judge also concluded that Disqualifying Condition 7(b) was not established.  Decision at\n9.  However, Applicant\u2019s testimony about his high-ranking British friend presents a classic conflict of interest situation\nunder Disqualifying Condition 7(b), which states, \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect classified or sensitive information\nor technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or\ntechnology[.]\u201d [Emphasis added.]  As a general proposition, individuals must avoid situations in which their personal\ninterests may conflict with their responsibilities to protect U.S. classified or sensitive information.  When a U.S. security\nclearance holder and his or her foreign friend represent their respective countries in a matter of interest to both countries,\nthere exists, at the very least, a potential conflict of interest under Disqualifying Condition 7(b).  In this case, the record\nis silent about what, if any, action Applicant took to disclose this apparent conflict of interest to appropriate U.S.\nauthorities and what, if any, other precautionary measures may have been taken.     \n6\n\ncorrection of the errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 16, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn November 27, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we remand the case.\nThe essence of this case concerns Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and her failure to have filed\nher Federal income tax returns for 2013 to 2015.  Applicant\u2019s problems were affected by some\ndifficult family circumstances, but the Judge concluded that she had not demonstrated responsible\naction in regard to her tax filing delinquencies and to three of her SOR debts.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s exhibits were original\ndocuments.  He proposed, without objection from either party, to read the contents of the exhibits\ninto the record and return them to Applicant:  \n[Judge]: I have a letter from [creditor] dated February 8, 2018 and the last four of the\naccount is [account number].  The balance is $1,141.72.  And it says in the middle\nof the letter, \u201cDear [Applicant], Thank you for your recent payment of $315.79.  We\ncredited this to your . . . account referenced above.  If you have any questions, please\ncall. . . . We have a copy of a lease dated November 15, 2009, and it\u2019s for an\napartment located in [name, address of apartment].  And looks like the rent per\nmonth is $1,985.  Does that sound right?\n[Applicant]: Yes, sir.\n[Judge]: Okay and the lease was supposed to end on 17 December 2010 according\nto the lease contract.  And so I guess what I have here is a lease for a different\nproperty starting December 3, 2010, and expiring on December 4, 2011.  Is that\nright?\n[Applicant]: Yes, sir.\n[Judge]: Okay.  And the debt originating from [vehicle dealership] . . . was assigned\nto [creditor] and it\u2019s now paid in full as of March 21, 2018. The letter is dated April\n3, 2018.  And she\u2019s also provided a copy of the contract to finance the [vehicle] . .\n. So let me give you all of this documentation back.  Thank you, ma\u2019am.  Tr. at 19-21\n2\n\nIn the Decision, the Judge stated that he had admitted \u201cthe content of Applicant\u2019s exhibits\u201d into\nevidence and that he had admitted all proffered exhibits.  Decision at 2.  Nowhere in the transcript\ndoes it show that he admitted Applicant\u2019s exhibits themselves, nor has he otherwise included them\nin the record.  There are two documents contained in Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR that may\ncorrespond to the description of the leases cited above, although the Judge does not state that this\nis the case.  None of the other documents that Applicant brought to the hearing are to be found in\nthe record.1  \nA Judge is required to prepare a full and complete record which is provided to the Board on\nappeal.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.19 and E3.1.29.  Failure to preserve a complete record is error and\ncan impair our ability to perform our review function.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08257 at 5 (App.\nBd. Feb. 8, 2007); see also ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and ISCR Case\nNo. 12-04540 at 4, n. 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2014).  Although the Judge summarized what he viewed\nas the pertinent aspects of Applicant\u2019s exhibits, we have no way of knowing with certitude what else\nthese documents may have contained that might have a bearing on the case.  We conclude, therefore,\nthat the Judge has failed to maintain a complete record, insofar as he admitted the content of\ndocuments without preserving the documents themselves for our review.  We see no meaningful\ndifference between a document and its content, and to admit the content of a document without\nadmitting the entirety of what that documents contains is something of a contradiction. Without\nbeing able to examine the documents that Applicant showed to the Judge, we cannot give\nappropriate consideration to the issues she has raised on appeal.  We conclude that the best approach\nis to remand the case to the Judge to identify the documents that Applicant desired him to consider\nand include these documents in the record.  The other issues that Applicant has raised are not ripe\nfor consideration.      \n1Applicant attached the documents regarding the vehicle to her Appeal Brief.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn November 27, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. and E3.1.30.\nAt the hearing, the Judge read the contents of Applicant\u2019s exhibits into the record and\nreturned them to the Applicant.  Those documents were not included in the record.  In a prior\ndecision on March 12, 2019,  we concluded the Judge failed to preserve a complete record which\nimpaired our ability to perform our review function.

Instead of accepting the NOA, we should\nhave referred the matter to the DOHA Director for appropriate corrective action.1  However, having\naccepted the NOA and permitted the parties to submit briefs, we are issuing this decision.\nThe Judge erred by failing to issue a clearance decision.

On\nJanuary 16, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn November 27, 2018, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mark Harvey initially denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance, which she appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.  On March 12, 2019, and June 11, 2019, we remanded this case to the Judge for\ncorrective action.  It is now before us on Applicant\u2019s appeal of the Judge\u2019s latest adverse decision \nthat is dated June 21, 2019.\nApplicant raised the following issue in her current appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was a 59-year-old employee of a Federal contractor. \nShe has served in the military and has retired from Federal civil service.  She has worked for the\nFederal government or government contractors for 41 years.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had Federal tax deficiencies.  She failed to file some of her\nFederal income tax returns in a timely manner.  She filed her 2013 Federal income tax return in\nNovember 2017 and her 2014-2015 Federal income tax returns in May 2017.  She indicated that she\ndid not file her tax returns as required because she was distracted by family issues that included a\nchild\u2019s and in-law\u2019s drug addiction, a child\u2019s incarceration, and a grandchild\u2019s severe injury.  She\nestimated she owes about $12,500 in past-due Federal taxes.  In February 2018, she began making\nmonthly payments of $380 to the IRS under a payment plan and made all of the scheduled payments\nup to the time of the hearing.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Federal tax debt and\nagainst her on the tax filing deficiency.     \nThe SOR further alleged that Applicant had seven other delinquent debts.  The Judge\u2019s\nfavorable findings on four of the debts are not contested on appeal.  The Judge found against\nApplicant on (1) a charged-off bank debt for about $500 that she conceded she did not get around\nto making payments to resolve; (2) a rental apartment debt in collection for over $4,200 that she\ndisputed, but failed to provided a copy of the dispute; and (3) a past-due debt for about $340 with\na balance of about $5,000 on an uninsured, wrecked vehicle that she said she plans to pay.\nWhile Applicant has resolved some debts, she did not act responsibly in handling other\nalleged debts.  She did not provide a good reason for failing to file her Federal tax returns in a timely\nmanner and did not show sufficient progress toward resolving three delinquent debts.  She has not\nestablished that similar financial problems are unlikely to recur.   \n2\n\nDiscussion    \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that were not presented to the\nJudge for consideration.  Such assertions include that she hired a debt resolution company and that\ncertain debts have been disputed and removed from her credit report.  The Appeal Board is\nprohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant also raised\nassignments of error regarding SOR allegations that the Judge found in her favor.  We need not\naddress those assignments of error.   \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that she has not made sufficient progress toward\nresolving her delinquent debts.  She argues she has demonstrated that she is dedicated to resolving\nher financial problems.  In her arguments, she highlights the family issues that contributed to her\nfinancial problems, her efforts to resolve them, and her character evidence.  The Appeal Board has\npreviously stated that the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to\nmake a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).  Applicant also argues that she does\nnot have access to classified information.   However, we have no authority to consider the extent to\nwhich an applicant may or may not actually have access to classified information in the course of\nhis or her job.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00508 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 23, 2015). \nApplicant has failed to show the Judge committed any harmful error.

On \nNovember 6, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nDecember 17, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were\nbased upon substantial evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged numerous instances of illegal drug use, criminal conduct, and\nprofessional difficulties (a performance plan due to illegal drug use).  The allegations that the Judge\nfound against Applicant consist of the following: Under Guideline H, Applicant used marijuana with\nvarying frequency from about 1974 until about 2016, and he sold and purchased marijuana from\nabout 1981 until about 1985.  Applicant\u2019s most recent uses of marijuana occurred in 2016, during\nwhich time he held a security clearance.  Regarding Guideline J, Applicant was arrested, charged,\nand/or convicted of criminal offenses regarding his drug involvement, such as possession of\nmarijuana and drug paraphernalia; felony possession and distribution of marijuana; and burglary and\npossession of marijuana.  In addition, Applicant\u2019s instances of drug misuse were cross alleged under\nGuideline J.  \nBecause of his 2016 arrest for possession of illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer placed him on a performance plan.  He was required to seek substance abuse counseling,\nmaintain a drug-free lifestyle, and pass random drug tests.  Applicant\u2019s drug tests yielded negative\nresults.  He has not used marijuana since September 2016, and he has disassociated himself from\npersons who use illegal drugs.\nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of his duty performance.  He is\nconsidered to be a strong worker who is thoughtful and trustworthy.  He provided vital support to\nmodernizing a company project, enabling his employer to stay abreast of the newest technologies\nand protocols.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nAs noted above, the Judge resolved many of the allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor, principally\nnon-drug criminal conduct that he found to have been mitigated by the passage of time.  However,\nhe entered adverse findings regarding Applicant\u2019s use and possession of marijuana and for his drug-\nrelated criminal conduct.  He noted evidence that Applicant had resumed marijuana use in 2016 after\n2\n\na nearly 20-year period of abstinence.  Because of this, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s much\nbriefer period of abstinence since 2016 is not sufficient to show that his security concerns have been\nresolved through attenuation.  He noted that several of Applicant\u2019s drug-related criminal infractions\nwere old, but he concluded that they form part of a pattern of misconduct that extends to 2016, when\nApplicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance. \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s findings contained errors, for example in the\nnature and disposition of several of his criminal charges.  We have examined the Judge\u2019s findings\nin light of the record.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based\nupon substantial evidence or constitute reasonable conclusions that could be drawn from the\nevidence.  Many of the Judge\u2019s findings were based on the answers Applicant provided to his\ninterviewer and on his testimony at the hearing.  Applicant has cited to no error in the Judge\u2019s\nfindings that likely affected the outcome of the case. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 16-02640 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 2, 2018).\nApplicant contends that the processing of his case took too long.  He argues that if he were\ntruly a security risk his adjudication would have been accomplished more expeditiously.  We have\nno authority to rule on the manner in which officials conduct clearance investigations and\nadjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04186 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2015).  Applicant has \nnot demonstrated that the time it took to process his case resulted in identifiable prejudice to him.\nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief constitutes a challenge to the manner in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence in mitigation.  He argues that he has overcome the concerns raised in the SOR\nand that \u201cI am a reasonable person and I deserve this mitigation.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 4.  He argues that\nsome of the concerns raised under Guideline J are redundant with those under Guideline H.  He also\ncontends that the Judge did not consider his favorable evidence, such as his character references.\nThe Supreme Court has held that no one has a right to a security clearance.  Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  In fact, there is a strong presumption against the grant\nor maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir.\n1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the Government presents evidence of security\nconcern, the applicant assumes responsibility for demonstrating mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nIn the case before us, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion\nis sustainable. An applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed on notice of its security\nsignificance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, may be lacking in the\nqualities expected of those with access to national secrets.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at\n2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered\nall of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that he Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id.  Concerning Applicant\u2019s redundancy argument,\nthe Government can allege the same conduct under different Guidelines and weigh the evidence\ndifferently.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-01281 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2014).         \n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 24, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether he was denied due process.  The\nJudge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E have not been raised as an issue on appeal and are not\ndiscussed further below.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had multiple delinquent debts.  The Judge found against him\non three of those debts, i.e., a  mortgage account charged off for about $24,400, a credit account\ncharged off for about $5,500, and a credit card account charged off for about $4,100.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant needed to show greater progress toward reestablishing financial stability\nto fully mitigate the financial security concerns.  In his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge\nany of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact or conclusions.1  \nAt the outset, we note that Applicant submitted an appeal brief on December 28, 2018.

We\nexamined the record as a whole in analyzing Applicant\u2019s alleged denials of due process.  In his brief,\nApplicant contends that he was not provided a copy of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\n1 The Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing\nparty has the burden of identifying factual or legal error that warrants remand or reversal.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-\n01047 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 20, 2005).  In his appeal brief, Applicant does state, \u201cThere are several mistakes in the report.\nI work with officers that have never done an SF86 or Backgrounds.  Some have questionable issues in the past.\u201d \nPresumably, Applicant is referring to the Judge\u2019s decision when he uses the term \u201creport.\u201d  The Judge made no findings\nor conclusions about Applicant\u2019s claim regarding the security clearance status of other security officers.  In his closing\nargument, Applicant briefly mentioned that coworkers stated, \u201cWe didn\u2019t even do the e-QIP, you know, or took this\nlong.\u201d  Tr. at 129.  However, he did not present any evidence on that issue at the hearing.  Arguments by parties are not\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03392 at 2, n.3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2015).  By raising this issue for the first time\non appeal as a basis for challenging his adverse clearance decision, he is effectively submitting \u201cnew evidence\u201d that the\nAppeal Board cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Moreover, the security clearance status of other individuals or\nwhether they were required to complete security clearance applications as part of their employment are not relevant\nconsiderations in determining Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  Each case must be adjudicated on its own merits. \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \n2\n\ninvestigation.2  At the hearing, Applicant submitted an exhibit reflecting that he requested a copy\nof the OPM investigation, and the following exchange occurred:\n[Judge]: Here\u2019s a request -- marking as Applicant Exhibit L, this is a one-page\nrequest for his investigative file.  Did you receive that file?\n[Applicant]: I did not.\n[Judge]:  Did not.  Okay.  There is no date on this.  When did you request it?\n[Applicant]:  It was when I -- when I got the background stuff.  There was a separate\nform saying I had to request it, so I sent it right after that.\n[Judge]:  And they haven\u2019t complied with that request, I guess.\n[Applicant]:  No.\n[Judge]:  All right.  Well, given that, I don\u2019t know what the status is.  Did you ever\ncontact Department Counsel to ask -- to ask if they could help you? -- no? -- obtain\nthat?\n[Applicant]:  No.  The first time I talked to him was probably a couple [of] weeks\nago, I think, when I called him.\n[Judge]: All right.\n[Applicant]:  But it didn\u2019t  -- that didn\u2019t come up in conversation.  I just didn\u2019t...\nunderstand the whole process.\n[Judge]:  Okay.\n[Applicant]:  So I was calling him about making sure he knew I got his emails and\nstuff.\n[Judge]:  Okay.  Are you prepared to continue with your case here, nothwithstanding\nyou did not receive your investigative record?\n[Applicant]:  I think I can cover --\n   \n[Judge]: Okay.\n2  DOHA is not a release authority for OPM investigations.  As part of the Government\u2019s exhibits, Applicant\nwas provided a copy of the OPM investigator\u2019s summary of his interview.  GE 2.   \n3\n\n[Applicant]:  -- the issues.3  \nGiven his response to the Judge\u2019s last question, Applicant effectively waived any objection that he\nmay have had to proceeding with the hearing without the OPM investigative report.4 \nApplicant raises another due process issue by claiming Department Counsel misled him. \nApplicant states that, in a prehearing conversation with Department Counsel, \u201cI was [led] to believe\n[Department Counsel] was going to help me.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  Essentially, Applicant claims that,\nif he had known that Department Counsel \u201cwould be using the information for the best interest of\nthe government[,]\u201d he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have explained myself so honestly giving myself a better chance\nto present my case.\u201d  Id. at 1-2.  The record does not support Applicant\u2019s claim that Department\nCounsel misled him.  First, Applicant has failed to specify exactly what Department Counsel stated\nto mislead him, what information he provided Department Counsel that now concerns him, and how\ndisclosure of that information may have harmed him.  Second, Applicant did not raise this issue at\nthe hearing and, therefore, did not provide the Judge an opportunity to inquire into it.  Normally, a\nparty is expected to raise objections or similar claims in a timely manner during the proceeding\nbefore the Judge in order to preserve them for appeal.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 03-06212 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2006).  Third, as noted in Applicant\u2019s above-quoted statements at the hearing,\nhe first called Department Counsel \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d before the hearing to make \u201csure he\n[Department Counsel] knew I got his emails and stuff.\u201d  By using the term \u201cstuff,\u201d Applicant is\napparently referring to Department Counsel\u2019s discovery letter (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1) that\nforwarded to him the proposed Government exhibits.  HE 1was sent to him more than four months\nbefore the hearing, which was held on May 17, 2018.5  In HE 1, Department Counsel advised, \u201cI am\nthe attorney assigned to represent the Government at the hearing\u201d at which \u201cyou may represent\nyourself, retain an attorney, or be assisted by a personal representative, such as a friend, family\nmember, or union representative.\u201d  Moreover, on April 19, 2018, Department Counsel sent\nApplicant an email advising that the Judge planned to schedule his hearing for the following month.6 \nIn that email, Department Counsel appropriately identified himself as \u201cDepartment Counsel,\u201d and\n3 Tr. at 40-41.   \n4 The Directive does not provide that applicants are entitled to their background investigations; rather, it states \nthey are entitled to \u201ca copy of any pleading, proposed documentary evidence, or other written communication to be\nsubmitted to the Administrative Judge.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.13.   The record reflects that Applicant was provided with the\ndocuments and procedural rights to which he was entitled under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Tr. at 9-14\nand 16-23.  Additionally, Applicant has not made any proffer that the OPM investigation contains information that would have\nchanged the outcome of this case.  Based on the record, the issue of whether the OPM investigation contains information\nfavorable to Applicant is a matter of speculation.  \n5 HE 1 is dated January 3, 2018.  It was sent to Applicant by a different Department Counsel from the one who\nrepresented the Government at the hearing.\n6 Department Counsel\u2019s email dated April 19, 2018, is attached to the Reply Brief, which constitutes matters\nfrom outside the record that we are generally precluded from considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However, we will\nconsider new evidence insofar as it bears upon threshold questions such as jurisdiction or due process.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).  \n4\n\ninformed Applicant that \u201cyou may hire an attorney to assist you, bring a non-attorney to assist you,\nor represent yourself.\u201d  Furthermore, on April 24, 2018, the Judge sent Applicant the Notice of\nHearing that contained the Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR)\nHearing and Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings.  In the Prehearing Guidance, the Judge advised\nApplicant \u201c[t]he hearing is an adversarial proceeding in which the parties have the responsibility to\npresent their respective cases[,]\u201d notified him \u201c[t]he Government is normally represented by an\nattorney known as a Department Counsel[,]\u201d and informed him of his rights to obtain attorney or\nnon-attorney representation.  Contrary to Applicant\u2019s contention, the record reflects that Department\nCounsel appropriately advised him of his role in the proceeding and of Applicant\u2019s representation\nrights.  Fourth, there is a presumption that Department Counsel carried out his duties properly and\nin good faith.7  Applicant has failed to rebut the presumption.  Based on our review of the entire\nrecord, we conclude that Applicant has not established a prima facie showing that he was denied the\ndue process afforded him by the Directive.8 \nApplicant also contends that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \u201csaid\nwith my background and experience I was not a threat to security.\u201d9  Appeal Brief at 1.  The\nstatement Applicant is citing, however, summarizes his responses to the investigator\u2019s questions. \nIt does not constitute the investigator\u2019s opinion as to Applicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03069 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2015).  In any event, even if an investigator\nprovided such an opinion, it would not bind the DoD in its evaluation of an applicant\u2019s case.  Id. \nAdditionally, Applicant notes that he does not have access to classified information in the\nperformance of his duties.  However, this is not a relevant matter for our consideration.  Our\njurisdiction is limited to consideration of whether the Judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial\n7  \u201c[T]here is a well-established legal presumption that Government officials carry out their duties properly and\nin good faith, and a person seeking to rebut or overcome that presumption has the burden of presenting clear evidence\nto the contrary.\u201d  See, ISCR Case No. 02-20947 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 18, 2004) (citing, National Archives and Records\nAdministration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 174 (2004)).\n8 Applicant also contends that he spoke to the Judge on the telephone before the hearing, she pulled his file from\nthe rotation, \u201cshe felt she had minimal concerns[,]\u201d and gave him additional time to submit matters if he so desired.   He\nalso asks the question, \u201cIf there was a concern for my clearance then why pull it from the rotation?\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2. \nThis contention fails for lack of specificity.  It does not assert the Judge committed any harmful error.  An appealing\nparty must state with sufficient specificity what it is about a Judge\u2019s decision that he or she believes constitutes error so\nas to enable reviewing authorities, such as the Appeal Board, to address the assignment of error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 14-05920 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016).  The Judge\u2019s purported comment about having \u201cminimal concerns\u201d\napparently relates to her thoughts about delaying the hearing.  While the Directive provides that Judges shall conduct\nall proceedings in a timely manner (\u00b6 E3.1.10), they are generally permitted to exercise their discretion in scheduling\nhearings.  Applicant has not explained how the Judge\u2019s decision to give him additional time to prepare his case inured\nto his detriment.  \n9 Applicant is apparently basing this statement on a line in the summary of his background interview that states,\n\u201cThere is nothing in the Subject\u2019s background that could place the Subject in a position to be blackmailed or coerced.\u201d \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 2, marked as Page 11.  See also, AE W in which Applicant states, \u201cThis is a copy of the\ninvestigation [summary of background interview] done by OPM.  In the report it states 4 times \u201cThere is nothing about\nthese circumstances that makes the subject vulnerable to blackmail, coercion, or being under duress.\u201d     \n5\n\nevidence; whether the Judge adhered to the procedural requirements of the Directive; and whether\nthe Judge\u2019s rulings and conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. \nWe have no authority to consider the extent to which an applicant may or may not actually have\naccess to classified information in the course of his or her job.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00508\nat 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 23, 2015).  \n  \nApplicant was provided the procedural rights afforded him under the Directive.  He has not\nestablished that his security clearance adjudication was unfair.  The Judge examined the relevant\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on\nthis record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent\nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

He served honorably in the military, including in Iraq\nand Afghanistan, and has been awarded a number of medals and decorations.  He was granted a\nsecurity clearance in 2005.  He is unmarried but cohabitates with his fiancee.  They have a child. \nThe SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling about $121,000.  It also listed a foreclosed\nmortgage and a 2013 Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was dismissed.  In responding to the SOR, he\nadmitted, in whole or in part, with comments the foreclosed mortgage, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy\ndismissal, and four of the delinquent debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s father has medical issues.  For about ten years, Applicant has supposedly been\nsupporting his parents with monthly payments \u201cwhich he inconsistently quantified as $500, $700,\nand $1,000.\u201d  Decision at 4.  He also has been paying for his fiancee\u2019s medical and housing expenses\nand has been sending her child support.  He did not submit documentation to show he has been\nmaking any of those payments.\nIn 2013, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, primarily to save his residence from\nforeclosure.  The bankruptcy reflected that he owed about $208,000 in secured claims, including\n$8,000 in mortgage arrears;  approximately $3,500 in unsecured priority claims; and over $134,000\nin unsecured nonpriority claims.   While residing overseas with his fiancee, his employment contract\nexpired.  Due to medical and childcare expenses and a lack of income, he was unable to comply with\nthe bankruptcy plan.  The bankruptcy was dismissed with no payments having been made to\ncreditors.  In 2014, his residence was foreclosed upon.\nIn March 2017, Applicant told an investigator that, after the bankruptcy, he hired a law firm\nto negotiate settlements of his debts and set up payment plans.  Those efforts did not include the\nforeclosed mortgage.  He failed to provide documentation of those efforts.  During the interview, he\n2\n\nalso indicated that he expected to take action to resolve the delinquent debts that month.   About nine\nmonths later, he enrolled in a credit counseling service to customize his plan and review options.  \nAlmost a year after the SOR was issued, Applicant engaged the services of a credit repair\norganization to challenge the accuracy of his credit reports by disputing accounts.  He was unable\nto explain the specific reasons that would constitute a reasonable basis for disputing the debts. \nAround this time, he also engaged services of a professional debt organization to negotiate\nsettlements of his debts.  The debt settlement program lists five creditors with debts totaling over\n$121,000 for which settlements are to be negotiated.  Under this program, he is to pay about $1,800\na month for 53 months, which includes a fee of about $30,000.  \nApplicant resolved an alleged credit card account of about $6,200 by paying a settlement of\nabout $2,500 in 2017.  He is in the process of resolving two other accounts.  For one of these\naccounts, he negotiated a settlement of about $18,000 on an unsecured loan of about $45,000.  The\nsettlement was negotiated approximately one year after the SOR was issued.  He submitted\ndocumentation of several payments made towards that settlement.  For unexplained reasons, he \ndisputed this debt after reaching the settlement.  For the other account, he negotiated a settlement\nof about $4,000 on a credit card account of about $10,700.  This settlement was negotiated about 15\nmonths after the SOR was issued.  He submitted documentation of one payment under this\nsettlement.  \nApplicant likely owes a deficiency on the foreclosed mortgage because the unpaid balance\non that account was about $27,000 more than the property\u2019s fair market value at the time of the\nforeclosure.  He disputes the mortgage account without providing a reason.  Four of the other alleged\ndebts remain unresolved.  They include a charged-off credit card account of about $10,300; an\nunspecified account of about $31,000; a credit card account of about $14,700; and a credit card\naccount of about $2,400.  The first two of those accounts are listed in his debt settlement program,\nbut are not yet in the process of being resolved.  With regard to the latter two accounts, Applicant\ninitially denied these debts in his SOR response claiming they were paid; in doing so, however, he\nreferred to debts with different account numbers in support of his contention that they were paid. \nThese latter accounts remain unresolved in the absence of documentation establishing resolution. \n \nApplicant\u2019s income has fluctuated between $80,000 to $140,000.  He has an average monthly\nremainder of over $1,300.  Days before the hearing, his annual salary increased to $154,000.  In a\npost-hearing submission, he provided a budget that reflected monthly debt payments totaling $2,145\nand a monthly remainder of about $3,700.  He provided character references who attest to his\nprofessionalism, integrity, and trustworthiness.\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Analysis\nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts remain unaddressed.  Despite a recent net\nmonthly remainder of about $3,700, Applicant has chosen not to increase his monthly debt payments,\nand it is unclear why he is unwilling to do so.  Applicant also failed to explain why he got into debt\nbefore his bankruptcy.  Considering his salary, he \u201cmight have more reasonably started addressing\n3\n\nhis creditors in 2014, not waiting [to] 2017 to do so.\u201d  Decision at 16.  He decided to address his\ndelinquent debts about the time of his background interview, hired a law firm to negotiate\nsettlements, and took some meaningful actions.  He has resolved or is in the process of resolving\nseveral of the delinquent accounts.  He also failed to document other claimed resolution efforts. \nAdditionally, because he was unable to provide a reasonable basis for disputing the legitimacy of\nsome accounts, he is not given credit for those disputes.  \nMitigating Conditions 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply.1 Although applicants who begin\nresolving debts after their clearances are in jeopardy may be lacking in judgement and self-discipline,\n\u201cthere is clear evidence that Applicant took some resolution actions before he received the SOR.\u201d \nDecision at 16.  Security clearance adjudications are not debt-collection actions, but instead are\naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  An applicant is not\nrequired to establish resolution of every debt.  In this case, \u201cApplicant had demonstrated a belated\nbut good track record of debt reduction and elimination efforts, [finally] taking meaningful and\ndocumented corrective actions with respect to his delinquent debts.\u201d  Decision at 22.  \nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl.  2\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\n1 These mitigating condition are listed in Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20 as follows:\n\u201c(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization\nby predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c)  the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source,\nsuch as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; [and]\n(d)  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d\n \n4\n\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the record in this case does not support the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable Guideline F mitigation and whole-person analysis.  He persuasively argues that, even\nthough the Judge discussed many of Applicant\u2019s financial shortcomings, he reached a decision that\nruns contrary to the weight of the evidence.  Of note, the following findings, conclusions, or record\nevidence undercuts the Judge\u2019s favorable decision:\na.  Applicant has a history of financial problems, which, of course, began before he filed\nChapter 13 bankruptcy in 2013.  All of the debts in the SOR were listed in the bankruptcy petition. \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 5.2\nb.  Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment in 2014, the birth of his child, and his subsequent\nchild support obligations all occurred after he filed the bankruptcy.  Consequently, there is no causal\nconnection between those conditions and Applicant\u2019s initial financial problems.  Id.  \nc.  Applicant failed to document that he had been supporting his parents for ten years and\nprovided inconsistent information about the amount of that support.  Decision at 4.3    \nd.  When asked at the hearing the reasons why the delinquent debts were incurred, Applicant\neither did not know or provided responses such as for \u201cexpenses\u201d or \u201cgas.\u201d  Tr. at 59-65.\ne.  Since his reemployment in October 2014, Applicant has been earning a yearly salary\nranging between about $110,000 and $140,000.  Tr. at 29-30, 48-49, and 55-56.\nf.  While reemployed and earning income, Applicant claimed in his 2016 security clearance\napplication (SCA) that he was negotiating debt settlements (GE 1) and claimed in his 2017\nbackground interview that he \u201cexpects to be in the process of resolving them this month.\u201d  GE 2. \nHowever, no proof was offered to show he took those claimed actions in a prompt manner. \ng.  Although he resolved one of the smaller debts after his background interview (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit (AE) J), he did not start making payments towards the other debts until about a year after the\nSOR was issued. AE T and Z.\n2 Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition reflects that he had an $8,000 mortgage arrearage.  GE 5, Schedule D. \nAdditionally, a credit report reflects that the date of last activity on a number of his accounts was a month or more before\nhe filed bankruptcy.  GE 3.     \n3 Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition reflects his father was providing him a monthly contribution of $500.  GE 5\nat Schedule I, line 13.  In Schedule J, line 13c, however, it also reflects that he has an average or projected monthly\npayment of $700 to his parents for their support.   \n5\n\nh.  Regarding the two debts for which the Judge found that Applicant was resolving,\nApplicant provided documentation of making three payments on one account and one payment on\nthe other account.  Decision at 6-7; AE T and Z.4\ni.  Five of the alleged debts, which constitute a significant amount of Applicant\u2019s delinquent\ndebt, remain unresolved.  He has not shown any progress on resolving three of those debts, which\nincludes the likely deficiency on the foreclosed mortgage.  Decision at 6-7.  \nj.  Despite having a significant net monthly remainder, Applicant has apparently chosen not\nto increase his monthly debt payments to effectuate a more rapid resolution of the debts.  \u201c[I]t is\nunclear if he unwilling to do so.\u201d  Decision at 14.  \nk.  The Judge made multiple findings and conclusions implicating Applicant\u2019s veracity and\nreliability.  The Judge repeatedly used language such as \u201cpurportedly,\u201d \u201cclaimed,\u201d and \u201csupposedly.\u201d\nHe noted several instances of uncorroborated statements.  \nThe above circumstances undermine the Judge\u2019s conclusions that Mitigating Conditions\n20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) applied in this case.  Applicant did not address his financial problems in any\nmeaningful manner for many years.  Most of Applicant\u2019s actions that the Judge relies on to mitigate\nthe financial security concerns were taken after the SOR was issued.  As we have previously stated,\nthe timing of resolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case\nfor mitigation because an applicant who takes action to resolve financial problems only after being\nplaced on notice his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self-discipline to\nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own\ninterests.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017).  In short, given his\nfailure to account clearly for why he encountered his financial problems, his lack of action in\naddressing them over the years despite a considerable income, and his recent steps taken to resolve\nthem only after his security clearance was placed in jeopardy, Applicant has failed to establish that\nhe acted responsibly and in good-faith under the circumstances.  \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious because it runs contrary to\nthe weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record evidence, viewed as\na whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard. \nThe decision is not sustainable. \n4 AE Z reflects that Applicant enrolled with the debt settlement organization in September 2018.  He has been\nmaking the $1,833 monthly payment towards that program from October 2018 until at least February 6, 2019.  See AE\nT and Z.  While five debts are enrolled in that program, the debt settlement organization has so far only negotiated\nsettlements for two of those debts.  \n6\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.    \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan              \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel\nJames B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMichael J. Harris, Esq.\n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On October\n17, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nNovember 1, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by admitting\nhearsay; whether the Judge\u2019s credibility determination was in error;  and whether the Judge\u2019s overall\nadverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we\naffirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for a Government contractor since 2016.  Before that, he worked for\nanother contractor, resigning from that employment in April 2016.  While in the previous\ncontractor\u2019s employ, Applicant was advised that he would be laid off.  He found other work within\nthe same company, which he performed until his resignation.  \nIn late March 2016, Applicant was called to a meeting with the company\u2019s Human Resources\n(HR) officer and with a representative of the corporate office.  He was questioned by the corporate\nrepresentative about nearly 500 hours that Applicant allegedly worked at night.  Applicant claimed\nthat he was given authority to work outside core hours, but he did not provide corroboration. \nBelieving that he had no future with the company, Applicant resigned.\nA letter from the company\u2019s security manager stated that Applicant resigned in lieu of\ntermination as result of an internal investigation.  This investigation concluded that he had\nmischarged his time during 2015 and 2016 for a total of nearly 500 hours.  This conclusion was\nbased upon a review of Applicant\u2019s badge access records, witness interviews, and Applicant\u2019s 2015\nperformance review.  \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor stated that Applicant never attempted to manipulate the system\nfor personal gain.  His current supervisor described him as reliable, and performance appraisals from\nhis prior job show that he met expectations.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant did not corroborate his claim that he had authority to work outside core hours. \n\u201cHis action of resigning from a position he held for 16 years immediately after being confronted by\nHR about his time mischarging creates a reasonable inference that he did so to avoid termination for\ncause.\u201d  Decision at 5.   The Judge found Applicant\u2019s denial of wrongdoing to be lacking credibility. \n2\n\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by admitting Government Exhibit (GE) 2, the letter\nreferenced above that summarized the findings and conclusions of the company inquiry into his\nalleged mischarging of hours.  He argues that admission of this document denied him the right to\nconfront witnesses against him, as set forth in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22, which forbids admission of oral\nor written statements adverse to an applicant unless there is an opportunity for cross examination. \nHe also argues that the admission of this document was contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in \nGreene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474 (1959).  We evaluate a Judge\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of\nevidence to see if they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).\nAs the Judge found, GE 2 is a letter from the facility security officer (FSO) of Applicant\u2019s\nprevious employer.  It states that, in compliance with paragraph 1-302a of the National Industrial\nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM),1 it constitutes notice to the Defense Security\nService of Applicant\u2019s resignation in lieu of termination for the reasons described by the Judge in\nhis findings.  This letter is unquestionably hearsay, and Applicant did not have an opportunity to\ncross examination the FSO.  However, despite the broad language of \u00b6 E3.1.22 when read by itself,\nhearsay is generally admissible in DOHA hearings.  The Directive does not grant a right of\nconfrontation greater than, or even coextensive with, that enjoyed by criminal defendants, in whose\ncases out of court statements are often admitted under exceptions to the hearsay rule.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 11-12461 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2013).  Paragraph  E3.1.22 must be read in light\nof the Directive as a whole and not in such a way that it would render other provisions therein a\nnullity.  Id.  Therefore, \u00b6 E3.1.22 does not forbid the admission of hearsay evidence that is\nadmissible under other paragraphs of the Directive.  See, e g., ISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 4 (App.\nBd. Jun. 25, 2009). \n \nAs Department Counsel argues in her Reply Brief, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 permits the admission \nat a DOHA proceeding of official records or evidence compiled in the regular course of business,\nwithout an authenticating witness.  Additionally, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19 provides that the Federal Rules\nof Evidence (FRE) serve as a guide in DOHA proceedings.  FRE 803(6) permits the admission of\nrecords of regularly conducted business activity.  A report that an employer is legally required to\nmake is part of the employer\u2019s regular course of business.  See, e.g., Lewis v. Baker, 526 F.2d 470,\n473-4 (2d Cir. 1975).  \nAccordingly, under the facts of this case, a document that Applicant\u2019s former employer was\nrequired to submit by the provisions of the NISPOM relevant to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\n1DoD 5220.22-M, dated February 2006, \u00b6 1-302a: \u201cAdverse Information.  Contractors shall report adverse\ninformation coming to their attention concerning any of their cleared employees.\u201d  See also \u00b6 1-300: \u201cContractors are\nrequired to report certain events that . . . impact the status of an employees personnel security clearance[.]\u201d\n3\n\nto national security information is an official record under \u00b6 E3.1.20.2  It is also a business record\nunder FRE 803(6).  Such evidence is admissible despite a hearsay objection because it is considered\ninherently trustworthy.  The trustworthiness of GE 2 is enhanced by the extent to which it is\ncorroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in GE 1, security clearance application (SCA), at 12.  In this\nexhibit, Applicant stated that his employer questioned the time that he charged for work done and\nthat he decided it was in his best interest to resign.  \nConcerning Greene v. McElroy, we concur with Department Counsel\u2019s argument that in this\ncase the Supreme Court did not establish an absolute right to confrontation in a security clearance\nadjudication.  Rather, it held that the procedures employed by the DoD in denying a clearance\nwithout granting the applicant a right of confrontation had not been properly authorized either by\nthe President or by Congress.  Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, upon which the Directive is founded, corrects this legal infirmity.  All in all, we conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision to admit GE 2 was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that his denials of wrongdoing were not\ncredible.  We are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations unless they are\ncontradicted by other evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 6 (App. Bd.\nAug. 18, 2015).  In this case, the challenged conclusion is a reasonable interpretation of the record. \nGE 2 states that an inquiry conducted by his employer established that Applicant had overcharged\nhis hours.  An employer\u2019s description or characterization of events underlying an adverse action are\nentitled to at least some degree of deference.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00114 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n30, 2014).  As stated above, this document is corroborated by other evidence.  In addition to GE 1,\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing supports its credibility.  See Tr. at 31-34, in which he\nacknowledged that company representatives accused him of overstating his hours, after which he\nresigned from the company because he decided that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see any future there afterwards.\u201d  We\nalso note the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant did not corroborate his claim to have been authorized\nto work outside his normal duty hours.  We find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination.  \nWe are persuaded by Department Counsel\u2019s argument that Applicant\u2019s brief constitutes, in\nlarge measure, a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  Such a disagreement, or\nan ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).    \n2The term \u201cofficial records\u201d in E3.1.20 is not defined.  Official records are not listed as an exception to the\nhearsay rule in the FRE; however, public records are listed.  The term \u201cpublic records\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201c[a] record\nor statement of a public office if . . . it sets out . . . a matter observed while under a legal duty to report . . . .\u201d  FRE\n803(8).  We interpret \u201cofficial records\u201d to include writings authorized by law or regulation to be recorded or filed in a\npublic office, such as adverse information reports.  Compare, FRE 901(b)(7) and 902(4).  We also note the FRE shall\nserve as a guide and the technical rules of evidence may be relaxed in security clearance proceedings.  Directive E3.1.19. \nFurthermore, the criminal penalty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 for knowingly and willfully providing false documents to the\nU.S. Government provides an indicia of reliability and trustworthiness to documents recorded or filed as required by law\nor regulation.   See also, FRE 807.\n4\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 12, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nNovember 28, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born in China, coming to the U.S. in the late 1990s.  Her husband was also\nborn in China.  They became U.S. citizens in the late 2000s.  Applicant and her husband have one\nchild.  Their net worth is about $2,000,000.  Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of China. \nThey worked for a government entity and both receive retirement benefits from the Chinese\ngovernment.  Applicant speaks with her parents telephonically about once a week.  Applicant\u2019s\nfather-in-law was a high-ranking official in the Chinese government, now retired.  She speaks with\nhim about once a month, although these conversations are difficult because her father-in-law is\nhearing-impaired.  Applicant has never spoken with him about his government service.  Applicant\ncontributes to charitable organizations.  She enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of her\nwork performance as well as for her trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \nChina is one of the most active and persistent collectors of U.S. protected information. \nChinese intelligence services seek to exploit Chinese citizens or those with personal ties within\nChina, in order to obtain secrets.  It has targeted computer systems around the world, including those\nin the U.S.  It likely employs means that violate U.S. laws.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s family ties within China pose a heightened risk of\nforeign coercion.  He concluded that these ties could pose a conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s\ndesire to help her foreign relatives and her obligation to protect classified information.  He also\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s relationship with her husband, with whom she shares living quarters,\nposes a heightened risk of foreign coercion.1\nHaving found that Applicant\u2019s family ties within China raised security concerns, the Judge\nthen evaluated Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  He noted evidence of the high esteem in which\nApplicant\u2019s colleagues hold her, her substantial assets within the U.S., and her lack of any assets in\nChina.  He also cited to evidence that Applicant has rarely visited China since becoming a U.S.\n1Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 7(a-b, e).  \n2\n\ncitizen, that she has difficulty speaking with her father-in-law due to his hearing impairment, and\nthat she has lost touch with former friends in China.  He concluded that it is unlikely that Applicant\nwill be confronted with a conflict of interest or be coerced into disclosing protected information, due\nto her parents poor health, the attenuated nature of her relationship with her father-in-law, and her\nlong-standing ties within the U.S.\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted\nor proven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered\nfor national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive,\nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).\nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts\nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment;\nit fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs\ncontrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference\nof opinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nIn Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government and its intelligence-\ngathering history are important considerations.  There is a rational connection between an\napplicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are adverse to those of the U.S. and the risk that\nthe applicant may fail to protect classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-08412 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015).   In-laws represent a class of persons who are contemplated by the\nDirective as presenting a potential security risk.  As a matter of common sense and human\nexperience there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to,\nthe immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-06831 at 3\n(App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2011).\n  \nIn addition to drawing our attention to the findings summarized above, Department Counsel\ncites to other things in the record that bear upon the soundness of the Judge\u2019s decision.  For example,\nChina has a large, professionalized cyber-espionage community but also utilizes private citizens or\norganizations to target U.S. data.  Moreover, China has a poor human rights record and, among other\nthings, engages in surveillance of telephone conversations, fax transmissions, emails, text\nmessaging, and internet communications.  Government Exhibit 2, Request for Administrative\nNotice, at 8.  Department Counsel argues that this evidence significantly undercuts the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis.\n3\n\nWe find Department Counsel\u2019s argument to be persuasive.  The tenor of the Judge\u2019s analysis,\nviewed as a whole, suggests that Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives are too obscure to be of concern,\ngiven his findings and conclusions about the length of time in which they have been retired from\ngovernment employment.  We have noted in the past that the relative obscurity of foreign family\nmembers does not provide a meaningful measure of whether Applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a\nsecurity risk.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03112 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015).  In any event, not\nall of Applicant\u2019s relatives are necessarily obscure, given the high rank that her father-in-law held\nduring his career, which in and of itself is a matter of concern.  Id.2   Given record evidence that\nChina monitors telephone and electronic communications, the Judge\u2019s emphasis upon the ages of\nApplicant\u2019s relatives, their limited technological prowess, and the many years since they retired from\ngovernment employment does not logically mitigate a real concern that through regular telephonic\ncommunications these relatives could be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention\nof Chinese officials interested in acquiring U.S. information.  \nIn presenting her argument, Department Counsel cites to ISCR Case No. 12-04780 (App. Bd.\nNov. 13, 2013), in which an applicant\u2019s Chinese relatives posed security concerns.  The applicant\u2019s\nparents were retired farmers with whom he communicated once a week, and he also communicated\nwith other relatives and acquaintances on a regular basis.  These relatives appear to have been even\nmore obscure than those of Applicant in the case before us.  Nevertheless, the Judge concluded that\nChina\u2019s aggressive espionage activities against the U.S. and its willingness to exploit family\nrelationships to that end, precluded the favorable application of any of the Guideline B mitigating\nconditions.  We find persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the circumstances in the case\nbefore us are of equivalent significance.  We are further persuaded the Judge failed to engage in\nmeaningful analysis of the adversarial nature of the Chinese government3, as the Judge did in the\nearlier case that Department Counsel cited, which detracts from his favorable analysis.  Similarly,\nin this case, the Judge made no findings of fact, nor did he analyze record evidence regarding the\nnature of the Chinese government and its conduct with regard to human rights.  There is evidence,\nfor example, that the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is an \u201cauthoritarian state\u201d that engages \u201cin\n[r]epression and coercion [of] individuals and organizations...\u201d  There is evidence of \u201cillegal\ndetention...torture and coerced confessions.\u201d  Government Exhibit 2.  A Judge is not required to\ndiscuss each and every piece of record evidence in making a decision, which would be a practical\nimpossibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 30, 2018).  However, the\nJudge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person\ncould expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).  The Judge\u2019s failure to discuss China\u2019s adversarial\nrelationship with the U.S., its approach to human rights and its aggressive intelligence gathering in\n2\u201cAn applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or through a family member, to persons of high rank in a foreign\n[government] (such as his in-law), are of concern because it is foreseeable that through such an association the applicant\ncould come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information.\u201d  \n3See ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007), ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov.\n9, 2007), and ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008).\n4\n\nhis analysis of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation is a significant defect, undermining his conclusion\nthat Applicant had met her burden of persuasion.    \nTo summarize, Applicant was born in and educated in China, and her parents and father-in-\nlaw are citizens and residents of that country.  Her parents were employed by the Chinese\ngovernment and receive retirement benefits from it.  Her father-in-law is retired from a position of\nhigh governmental rank.  Applicant speaks with her parents by telephone weekly and with her\nhusband\u2019s father monthly.  China is an aggressive collector of U.S. protected information and\nmonitors telephone and other forms of communication.  Given this evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat these concerns are mitigated by the age and infirmities of Applicant\u2019s relatives, and a paucity\nof analysis of the threat posed by the Chinese government, undermine his favorable decision.  The\nJudge\u2019s decision fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the weight of\nthe record evidence.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable under the Egan\nstandard.\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.   \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan              \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid B. Hanley, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nNovember 2, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn September 26, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nDepartment Counsel appealed the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nOn December 18, 2018, the Appeal Board remanded the case to the Judge to correct\nidentified errors, to provide the parties the opportunity to submit additional evidence, and to issue\na new decision.  On April 2, 2019, the Judge issued a Decision on Remand in which he denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appeal appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\nanalysis of the evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s Decision on Remand.\nIn our prior decision, we noted we did not disagree with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant had mitigated a state tax lien.  In the Decision on Remand, the Judge again found for\nApplicant on that state tax lien, which is not an issue in this appeal.    \nThe current appeal concerns two Federal tax liens totaling about $118,000 that Applicant\nadmitted in his SOR response.  The SOR reflects that the larger Federal tax lien was filed in early\n2014, and the other was filed in late 2015.  Both liens arose from the operation of Applicant\u2019s\nbusiness.  In his latest decision, the Judge noted Applicant submitted two exhibits on remand.1  One\nof those exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) I) reflected that Applicant made $72,000 in payments\nto the IRS under an installment agreement during 2014.  The other exhibit (AE J) showed monthly\npayments of Federal payroll taxes in 2014.  In the latest decision, the Judge also noted: \nApplicant remains delinquent on federal quarterly business taxes for the following\ntime periods:  December 2010, March and June 2011, September 2011, September\n2015, March 2016, June 2016, September 2016, December 2016, March 2017, and\nJune 2017.  He remains delinquent in unemployment taxes for December 2013 and\nDecember 2016.  Applicant remains delinquent on federal corporate taxes for\nDecember 2016.  In addition, the Government observes that Applicant\u2019s total\noutstanding Federal tax debt at the time of the [second] installment agreement was\n$109,230. [Decision on Remand at 3, footnote omitted.]\n1 In the Decision on Remand, the Judge incorporated by reference his findings of fact from his earlier decision.\nHe noted the two exhibits that Applicant submitted on remand did not change his original findings of fact.  Decision on\nRemand at 3.  \n2\n\nThe Judge concluded:\nThe open question is whether Applicant\u2019s modifications to his business tax practices\nhave been responsible.  The Government\u2019s strongest evidence on this point is that\nApplicant has consistently underpaid his federal taxes from 2010 through 2017,\nnotwithstanding installment agreements.  . . .  Applicant\u2019s persistent tax\ndelinquencies are evidence that Applicant\u2019s business reforms have not proven to be\nsufficient.  In short, the Government contends that Applicant has not acted\nresponsibly under AG \u00b6 20(b).2  I agree.  The Appeal Board found error in my\nconclusion that Applicant had complied with the IRS guidance that he \u201ckeep up with \ncurrent taxes.\u201d [Footnote omitted.]  Neither of Applicant\u2019s two exhibits submitted on\nremand give me a factual basis to find that Applicant has kept current with his taxes.\n[Decision on Remand at 4.]\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues that he has acted responsibly in addressing his tax\nproblems.  He points out that he has made payments of $72,000 under his first installment agreement\nand has been paying a $1,000 a month under a second installment agreement that he entered into in\nDecember 2017.  He contends that Mitigating Condition 20(g) applies because he has made\narrangements with the appropriate tax authority to pay the amount owed and is in compliance with\nthose arrangements.3  We do not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.  In ISCR Case No. 17-\n01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018), we observed:\nThe mere . . . existence of a payment arrangement with an appropriate tax authority\ndoes not compel a Judge to issue a favorable decision.  As with the application of any\nmitigating condition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. \nThe timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to consider in\nthe application of mitigating condition 20(g) as well as in considering aspects of\nother overlapping mitigating conditions, such as, in determining whether an applicant\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, whether an applicant\u2019s past financial\ndeficiencies are unlikely to recur, or whether an applicant initiated good-faith efforts\nto resolve financial problems. [Footnotes omitted.] \nIn this case, we note that Applicant\u2019s tax problems date back to 2010 and also include tax\ndeficiencies in a number of subsequent years.  Since the inception of his tax problems, significant\ngaps have occurred during which Applicant has not demonstrated any meaningful efforts to resolve\n2 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(b) states, \u201c the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death,\ndivorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d\n3 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(g) states, \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax\nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d\n3\n\nthose problems.  Additionally, his latest installment agreement was established after the SOR was\nissued.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge did not err in concluding that Applicant had\nfailed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising from the Federal tax liens.\nApplicant further contends that there is no indication the Judge considered the whole-person\nconcept in issuing his Decision on Remand.  In that decision, however, the Judge noted in Footnote\n14 that he \u201cconsidered the whole-person concept in reaching my conclusions on remand.\u201d\nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  These arguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence\nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684\nat 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge erred in his findings\nof fact and conclusions and (2) whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 15 delinquent debts.  Applicant rectified an alleged \nmortgage debt, which the Judge found in her favor.  The remaining debts total about $89,000.  Her\nhusband was unemployed for over a year in 2011-2012 and for about five months in 2018.  While\nhe pays for their child\u2019s private school tuition, maintaining their family of three primarily on her\nannual salary of about $135,000 has been \u201cvery hard.\u201d  Decision at 2, citing Tr. at 25.   She recently\nstarted a part-time job to supplement her income.  \nIn September 2018, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  At that time of the hearing, her\nproposed Chapter 13 plan was pending approval.  The bankruptcy paperwork also reflected that she\nhad a negative net monthly remainder.  In her post-hearing submission, Applicant submitted\ndocumentation of two payments to the bankruptcy trustee, but it was unclear whether the proposed\npayment plan had been formally implemented by the bankruptcy court.\nApplicant has multiple delinquent debts, some dating back a decade.   The lack of financial\ncontributions from her husband is sufficient to raise Mitigating Condition 20(b).1  About $89,000\nof debt is included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy for which she has not established a record of\nconsistent and meaningful payments.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief includes information not contained in the record, including some\ndocuments that post-date the Judge\u2019s decision.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \n1 Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(b) states, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death,\ndivorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d\n2\n\nIn her brief, Applicant challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.  In\nmaking those arguments, Applicant relies extensively on new evidence that, as noted above, we\ncannot consider.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusion are\nbased on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inference or conclusions that could be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).   \nApplicant argues the background investigator concluded she was not a threat.  In support of\nher argument, she quotes a sentence from the summary of her background investigation that states,\n\u201cThere is nothing in the subject\u2019s background or lifestyle that could be used against her as potential\ncoercion, pressure, duress or blackmail.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O. However, that sentence \nsummarizes Applicant\u2019s responses to the interviewer\u2019s questions.  It does not constitute the\ninterviewer\u2019s considered opinion as to Applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 14-03069 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2015).  In any event, even if an investigator provided such an\nopinion, it would not bind the DoD in its evaluation of an applicant\u2019s case.  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s argument amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  As we stated in the past, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  The Judge, as the trier of fact, has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). \n \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 19, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 11, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis  \nApplicant, who is 70 years old, has worked for his defense-contractor employer since 1987. \nHe has a doctorate degree and was initially granted a security clearance in 1979.  Over the years, he\nhas received security refresher, classified information user, and related briefings. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant risked a data spill when he directed a secretary to type a\nmemorandum containing protected information on an unclassified computer in 1995 and did not\ninform security officials of the potential data spill (SOR \u00b6 1.a).   It also alleged that he improperly\nemailed protected information on an unclassified network causing data spills in 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1.b),\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f).  The Judge found in\nfavor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b and against him on the remaining allegations.  \nApplicant\u2019s security incidents were not deliberate but persisted despite counseling.  In 1995,\nhe created multiple copies of a document that should have been marked Secret.  Upon learning that\nerror, he asked his secretary to retrieve them, but did not notify security officials.  Not all copies of\nthe document were retrieved, some were apparently discarded in the trash.  His noncompliance with\nreporting requirements may have led to compromise.  Additionally, his commission of four other\nsecurity violations since 2006 continues to cast doubt on his ability to handle classified information\nappropriately.  \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant notes he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in 2013 and argues that he was forced to submit another before\nhis five-year periodic submission was due.  Further, he contends that \u201c[i]t is illegal to perform e-QIP\ninvestigations in less than 3 years without merits . . . .\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  However, nothing in the\nDirective gives DOHA Judges or the Appeal Board jurisdiction or authority to pass judgment on the\nnecessity or sufficiency of security clearance investigations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-19823 at\n3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 3, 2003).  Additionally, there is no right to a security clearance.  Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Nor does a prior favorable security clearance decision\ngive rise to a vested right or interest in continued retention of a security clearance.  To the extent that\nApplicant\u2019s argument could be construed as raising the question whether DoD is equitably estopped\n2\n\nfrom denying or revoking his security clearance, it is unpersuasive.  The Federal Government is not\nrestricted in reviewing an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility; especially, as in this case, when\nan applicant has one or more security violations since submitting his or her previous e-QIP. \nApplicant\u2019s prior favorable clearance determinations do not entitle him to continued retention of a\nsecurity clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-19823 at 5. \nApplicant makes other arguments that we do not find persuasive.  First, he argues that,\nbecause the Judge found for him on SOR \u00b6 1.b, this confirms he always handled classified material\nin an authorized location with no unauthorized persons present and, as a result, he never committed\nthe alleged security violation in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  This argument is based on a false premise that the\nJudge\u2019s favorable finding under SOR \u00b6 1.b is evidence as to how he handles classified material.  In\nher findings, the Judge noted that the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b was apparently based on Applicant\u2019s\n2013 background interview in which his statements regarding an incident 15 years ago may have\nactually been referring to the 1995 incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that the\nevidence fell short of establishing the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b does not support Applicant\u2019s argument\nthat such a determination somehow establishes that the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a lacks merits. \nSecond, with regard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f, he argues that he had a need-to-know the information in\nquestion.  The issue of Applicant\u2019s need-to-know is not pertinent to the security concerns raised in\nthis case.  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f do not raise concerns about the legality of Applicant\u2019s access to the\ninformation in question; instead, they raise concerns about how he handled that information.  \nApplicant also questions whether his company may have erred in its security procedures. \nSpecifically, he contends that, while he knew the classification guide used in his department,  he did\nnot know the classification guide used in another department and other individuals failed in their\nresponsibilities to collect certain information from him.  At the hearing, the Government offered into\nevidence investigation reports for each of the security violations that the Judge found against\nApplicant.  Government Exhibits 3-11.  Each report concluded that Applicant committed the security\nviolation being investigated.  We give deference to the findings and conclusion of security personnel\nin such investigations.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018) (citing\nISCR Case No. 10-07070 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2012) for the proposition, \u201c[B]ecause of the unique\nposition of employers as actual administrators of classified programs and the degree of knowledge\npossessed by them in any particular case, their determinations and characterizations regarding\nsecurity violations are entitled to considerable deference, and should not be discounted or\ncontradicted without a cogent explanation.\u201d).  We conclude Applicant\u2019s argument that the company\nerred in its security procedures is an insufficient basis to challenge successfully the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable findings or conclusions under Guideline K.  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  In those arguments, he cites to such matters as his honesty and integrity in\ndisclosing his security incidents, the frequency of his security violations, and the length of time that\nhas passed since his last incident.  These arguments, however, are not sufficient to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2016).  Once it is established that an applicant has\ncommitted security violations, he or she has a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d to mitigate the resulting security\n3\n\nconcerns,  insofar as security violations \u201cstrike at the heart of the Industrial Security Program.\u201d  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 11-09219 at 3 (App. Bd.  Mar. 31, 2014).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.

On December 26, 2018, after\nthe hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A.\nCefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were\nsupported by substantial evidence, whether the Judge based his decision on information not\ncontained in the record, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we remand the case to the Judge.\nThe SOR alleged four delinquent debts.  The one allegation that the Judge found adversely\nto Applicant pertained to a $30,000 Federal tax lien.  The Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s earlier\nResponse to the FORM in support of his findings about this debt.  Applicant contends that the\nJudge\u2019s citation to the Response was an error because the Response was never admitted into\nevidence.  We find this argument to be persuasive.  At the hearing, Department Counsel offered\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application, interview summary, and credit reports, which the Judge\nadmitted.  Tr. at 8.

Neither party\noffered the Response, although it is located in the case file.    \nTherefore, it was error for the Judge to have cited to the challenged document in making his\nfindings of security concern.1  We conclude that the best resolution is to remand the case to the\n1 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7 provides that, if neither party requests a hearing, the case shall be assigned to a Judge \u201cfor\na clearance decision based on the written record.\u201d  It further provides that Department Counsel shall provide the applicant\nwith all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing (generally referred to as the File of Relevant\nMaterial or FORM) and applicant shall have an opportunity to respond to it.  The Directive envisions that the FORM\nand the applicant\u2019s response will be part of the written record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8 also provides that, if either party\nrequests a hearing, the Judge shall base the clearance decision on the \u201chearing record.\u201d  The Directive does not address\nthe conversion of a FORM proceeding into a hearing and provides no guidance how to treat a partial or full written\nrecord that was created before the hearing conversion.  Regarding this issue, we note a party\u2019s FORM submission often\ncontains arguments, which are not evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03392 at 2, n.3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2015).\nIn the Reply Brief, Department Counsel acknowledges that \u201cit would have been better practice to have admitted\nApplicant\u2019s response into evidence.\u201d   Reply Brief at 8.  We agree the better practice would have been for the Judge to\nhave clarified the evidentiary status of that document at the hearing.  Department Counsel also argues the previously\nsubmitted FORM (which presumably includes Applicant\u2019s FORM response) was part of the record and the Judge had\naccess to it.  While the argument that the parties\u2019 previous submissions pertaining to the SOR allegations are part of the\nevidentiary record and should have been considered by the Judge in rendering a decision is not an unreasonable\ninterpretation of the Directive, Department Counsel\u2019s handling of some FORM documents at the hearing undercuts that\nargument.  At the hearing, Department Counsel offered documents from the FORM into evidence as Government\n2\n\nJudge to give the parties a chance to offer the Response or object to its admission, as appropriate. \nThe Judge will then issue a new decision consistent with the Directive.  The other issues that\nApplicant has raised are not ripe for our consideration.\nOrder\nThe Decision is REMANDED.      \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

In completing a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2017, she did not disclose any derogatory financial information.

In about 1999, Applicant\u2019s husband was diagnosed with a serious illness that resulted in significant medical expenses. Shortly after returning to work, he lost his job, which resulted in a significant decrease in the household income. They received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2005. For approximately six months after the bankruptcy discharge, they remained financially stable until he again lost his job.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 1, 2018, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Nichole L. Noel denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in her findings and\nconclusions and whether Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant has been working for a Federal contractor since mid-2017.  She has previously\nheld a security clearance.  In completing a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2017, she\ndid not disclose any derogatory financial information.  An ensuing investigation revealed she filed\nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005 and had a number of delinquent accounts, including owing over\n$7,000 on a vehicle that was repossessed in 2014.   \nIn about 1999, Applicant\u2019s husband was diagnosed with a serious illness that resulted in\nsignificant medical expenses.  Shortly after returning to work, he lost his job, which resulted in a\nsignificant decrease in the household income.   They received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in\n2005.   For approximately six months after the bankruptcy discharge, they remained financially\nstable until he again lost his job.  Both of them have sporadic work histories.  \u201cBetween 2004 and\n2017, Applicant has held 11 jobs and experienced 6 periods of unemployment, the longest of which\nlasted from May 2004 to March 2008.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Applicant made payments towards two of\nthe alleged debts.  After her background interview, she contacted three other creditors to establish\npayment plans for debts.  She did not know how to contact the lender of the repossessed vehicle\nwhen the loan servicer went out of business.  She did not make payment arrangements for medical\ndebts when she learned those debts were charged off.  \nApplicant interpreted the financial questions on her SCA as seeking information about liens\nagainst property.  \u201cBecause she does not own any property, she did not believe the questions applied\nto her situation and skipped the next set of questions regarding delinquencies involving routine\naccounts, which sought information about automobile repossessions and collection accounts.  At the\nhearing, Applicant testified that she did not intend to falsify her security clearance application.\u201d \nDecision at 3.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant receives partial mitigation credit because circumstances beyond her control caused\nher financial problems.  However those problems are ongoing and she does not have the means to\naddress them at this time.  \n2\n\nApplicant failed to disclose information in her SCA about any of her delinquent debts,\nincluding a repossessed vehicle.  She claims that the omissions were due to her misunderstanding\nthe question.  She has completed an SCA in the past and the language of the question is clear on its\nface.  The record supports a finding that she intentionally falsified her SCA.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes character reference letters that are not contained in the record.  We\ncannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant rightly challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.  First, she \ncontends the Judge erred in finding she was unemployed from May 2004 to December 2008.  Her\nSCA employment history reflects that she was employed during that period.1  Next, Applicant\nhighlights a problem with the falsification allegation that asserted she falsified her SCA by\nanswering \u201cNo\u201d to pertinent financial record questions, \u201cwhereas, in fact, [she] knew of some or all\nof the debts listed in Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.m\u201d under Guideline F.  (SOR \u00b6 2.a).  Applicant\ncorrectly points out that one of those Guideline F allegations (SOR \u00b6 1.a) pertained to her 2005\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, which was outside of the SCA\u2019s seven-year reporting requirement for\nbankruptcies.  Consequently, the bankruptcy allegation should not have been incorporated into the\nfalsification allegation.  Although the Judge erred in finding that Applicant was unemployed\nbetween 2004 and 2009 and erred by failing to note that Applicant did not falsify her SCA when she\ndid not disclose the bankruptcy, we conclude those errors were harmless because they did not likely\naffect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013). \nThe Judge\u2019s other findings and conclusions were sufficient to support the unfavorable clearance\ndecision.  \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions in the Analysis section that Applicant is\na prior clearance holder, has completed a SCA in the past, and should have known the importance\nof providing full and complete answers to the SCA questions.  Applicant argues the Judge erred\nbecause she did not disclose her financial problems in the prior SCA, was also confused when she\nfilled out her prior SCA, and later discussed her financial problems during the prior background\ninterview.  We do not find merit in Applicant\u2019s argument.  Applicant\u2019s prior SCA and background\ninterview are not part of the record of this proceeding.  She is arguing facts not in evidence, which\nwe cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  On the other hand, the Judge\u2019s conclusions in question\nare based on substantial record evidence (i.e., Applicant\u2019s more recent SCA (Government Exhibit\n1) in which she disclosed that she previously held a security clearance and had her background\ninvestigated) or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).   \n1 At the hearing, the Judge specifically asked Applicant whether her longest period of employment was from\nMay 2004 to March 2008, and Applicant responded in the affirmative.  Tr. at 21-22.  The Judge\u2019s error regarding\nApplicant\u2019s employment history appears to be an oversight in drafting the decision.  \n3\n\nApplicant further argues that she did not intentionally falsify her SCA.  However, her\nargument is not fully consistent with her hearing testimony and is not persuasive.  As the Judge\nfound, Applicant testified at the hearing that she misunderstood the SCA question regarding liens. \nSpecifically, Applicant testified that she did not have any liens and \u201cif I would have understood\nthe question more I would have listed all my debts in there.  But I didn\u2019t understand, I thought\nit meant for a house and I rented so I didn\u2019t have a lien against my house.\u201d2  [Emphasis Added.] Tr.\nat 30 and 35.  Based on that testimony, the Judge inferred that Applicant skipped the remaining\nquestions regarding other financial delinquencies.   On appeal, Applicant raises for the first time that\nshe had a problem with the computer program and was not given the option to answer the remaining\nfinancial delinquency questions.  In her brief, she states:\nAfter I answered the question that I marked no that I didn\u2019t have any possessions or\nproperty voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed it didn\u2019t give the option of the other\nquestions that were listed as soon as I marked \u201cno\u201d it went on to the next set of\nquestions and I don\u2019t remember making \u201cno\u201d for the 120 days delinquent for any\ndebt.3    \nFirst, Applicant does not explain why she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking whether she had\nany property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed in the last seven years when her vehicle was\nvoluntarily repossessed less than three years earlier.  Second, she is again arguing facts not in\nevidence, which we cannot consider and do not establish that the Judge erred in her decision.  From\nour review of the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant intentionally falsified her SCA is\nsupported by substantial record evidence.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3.4    \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  Those arguments are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\n2 In Section 26 of the SCA, the question involving liens falls under a category of questions entitled\n\u201cDelinquency Involving Enforcement,\u201d while the questions involving repossessions, defaults on loan, collection\naccounts, charged-off debts, debts over 120 days delinquent, etc. fall under a category of questions entitled\n\u201cDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts.\u201d  GE 1.  \n3 Appeal Brief at 1.  Applicant does not explain why she did not seek assistance if she encountered a problem\nwith the SCA computer program, why she did not make an appropriate notation in the Additional Comments about the\ncomputer glitch or her debts, or why she certified the incomplete SCA as being \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best\nof [her] knowledge and belief .\u201d  GE 1.  \n4 The Judge did not make a specific finding regarding Applicant\u2019s credibility.  However, implicit in her findings\nis a determination that she did not believe Applicant\u2019s testimony.  The Directive provides that we must give deference\nto a Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \n4\n\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On June 21, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Bayard Glendon denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan.  All of his children are U.S. citizens.  His wife\nis an Afghan citizen who resides in the United States.  She has applied for U.S. citizenship.  \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased.  His four siblings and brother-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of Afghanistan.  He speaks with his sibling more than quarterly.  His brother-in-law worked\nfor an Afghan ministry but now apparently works for a private entity.  He has a number of nieces and\nnephews in Afghanistan.  His wife also has family there.  Applicant has travel to Afghanistan about\nten to fifteen times since immigrating to the United States.  \nApplicant is well educated.  In the past, he worked for the Afghan Government before being\nimprisoned due to his membership in a political party.  Upon his release, he moved to a neighboring\ncountry because he feared for his life.  He became a target there because he published an article\nopposing Islamic extremists.   He immigrated to the United States in the late 1980s and was granted\npolitical asylum.  In the late 1990s, he became a U.S. citizen. \nFrom 2008 to 2015, Applicant spent substantial periods living in Afghanistan.  He had a\nnumber of jobs during that period, some of which overlapped.  From 2009 to 2016, Applicant served\nas a officer of an organization he founded in Afghanistan.  He later indicated that he was not an\nofficer of that organization but just an advisor.  From the spring of 2012 to the spring of 2014,\nApplicant also worked for an Afghan ministry in a contract position funded through a U.S.\nGovernment agency.  In his capacity, he had contact with high-level Afghan Government officials. \n\u201cHe was offered a position with the Afghan government and was told to wait until after the election\nso he could assume the position.  He waited one year after the election, but in the end he was told\nthat he was not going to be appointed.\u201d  Decision at 6.  \nIn his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant responded in the negative to the\nquestion that asked whether any foreign national offered him a job in the past seven years.  His\nanswer was incorrect because he was offered such a position and believed it was a real opportunity. \nWhen questioned about the job offer during a security screening and at the hearing, he gave the same\ninconsistent response, that is:\n2\n\n[E]mphasizing the consulting job he had before the presidential election, not the job\noffer to work in Afghanistan after the election that he waited for a year to begin.  His\ntestimony did not clarify his reasoning for his negative response to the question.  The \nsource of the funds to pay his salary in a government job was irrelevant to whether\na foreign national offered him a job or asked him to work as a consultant. [Decision\nat 6.]\nHe also responded \u201cNo\u201d to the SCA question that asked whether he had any contact with a foreign\ngovernment or its representatives in the past seven years.  He defended his answer as a\nmisunderstanding of the word \u201ccontact.\u201d  His testimony on key points was lacking in candor. \n \nAfghanistan has had a turbulent history.  By the end of the 1990s, the Taliban controlled most\nof the country and imposed repressive policies.  Following military operations led by the U.S. and\nits coalition partners, the Taliban was forced out of power and a new democratic government took\ncontrol of the country in 2004.  Terrorists, however, remain active throughout the country and attack\nAfghan and coalition forces.  A U.S. Department of State advisory warns U.S. citizens against\ntraveling there because of instability and terrorist threats.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nDue to the activities of terrorists and insurgents, there is a heightened risk associated with\nApplicant having family ties in Afghanistan.  His past contact and association with high-level\nAfghan Government officials exposes him and his family to an even greater risk.  The evidence taken\nas a whole is sufficient to raise Guideline B disqualifying conditions.  Applicant\u2019s admitted and\nproven job offer from the Afghan Government or a small balance in a Afghan bank are not sufficient\nto establish any disqualifying conditions.  He did not present sufficient evidence that any of the\nGuideline B mitigating conditions apply.  In recent years, he has spent a significant amount of time\nin Afghanistan continuing his ties there and not developing ties in the United States.  \nThe evidence established that Applicant deliberately concealed information in his responses\nto two SCA questions.  His attempts to rationalize these responses demonstrates he deliberately\nprovided such responses rather than providing the requested information.  \u201cHis rationales regarding\nthe funding source of his work and the Afghan definition of the word \u2018contact\u2019 do not justify his\nconcealment of his job offer in Afghanistan and his close working relationships and history with high\nAfghan government officials.\u201d   Decision at 12.  \nIn his May 2016 security screening interview, Applicant mentioned that he received\na job offer to advise the new Afghan government and that he stayed in Afghanistan\nfor a whole year waiting for the job to begin.  Arguably, this disclosure to his\ninterviewers could be viewed as a prompt effort to correct the falsification in his\nSCA.  However, he equivocated and ended up telling the story that he was merely\nwaiting for another [U.S. Government] funded contractor position.  The screeners\nmade it clear in their report that they felt he was being inconsistent and was not fully\ncandid.  His testimony at the hearing was also lacking in candor and credibility.  As\n3\n\na result, the good-faith requirement of this mitigating condition is not present.  AG\n\u00b6 17(a) is not established with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a. [Id.]\nHis falsifications are not minor and go right to the issue of his trustworthiness.  He has not carried\nhis burden of persuasion. \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains a document and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.  \n Applicant\u2019s appeal brief  also contends that the record contains insufficient evidence to deny\nhis security request.  He argues that, while he spent a significant period of time in Afghanistan since\nbecoming a U.S. citizen, he worked on projects supporting the U.S. mission there in various ways. \nIn general, he asserts that the security concerns raised in his case are not significant to deny him a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  Some of his\nassertions on appeal fail for lack of specificity.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03372 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 19, 2018) (discussing the reasons why assignments of error must be set forth with specificity). \nOther issues that Applicant identified amount to harmless error because they did not affect the\noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  In general,\nhis arguments are a challenge to the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not enough to show\nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).  Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding\nthat Applicant received a job offer for a position in the Afghan government.  The finding is\nsustainable in light of the evidence in GE 2 at page 3.  The finding establishes a basic part of the\nadverse conclusion under SOR \u00b6 2.a regarding Applicant\u2019s negative answer to a question on his 2016\nSCA asking if in the last seven years he has received a job offer from a foreign national.  \nThe Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a\nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMark A. Myers, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 17, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision \u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn June 11, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 55 years old, has been working for her current employer since 2011.  Over\nthe years, she has had a successful career and has been lauded for her work performance.  Her first\nhusband passed away in 2012.  Until his death, he took care of the finances.  She indicated that it\ntook her over two years after his passing to begin to resolve her financial issues.  Her testimony was\noften vague as to her past and current financial situation. \nAs amended, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file timely her Federal and state\nincome tax returns from 2010 to 2016; she owed about over $21,000 in past-due Federal taxes for\n2010, 2011, and 2015; and she had 18 delinquent medical bills totaling over $10,000.  Applicant\nprovided documentation showing her 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax returns were filed late. \nNoting that she prepared some tax returns on her own and she also hired a tax preparer, she did not\nknow whether all of her delinquent Federal tax returns had been filed.  She believed her state income\ntax returns for 2010 through 2015 had been filed, but only documented the filing of her 2016 state\ntax return.  Applicant testified she thought that her past-due Federal tax debt had been paid through\ntax refund withholdings, but IRS documentation showed she still owed over $25,000 in Federal taxes\nfor 2010 and 2011.  However, her 2015 Federal tax debt was resolved.   \nApplicant admitted two of the delinquent medical debts but supplied no evidence showing\nthose debts had been paid.  She denied the other delinquent medical debts, claiming they were\nsuccessfully disputed because they no longer appeared on her credit report.  For some of the denied\ndebts, she provided dispute letters, but the amounts in those letters did not match the debts in\nquestion.  She failed to provide evidence to establish the denied debts were successfully disputed. \nHer delinquent medical debts remain unresolved.  \nApplicant did not provide documentation showing she entered into a payment arrangement\nwith the IRS.  The death of her husband caused some of her financial problems; however, she was\nunclear what actions she had taken or would take regarding them.  She did not present sufficient\nevidence to show that she acted responsibly in resolving her financial problems.  None of the\nGuideline F mitigating conditions apply in this case.  \n \nDiscussion\n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends the Judge \u201cfails to make mention that one of the root causes\nof the financial issues is the untimely and unanticipated death of Applicant\u2019s husband.\u201d  Appeal Brief\nat 8.  He further states \u201c[m]any of the debts were caused by the [medical] treatment and eventual\ndeath of Applicant\u2019s husband; yet this factor is noted nowhere in the decision.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 9. \nHe also argues those medical debts have disappeared from Applicant\u2019s credit reports.  We do not\nfind these arguments persuasive.  First, the Judge made findings and conclusions about the impact\nof the death of Applicant\u2019s first husband on her finances but determined that she did not act\nresponsibly in addressing her financial problems since his passing.  Second, the thrust of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision regarding the denied medical debts is that Applicant failed to provide sufficient\ndocumentation to substantiate any disputes.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App A. \u00b6 20(e).  Third, the fact\nthat a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent\nevidence as to the disposition of the debt.  Debts may fall off credit reports for various reasons,\nincluding the passage of time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00096 at 2, n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2019). \nIn short, Applicant\u2019s Counsel has not established that the Judge erred in his analysis of the medical\ndebts. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel argues the Judge \u201cfails to realize that [Applicant\u2019s] wages have no\nlonger been garnished bolstering her testimony that tax debts have been paid.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 11,\nciting Tr. at 36.  As the Judge found and the evidence establishes, Applicant testified that the\ngarnishment of her pay was for a state tax debt, which was not alleged in the SOR.  Decision at 3;\nTr. at 36 and 63; and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) F and H.  The termination of the garnishment for\na state tax debt does not establish the Federal tax debt has been paid.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel also\nstates, \u201cThere is no evidence to show that [Applicant] owes any federal or state taxes and her\ntestimony belies the statement of the Administrative Judge that she does.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 5.   This\nlatter statement is not accurate.  Applicant submitted a post-hearing exhibit (AE P) from the IRS that\nreflected she owed over $12,000 in Federal taxes, penalties, and interest for 2010 as well as over\n$12,000 for 2011 and over $4,000 for 2009.1  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel further contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record\nevidence and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  He argues,\nfor example, the Judge did not take into account Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, honesty, or integrity,\nincluding her excellent work performance.  His arguments are neither sufficient to rebut the\npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor are they enough to show\nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  We give due consideration to the\nHearing Office case that Applicant has cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board\nnor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id. at 3-4.  \n1 The 2009 Federal tax debt was not alleged in the SOR.  In a footnote, the Judge noted that he would not\nconsider that debt for disqualifying purposes, but could consider it in assessing the mitigating evidence.   Decision at 4,\nn.1. \n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  As we have previously stated, a person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal\nobligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high\ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017).  The decision is sustainable on this\nrecord.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with\nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.  On October 23, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Bayard Glendon denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

I hate life[.]\u201d  Id.   The colleague sought a protective order against\nApplicant based upon Applicant\u2019s emotional instability and threatening messages.  Applicant\u2019s\naccess to classified information was suspended, and his employer terminated him.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had been terminated but stated that he\ndid not recall the exact wording of his communications with the colleague.  In his background\ninterview, he stated that the colleague had been trying to provoke him and that before writing the\nmessages in question he had consumed alcohol and a prescription drug.  Applicant admitted to the\ninterviewer that he had previously sat for an interview by another Government agency (AGA).  He \ndisclosed that he had initially misled the AGA interviewer by surmising that the threats in question\nhad been sent by someone who had hacked into his on line social media account.  When the AGA\ninterviewer produced copies of the threatening messages, Applicant admitted that \u201cit looked like\nsomething I might say.\u201d  Id. at 4.  \nApplicant did not disclose his job termination in his security clearance application (SCA). \nHe claimed that he was not fired but, rather, \u201clet go\u201d because his clearance had been terminated. \n2\n\nId.  Applicant\u2019s excuse demonstrates that his omission was deliberate.  The Judge stated that this\nfinding was supported by Applicant\u2019s initial attempt to mislead the interviewer for AGA.1\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that none of the mitigating conditions had been established.  He stated\nthat Applicant had presented no evidence with regard to the threats, except to assert that he had been\ndrinking and taking a sleep aid medication.  The Judge concluded that, given the seriousness of the\nthreats, Applicant\u2019s explanation was not entitled to significant weight.  The Judge noted his\nfavorable findings for the alleged SCA omission.  However, he stated that he was considering the\nomission in evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation and for the whole-person analysis.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had not mitigated the concerns arising from his misconduct.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that the colleague sought a protective\norder.  He argues that this finding is a misreading of a memorandum for record by the FSO, included\nin the record as Item 4.  He contends that there is no evidence that the colleague actually sought a\nprotective order.  The pertinent language in the FSO\u2019s memo is as follows: \u201cI was contacted by the\n[sheriff\u2019s office] and advised that the [colleague] was seeking a protective order against [Applicant]\nas result of [Applicant\u2019s] expression of emotional instability and the threatening language of the\nonline conversation.\u201d  Item 4. The challenged finding is consistent with this evidence.  Even if the\nfinding is to some extent erroneous, it did not likely affect the overall outcome of the case and,\ntherefore, is harmless.  After considering Applicant\u2019s brief as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings are based upon substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences from the\nevidence.  Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-\n02640 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018). \nApplicant\u2019s argument that the Judge failed to consider mitigating concerns includes things\nfrom outside the record, which we cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.2  Applicant cites to matters\nthat he believes are favorable to him, such as evidence that his alleged threats were provoked by\nmessages that the colleague sent to him.  He also cites to his explanation that he was under the\n1The Judge resolved the allegation regarding the SCA omission in Applicant\u2019s favor because the allegation\nmisstated the date of the SCA.  \n2Applicant argues that our refusal to consider new evidence constitutes a \u201ckneejerk reaction.\u201d  Appeal Brief at\n6, n. 15.  Noting that we will consider new evidence on questions of due process, he contends that the Judge\u2019s purported\nreliance upon \u201cinaccurate evidence\u201d constituted violations of due process that justify our consideration of the additional\ninformation that he submitted along with his brief.  The prohibition against our considering new evidence is contained\nin the explicit language of the Directive, and we are bound by it.  Applicant\u2019 brief argues that the Judge misstated and\nmis-weighed the evidence, but he does not present a prima facie reason to believe that Applicant was denied an\nopportunity to present evidence in mitigation or that he was otherwise denied the due process afforded by the Directive.\n  \n3\n\ninfluence of a combination of alcohol and a sleep aid at the time of his conduct.  Applicant has not\nrebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 17-00109 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2018).  \nApplicant argues the Judge\u2019s decision is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion. The Board does not agree.  An ability to argue for a different interpretation\nof the evidence is not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10,\n2018). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 28,  2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 26, 2018, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we remand.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  From 2002 to 2015, he served\nin the military and was medically retired for injuries sustained overseas.  He began working for his\ncurrent employer in late 2016.\nIn August 2016, Applicant was terminated from a previous defense contractor job for erratic\nand irregular behavior over the course of several months.  In March 2016, Applicant reported two\nemployees for timecard fraud.1  The following day he was informed those employee were upset with\nhim.  Both employees were disciplined.  Before reporting the fraud, he was allowed to work a flex\nschedule, but afterwards he was no longer permitted to do so.  He believes the change in his\nschedule was done in retaliation for being a whistleblower.  He also believes those upset with him\nfabricated a story about his erratic behavior.  \nIn June and August 2016, Applicant also made statements that raised concerns.  Those\nstatements involve his email response to a Government contract representative in which he stated\nhe would \u201ccomply and adjust fire\u201d, advising his program manager his flex schedule only became\na problem out of \u201cretaliation\u201d, stating to his manager \u201cmisquoting me right now is dangerous\u201d, and\n1 One of those employees was Applicant\u2019s Government supervisor and the other was a coworker.  Tr. at 22, 38-\n39, and 54-55.  Applicant testified as follows:\n[Applicant]:  [The supervisor] is [the coworker\u2019s] supervisor and signs her timecard.  So, when I\nreported [the coworker], who is also friends with [the supervisor] socially, it offended [the supervisor]\nas well.  And [the  supervisor] was found to have not been keeping her time accurately as well, which\nwas not in my report.  I didn\u2019t report [the supervisor] in that capacity.\n[Department Counsel]: Understood.  But, because [the supervisor] signs off on [the coworker\u2019s]\ntimecard, it effectively impacted her as well?\n[Applicant]: That\u2019s correct.  And both of their times were adjusted and both of their schedules were\nadjusted. [Tr. at 54-55.]  \n2\n\ncommenting to a coworker \u201cPrepare to go to war in five minutes.\u201d   Decision at 3.  In essence,\nApplicant contended those statements were taken out of context.2  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements, when viewed as a whole, were unacceptable, scary and dangerous. \nHis on-going threats clearly demonstrate inappropriate and questionable behavior that cannot be\ntolerated.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \u201cIt is noted that Applicant was at one time in the military, and his\nvernacular of concern in this case is inconsistent with everyday civilian language.  Despite this\nexcuse, Applicant\u2019s misconduct is still unexplainable.  Applicant\u2019s behavior has created a hostile\nwork environment.\u201d  Decision at 6.   \u201cFrom the evidence presented, the culmination of these\nstatements reflect a warped mind-set and demonstrate a serious lapse in judgment that cannot be\ntaken lightly.\u201d  Id.\nDiscussion\nThe Appeal Board may remand a case to correct identified error and specify the action to be\ntaken on remand.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.33.2.   At the outset, we note the Judge erred by failing to address\nSOR \u00b6 1.e in her analysis and by failing to make any formal finding regarding that allegation. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.25 provides that \u201c[t]he Administrative Judge shall make a written clearance\ndecision in a timely manner setting forth pertinent findings of fact, policies, and conclusions as to\nthe allegations in the SOR . . .\u201d  This provision does not on its face authorize a Judge to enter\nfindings and conclusions only as to some of the allegations.  Rather, by its plain language it requires\nthe Judge to address all of them.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-07803 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009).\nThe Judge found against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b, which states: \u201cYou made a statement\nregarding \u2018retaliation\u2019 after finishing your discussion with your Program [M]anager on\napproximately August 17, 2016.\u201d   The evidence reflects that Applicant\u2019s program manger issued\nApplicant a \u201cDisciplinary Notice\u201d on August 16, 2016.  In the \u201cEmployee comments\u201d section of that\ndocument, Applicant responded by writing in part, \u201cI have an entirely different perspective that\nbrings to light the motivation behind these events.  The retaliation and level of harassment endured\nby me is being documented and substantiated with support from . . . leaders in the organization I\nsupport.\u201d  [Emphasis added.]  Government Exhibit (GE)5 and AE B.  Based on the Judge\u2019s findings\nof fact as well as our reading of the record, SOR \u00b6 1.b appears to be based on Applicant\u2019s written\n2 For example, Applicant contends that, when he stated in an email, \u201cI will comply and adjust fire,\u201d he meant\nthat he would \u201cadjust [his] course of action.\u201d  SOR reponse; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A; Tr. at 37-38, 44.  The individual\nto whom Applicant sent the email responded shortly thereafter by stating: \u201cNot an issue [Applicant]. Please continue\nto communicate clearly and continuously as u did in our conversation and with different elements of your surroundings\nand all will stay peachey.\u201d  AE A. This response does not reflect that the recipient of Applicant\u2019s email felt threatened\nor was  offended by the words in question.       \n3\n\nresponse to the Disciplinary Notice.3  In those comments, Applicant did not state that he was going\nto retaliate against anyone, but instead claimed he was the victim of retaliation.  The Judge erred by\nfailing to explain how Applicant\u2019s claim of being a victim of retaliation could serve as a legitimate\nbasis for the allegation against him in SOR \u00b6 1.b.4    \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge erred by failing to address his claim\nof being the victim of whistleblower retaliation. We agree.  The Judge made findings of fact that\nApplicant reported timecard fraud; that disciplinary action was taken against two employees,\nincluding his supervisor, because of his report; and that Applicant claimed he was retaliated against\ndue to his report.  Applicant claim of retaliation was the key point in his attempt to refute the SOR\nallegations.  The Judge, however, failed to discuss that claim in her analysis.5  We do not know\nwhether the Judge concluded there was any merit in his claim of retaliation and, if so, how any\nretaliation was factored into her analysis. \nApplicant also contends that the Judge was biased.  In doing so, he points out that she\nquestioned his use of military vernacular in a his workplace.  There is a rebuttable presumption that\na Judge is impartial.  A party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion\non appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012).   The transcript\nreflects that the Judge also stated she was offended by one of Applicant\u2019s alleged statements (Tr.\nat 45); she counseled him about \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d (Tr. at 56); she did not agree with, accept,\nor believe aspects of his testimony (Tr. at 57, 58, and 59); she stated she would have called the\n3 GE 2, an Incident History from the  Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), reflects in part:\nAnother statement was made on August 17, 2016 to the Program Manager (PM) in person at the\nProgram Office after he finished his discussion regarding statement of \u201cretaliation\u201d for reporting his\ncivil service customer.  The PM previously relayed to me that he received information from\n[Applicant] that [Applicant] was seeking legal counsel for \u201cretaliation.\u201d  During the interview, HR\nquestioned if [Applicant] had in fact sought legal counsel.  He informed HR he had not yet done so.\nThe apparent misinterpretation or misunderstanding of Applicant\u2019s statement regarding \u201cretaliation\u201d gives some credence\nto his claim that his other alleged statements were taken out of context.  Yet, the Judge failed to analyze that issue in her\nanalysis.  \n4 Defense contractors are provided protection from reprisal for disclosure of certain information.  See, 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2409.  We have long stated that the Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct\nunder any of the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-09511 at 3\n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2011).  However, based on the facts of this case, the presumption of nexus is rebutted.  Absent proof\nof some form of wrongful intent in claiming retaliation or in filing such a complaint, the mere making of such a claim\ndoes not raise security concerns under the Directive.  Prudence dictates that caution must be exercised in this regard to\navoid infringing upon a defense contractor\u2019s whistleblower rights.   \n5 Compare, Paragraph 7.3.c of DoD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program\n(PSP), dated April 3, 2017, which states:\nc. All personal security adjudicators, DOHA administrative judges (AJs), and Personnel Security\nAppeals Boards (PSABs) will, as part of their adjudication of an individual\u2019s eligibility, consider and\nresolve any claims of reprisal for whistleblowing.  \n4\n\npolice on him (Tr. at 58); and she twice counseled him to tell the truth (Tr. at 59).  Based on our\nreview of the record, we conclude a reasonable person might question the Judge\u2019s impartiality based\non the referenced comments.\nGiven these errors, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this case.  Because the\nJudge has expressed an unequivocal opinion about Applicant\u2019s alleged conduct and made comments\nduring the hearing that could cause a reasonable person to question her impartiality, the case should\nbe remanded to a different judge for a new hearing.  Applicant raises other issues on appeal that are\nnot ripe for consideration. \n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan       \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. \nOn March 22, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 8, 2018, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is 54 years old, has never been married, and has one adult child.  He was worked\nfor defense contractors on a military installation since about 2011.  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not file his Federal and state income\ntax returns for 2014-2016, that he had a Federal tax lien of about $1,400 for 2013, and had four other\ndelinquent debts totaling about $3,100.  He admitted those allegations with explanations, including\nthat the lien was for state, not Federal, taxes.  Department Counsel amended the SOR by changing \nit to reflect the correct holder of the tax lien and by adding three other delinquent debts totaling\nabout $11,100.  Applicant admitted the new allegations.  Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that\nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose on his security clearance application (SCA) his charges or\narrests for alcohol or drug-related crimes between 1983 and 2000, failed to disclose tax filing and\npaying deficiencies on his SCA, and provided false information to an investigator about income tax\nmatters.  He denied the Guideline E allegation pertaining to the alcohol and drug-related charges,\nbut admitted the other two.  \nApplicant testified that he had provided his 2014-2016 tax information to an individual to\nprepare his returns.  The individual, however, became involved in an unexplained fraud and did not\nfile Applicant\u2019s returns.  As of the hearing, the alleged tax income returns, as well as those for 2017,\nwere not filed.  In his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided prepared, unsigned, and undated\nFederal and state tax returns for those years.\nAll of the debts listed in the SOR remain unresolved.  Applicant attributed his financial\nproblems to his mother\u2019s medical issues dating back to at least 2005.  He relied on credit cards to\nprovide her support and was eventually unable to pay those debts.  She passed away in 2018. \nApplicant intends to resolve his debts by using refunds from his tax returns once they are filed.  He\nexpects to resolve all his debts over the next year or so.      \nApplicant has a lengthy criminal record, including 13 drug-related charges between 1983 and\n2000.  In his SCA, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question asking if he ever been charged with an\noffense involving alcohol or drugs.  He did disclose some delinquent debts in his SCA, but answered\n2\n\n\u201cno\u201d to the question that asked if he failed to file or pay his Federal or state taxes in the past seven\nyears.  At that time, he knew he had not filed his tax returns for 2014 and owed the alleged state tax\nlien.  When later questioned by an investigator, he confirmed his SCA answers and indicated he had\na minor problem with his 2015 returns.  His statement to the investigator was false because it\nimplied he filed his returns when he knew he had not done so.  Applicant claimed he likely misread\nthe questions because he was tired, stressed, and hurried.  He did not explain why he could not\nsimply have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the questions asking about drug-related charges or tax delinquencies. \nApplicant established a monthly repayment plan with a collection agency that became effective a\nweek after his hearing.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s debts have been delinquent for several years and remain unresolved.  While his\nfinancial problems resulted in part from his efforts to care for his mother, he has not shown that he\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.  He has not established any good-faith effort to repay the\ndebts.  He did not established that any of the debts are invalid.  He may have filed the missing tax\nreturns after the hearing.  He did not mitigate the financial trustworthiness concerns.\nApplicant intended to deceive the Government by withholding information from his SCA\nand by making false statements to the investigator.  The pertinent SCA questions plainly required\nhim to make the disclosures.  Applicant claim about misreading the questions was not credible.  It\nis not reasonable to conclude that Applicant overlooked either the 13 times he had been charged with\ndrug-related offenses or his failure to file his taxes.  His statements to the investigator also implied\nhe filed his taxes when he knew he had not.\n  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief contains documents and information that was not previously submitted to\nthe Judge.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse findings regarding the two alleged SCA\nfalsifications.  He first contends that he mistakenly answered \u201cno\u201d to the SCA question that asked\nif he ever had been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs.  He argues that he most\nlikely did not read the question correctly because he was tired, stressed, and unwisely completed it\nlate at night shortly before it was due.  He states that he intended to disclose the truth as he did over\nsix years earlier when he applied for his job.  Additionally, he states that he answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nSCA question that asked if he failed to file or pay his Federal or state taxes when required in the past\nseven years because he believed he had three years to file those tax returns and was unaware he\n3\n\nowed past-due state taxes.1  When evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge\nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record evidence.  See, e.g.,\nADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017).  As a practical matter, a finding regarding\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but\nrather may rely on circumstantial evidence.  Id.  Additionally, the Appeal Board gives deference to\na Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  From our review of the record, the\nJudge\u2019s findings that Applicant deliberately falsified SCA responses are based on substantial\nevidence or constitute a reasonable inference that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g., ADP\nCase No. 15-07979 at 4.  Finally, we note Applicant has not challenged the Judge\u2019s adverse finding\nthat he provided false information to the investigator, which is sufficient independently to support\nthe Judge\u2019s denial of his security clearance.  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a challenge to the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  For example, he argues that his debts were the result of him providing support to his\nailing mother, that he routinely filed his tax returns within the three-year period for obtaining a tax\nrefund, and that he is a loyal and trustworthy employee.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 16-01251 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2017).\n    \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  The standard applicable to trustworthiness\ncases is that is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding\nsecurity clearances: such a determination \u201c. . . may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with\nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d   Id.  See also, Kaplan v. Conyers, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir.\n2013), cert. denied.\n1 The Judge\u2019s decision contains a paragraph that is inconsistent with Applicant\u2019s admissions and denials to the\nGuideline E allegations as they appeared in the answer to the SOR.  This appears to be based on Applicant\u2019s testimony\nthat contradicted the clear language of his written answers.  Reading the decision as a whole, we conclude that this\nparagraph did not likely affect the final outcome of the case.\n4\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James F.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn November 28, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Jennifer Goldstein denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 64-year-old employee of a government contractor.  She was granted a security\nclearance in 2007.  She admitted receiving a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2017, but denied two\nmortgage accounts alleged in the SOR.  \nIn 2005, Applicant purchased a $367,000 home jointly with her cousin who did not have\ngood credit.  Applicant lived in the home with her cousin who promised to refinance the mortgage\nsolely in her name when she was able to do so, but that did not occur.  In 2006, the purchase loan\nwas refinanced into first and second mortgages with Applicant as the primary borrower on both\nmortgages and her cousin as a cosigner.  In 2014, Applicant gave her cousin two-years notice that\nshe would move out and would no longer pay the mortgages.  Her cousin, who received social\nsecurity disability payments, never contributed to the mortgage payments.    \nIn 2016, Applicant stopped making the payments on both mortgages.  She then proceeded\nto purchase a second home for $250,000, acquired about $38,000 in credit card debt for repairs to\nthe new home, and purchased a used luxury car for about $18,000.  She claimed she thought her\ncousin was making the mortgage payments, although she acknowledged her cousin never\ncontributed before and had no plan to pay them. \nFrom August 2016 to June 2017, Applicant\u2019s cousin failed to make the mortgage payments \nAfter the mortgages fell into default, Applicant tried to negotiate a deed in lieu of foreclosure on the\nfirst home, which was unsuccessful. She was advised to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Her bankruptcy\npetition listed over $640,000 in secured claims and over $38,000 in unsecured loans.  The\nbankruptcy docket page showed the trustee abandoned over $487,000 in secured claims on the first\nhome.  The first home was removed from the bankruptcy, foreclosed, and sold at auction.  Applicant\nclaims she has no further liability regarding the two mortgages on the first home.  Her credit report\nreflects those two mortgage have zero balances.  \nApplicant has participated in financial counseling.  She estimated her annual income for\n2017 to be over $80,000.  She is current on two credit cards.  \n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of her vacating the property she owned with\nher cousin.  She had no realistic expectation her cousin would make the mortgage payments.  She\nchose to abandon her financial obligation.  She has not shown that her financial problems were due\nto circumstances beyond her control or that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.  Her\nrecent financial decisions cast doubt on her judgment.  \n   \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains a document that is not included in the record.  The Appeal\nBoard is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \n \nApplicant contends the Judge did not review all of the facts in her case.  She argues that she\ndid not abandon the first home and that her cousin agreed to refinance the property and could afford\nto do so.  She also states that she tried to negotiate with the lender when she learned the mortgage\nloans were in default.  She notes she is not responsible for any balance on those mortgage loans and\nshe purchased the car because her old car was not worth repairing.  She argues she does not live\noutside her means.  Her arguments, however, are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the\nJudge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02488 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  Based upon the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant\u2019s poor financial decisions cast doubt on her judgment is sustainable.  Applicant also\nindicates that the loss of her security clearance is having a negative impact on her, but the adverse\nconsequences arising from an unfavorable clearance decision are not relevant considerations in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04202 at 4 (App.\nBd. Dec. 24, 2015). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On\nDecember 28, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn February 26, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Gregg A. Cervi denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nAs amended, the SOR alleged that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts totaling over\n$31,000, relinquished a deed in lieu of foreclosure, received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in\n2006, and failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns for 2013 to 2017.  She admitted the\ntax filing deficiencies during her testimony and admitted all but one of the other allegations in her\nSOR response.   In his analysis, the Judge stated:\nApplicant is well educated, makes a substantial income, and has experience running\na business.  Her unexplained failure to pay debts and a judgment when incurred, and\nto file income taxes when due, is troubling and inconsistent with a long-standing\nsecurity clearance holder.  Applicant\u2019s testimony appeared to be honest and\nstraightforward, but her failure to report her tax return delinquencies on her [security\nclearance application] is unfavorable and does not give me confidence that she has\na handle on her finances.  [Decision at 6.]\nIn her appeal, Applicant raises a due process issue.  She asserts that \u201chad [she] received\nnotice of the hearing in a timely manner, she may have been able to present resolution of financial\ndebt to the judge at the time of the hearing, however, her ability to resolve all matters post hearing\nmay have impacted the overall decision.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2.  She also asserts that the hearing notice\nwas not sent \u201cin time for her to prepare proof of being able to resolve the financial matters identified\nduring the hearing in the governments list of exhibits.\u201d   Id.  \nAt the outset, we note that Applicant was questioned about most of her financial problems\nduring background interviews conducted in June 2017.  Additionally, as noted above, the SOR was\nissued in late December 2017.  On February 21, 2018, and March 13, 2018, Applicant responded to\nthe SOR.  With one exception, she has been placed on notice of the Government\u2019s specific security\nconcerns regarding her financial problems months before her security clearance hearing, which was\nheld on August 29, 2018.   The one exception involves the amendment of the SOR at the hearing that\nadded the allegation concerning the tax filing deficiencies.   \nAt the hearing, Applicant initially indicated that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing\nuntil about four days before the proceeding.  At that point, Department Counsel advised the Judge\nthat Applicant was referring the Government\u2019s exhibits, not the Notice of Hearing.  Department\nCounsel further noted that the Government\u2019s exhibits were originally mailed to Applicant on May\n2, 2018, but Applicant did not receive them because she had moved.   Tr. at 6 and 21-23.  The\nfollowing exchange also occurred:\n2\n\n[Judge]:  All right.  So the notice went out on August 1 by email and at that time you\nshould have received the letter from the Chief Judge.\n[Applicant]:  I received notice of the hearing, I believe, but I was not able to -- I\ndidn\u2019t know what I needed to prepare for.\n[Judge]:  I understand that, but you received a letter[,] no the email[,] that was sent\naround August 1 from the Chief Judge.  \n[Applicant]:  Yes.   [Tr. at 6.]\nBoth Applicant\u2019s Appeal Brief and Department Counsel\u2019s Reply Brief contain information\nthat is not in the record.  Generally, we cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.  We have in the past, however, considered such evidence concerning threshold issues of\njurisdiction or due process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 8, 2015).  We note\nthat Department Counsel\u2019s Reply Brief contains email messages in which Applicant confirmed on\nAugust 14th (15 days before the hearing) that she received the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d and would attend\nthe hearing scheduled \u201cin [the designated city] on the 29th.\u201d   Attachment 3 of the Reply Brief.   From\nthe foregoing, we conclude that Applicant received proper notice of the hearing as provided by\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.8.\n     \nTo the extent that Applicant is contending that she did not received the Government\u2019s\nexhibits in a timely manner, we do not find that argument persuasive.  No precise time requirement\nis set for the parties to exchange discovery.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.13 provides that the parties shall serve\none another with copies of their proposed documentary evidence \u201c[a]s far in advance as practical.\u201d \nAs noted above, Department Counsel indicated at the hearing that she mailed the Government\u2019s\nexhibits (with the exception of GE 9) to Applicant\u2019s then-known address on May 2, 2018, but\nApplicant did not receive them because she had moved.  Applicant was eventually provided all of\nthe Government exhibits about four days before the hearing.  At the hearing, Applicant did not object\nto the admission into evidence of the Government\u2019s exhibits on the grounds of non-compliance with\n\u00b6 E3.1.13, unfair surprise, or similar basis.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 03-00543 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May\n21, 2004)(discussing the importance of raising procedural objections at the hearing).  Furthermore,\nthe Judge left the record open for about 16 days after the hearing to provide Applicant the\nopportunity to present additional matters.  In her post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that she\nreceived a \u201cwake up call\u201d during the hearing and provided information about the actions she had\ntaken to resolve her debts.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.  In that submission, she did not request an\nextension of time to submit further matters.  From our review of the record, Applicant has failed to\nestablish that she was denied the due process afforded her in the Directive.    \nApplicant also contends the Judge committed other errors.  For example Applicant notes that\nthe majority of her debts are for medical expenses, and the Judge did not consider health factors \u201cas\npart of the rationale for delinquency.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2.  She further asserts that she has never had\na security infraction.  Her arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the\nJudge considered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\n3\n\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n01284 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2015).  \n \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Applicant requested a hearing.  Prior to the hearing, Department\nCounsel withdrew the Guideline B and C allegations.  On November 30, 2018, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Jennifer I. Goldstein denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He has earned a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree and is enrolled in a master\u2019s degree program.  A professor and master\u2019s program director\npraised Applicant\u2019s performance as a student. \nApplicant admitted he received multiple traffic citations for speeding, uninspected vehicle,\nand failing to comply with traffic signals from 2004 to 2016.  He attributed his receipt of the\ncitations to working as a driver, although many were received before that employment.  He also\nadmitted to receiving two additional traffic citations in 2018.\nApplicant admitted he used marijuana in 2015.  He testified that he used marijuana six to\neight times at parties and claimed he had not used it since 2015.  Two drug tests he took in 2018\nwere negative.  He signed a statement of intent in which he pledged to abstain from further use of\nillegal substances.\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for felony embezzlement in 2007.  He was found guilty\nof a reduced charge, given a suspended sentence, and was required to pay restitution and perform\ncommunity service.  While working as a store clerk, he scanned store merchandise as if he was\nreturning previously purchased goods and issued himself a refund that was deposited directly in his\nbank account.  He indicated he did not understand his action were illegal.  He was terminated from\nthat employment.\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for forging public records in 2007.  He admitting forging\na date on a court document related to the above arrest to account for his absence from high school. \nThis charge was dismissed.  \nApplicant admitted that he falsified his 2017 security clearance application (SCA) when he\ndenied drug use in the past seven years.  During a background interview, he claimed he did not list\nhis marijuana use on that document because he did not think experimental use had to be disclosed. \n2\n\nHe testified that he omitted that information because he did not understand the question and wanted\nto know more about it. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant deliberately omitted his marijuana use from his SCA.   He has an extended history\nof questionable conduct.  \u201cHe incurred numerous traffic citations; used marijuana in violation of\nfederal criminal laws; lied about that marijuana use on his [SCA]; embezzled from his employer;\nand forged court documents submitted to his school.\u201d  Decision at 5.  None of the mitigating\nconditions fully apply.  His two traffic citations in 2018 demonstrate he had not yet learned to\ncomply with traffic rules.  He has not demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation to show similar behavior\nis unlikely to recur.   \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that he answered the SCA incorrectly because he did not fully understand\nthe drug-use question and subsequently corrected himself in the follow-up interview after obtaining\nclarification of the question.  He argues that the Judge erred in disregarding \u201cthe fact he did not fully\nunderstand the question and without a full understanding, [an] individual cannot deliberately act.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 9.  In his SOR Response, Applicant\u2019s answered the falsification allegation (SOR \u00b6\n1.e) stating:  \nI admit.   I falsified the answer because I was not sure if the question applied to me. \nAlso, I was waiting to be screened and discussed the question with my screener.  I\nanswered correctly after I got clarification from the screener on the spot.  \nOn July 24, 2017, Applicant submitted his SCA in which he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that\nasked whether he illegally used any drugs or controlled substance in the past seven years. \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1.  On the same day that he submitted his SCA, he also underwent a\ncounterintelligence screening.  GE 5.  The report of that screening reflects the following:\n43.  Describe your current and past drug usage.  Amount/frequency.\n \nCANDIDATE Response:  \u201cI experimented with marijuana a couple of times.  The\nlast time was in 2015.\u201d\nInterviewer Note:  CANDIDATE stated HE \u201cpuffed\u201d on a joint of marijuana \u201c10\ntimes\u201d in the course of two months in 2015.\n3\n\nThis information was not in HIS SF86.  HE stated HE did not think experimental use\nhad to be input in the SF86.  CANDIDATE later stated that HE wanted to talk and\n[sic] about it during the interview and see if the experimenting needed to be added.1\nWe agree the Judge erred in failing to analyze Applicant\u2019s contention that he did not understand the\nquestion when he submitted his SCA and, on the same day, disclosed his marijuana use during his\ncounterintelligence screening.  However, this error was harmless because, given Applicant\u2019s other\nquestionable conduct, it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-\n15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).   \nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not consider or properly weigh all relevant\nevidence.  For example, he argues he has learned from his past mistakes and claims the Judge did\nnot consider the passage of time that has occurred since his marijuana use or his \u201csevere criminal\nconduct.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 10.  His arguments, however,  are neither enough to rebut the\npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).   We give due consideration to the Hearing\nOffice cases that Applicant\u2019s Counsel has cited, but they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal\nBoard nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id. at 3-4.  We further conclude the Judge\nconsidered the totality of the evidence in compliance with the whole-person analysis requirements. \nSee Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(d). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

On February 14, 2019,  after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines H and I\nwere not raised as an issue on appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe SOR listed nine Guideline G allegations.  One of those allegations had four\nsubparagraphs and another had two subparagraphs.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted\neach of the Guideline G allegations with the exception of denying that he was diagnosed with heroin\nabuse disorder in 2009.1  The Judge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant relapsed into abusing alcohol in 2005 after 20 years of abstinence.  He\ncontinued to drink alcohol against medical advice until as recently as July 2017,\ndespite several inpatient alcohol-detoxification treatments and counseling programs\nfor diagnosed alcohol abuse disorder, severe.  He is presently committed to\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA), but it is too soon to conclude that his maladaptive use\nof alcohol will not reoccur.2\n  \nThe Judge found against Applicant on all of the Guideline G allegations.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant describes the Judge\u2019s summary of his clinical history as\n\u201cdetailed and thorough,\u201d although he claims there are a \u201cfew errors\u201d in her findings.

Id.  From our review of the record, we conclude that Applicant has\nnot identified any error that is likely to have affected the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 12-00678 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2014)(an error is harmless if it did not likely effect the overall\noutcome of the case.).\nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  Examples of these arguments include his claim the Judge mis-characterized his\ncurrent AA participation as comparable to his participation in earlier years, his contention that he\n1 Under Guideline G, SOR \u00b6 1.a alleged, \u201cIn May 2009, you were admitted to [hospital name omitted] for\nalcohol detoxification.

A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines F and H\nare not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant attended college but did not receive a degree, due to unsatisfactory academic\nperformance.  In 2010, he enlisted in the U.S. military and received a security clearance.  During his\nenlistment he received a letter of counseling, several letters of reprimand, and engaged in\nmisconduct such as disrespect toward superiors.  The military discharged Applicant for misconduct\nwith a general discharge under honorable conditions.  After his discharge from the military and\nwhile working for Defense contractors Applicant received a letter of counseling for insubordinate\nconduct.  In March 2015 he was dismissed from contractor employment after making a sexually\nsuggestive comment to a female enlisted member.  \nApplicant used ecstasy once in 2014 and marijuana once in 2015.  During this time he\npossessed a DoD security clearance.  He has not had contact with drug-using associates since 2015. \nHe attributed his drug use to poor judgment and to stress resulting from unemployment, a relative\u2019s\nsuicide, and his own cancer diagnosis.  After he was fired in 2015, Applicant has held several entry-\nlevel jobs at a candy distributor, a fast-food restaurant, and a construction company.

In August 2018, during\nhis current job, he received a letter of counseling for losing his temper and using inappropriate\nlanguage.  He still works at this job and has initiated mental health counseling to address his anger\nissues and other problems.1\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nAs noted above, the Judge entered favorable findings under Guidelines F and H.  However,\nhe arrived at the opposite conclusion concerning Guideline E.  He found that Applicant\u2019s military\ninfractions, drug misuse, and lack of professionalism during civilian employment raised concerns\nthat were not mitigated by such things as Applicant\u2019s mental health counseling and his candid\n1The incidents and adverse actions that occurred after Applicant\u2019s March 2015 job loss were not alleged in the\nSOR.  The Judge stated that he was considering these things on the issues of credibility, mitigation, extenuation, and the\nwhole-person analysis.  Decision at 9, n.16.\n2\n\nacknowledgment of his failures.  The Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s non-alleged misconduct in\nevaluating his evidence in mitigation.  In the whole-person analysis the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity-significant conduct was too recent to permit a conclusion that it was firmly behind him.\nDiscussion\nApplicant cites to his evidence of rehabilitation, such as the counseling he has undergone,\nhis expressions of remorse for his misconduct, the stressors that underlay his behavior, etc.  He\nargues that the Judge devoted too much attention to the negative aspects of his record and not\nenough  to his favorable evidence.  The Judge made findings about the things that Applicant has\ncited and addressed them in his analysis.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence\nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).  An ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the record is\nnot enough to show that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463\nat 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).\n  \nApplicant argues that the months that have elapsed since his last incident show that he has\nrehabilitated himself.  He believes that the Judge erred in concluding that not enough time had\npassed to show that his problems were behind him.  However, we have never drawn a bright-line\nrule as to the recency of misconduct.  The extent to which security concerns have become mitigated\nthrough the passage of time is a question that must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01847 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2015).  In this case, the Judge found, and\nthe record demonstrates, that Applicant\u2019s misconduct goes back many years, resulting in discharge\nfrom the military and multiple job terminations.  Accordingly, we cannot say that the Judge erred\nby concluding that Applicant\u2019s few months of good behavior are insufficient to show permanent\nbehavioral changes.\nApplicant\u2019s brief cites to matters from outside the record, principally to information about\nthe length of time that it takes to process a clearance application.  He argues that this lengthy\nprocessing time could result in the decline through misuse of particular skills that he possesses and\nthat he would like to be able to use in future employment.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant eligibility for Common\nAccess Card (CAC) credentialing.  On January 19, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013Misconduct or Negligence in Employment\nconcerns and Material, Intentional False Statement, Deception, or Fraud concerns, raised under the\nadjudicative standards in the appendices of DoD Instruction 5200.46 (Sep. 9, 2014) (Instruction). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On September 6, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for CAC\neligibility.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Instruction, Enclosure 4 \u00b6 6.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant claims that he was unaware of his right to be represented at the\nhearing and believes, if he had he been represented, the Judge would have decided the case in his\nfavor.  We do not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.  With the SOR, Applicant was provided\na copy of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended), which in \u00b6 E3.1.7\nsets forth his right to \u201cappear with or without counsel or a personal representative\u201d at the hearing. \nPrior to the hearing, Department Counsel also sent Applicant a letter that informed him that he could\nrepresent himself at the hearing, retain an attorney, or obtain the help of anyone else, such as a union\nrepresentative or family advisor.  Hearing Exhibit 4.  At the hearing, the Judge advised Applicant\nof his right to be represented by an attorney or personal representative at his own expense and\ninquired whether Applicant was going to represent himself.  Applicant responded to the Judge\u2019s\nquestion in the affirmative.  Tr. at 5-8.  We conclude that Applicant was properly advised of his right\nto be represented by an attorney at his own expense or by a personal representative, and he waived\nhis right to such representation. \nIn analyzing the concerns in Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge applied the wrong standard.  In both\nthe Policies and Conclusion sections of the Decision, the Judge cited to the \u201cclearly consistent with\nthe national interest\u201d standard required for security clearance determinations.1  The Policies section\nalso contains the following language: \u201cIn all adjudications, the protection of the national security\nis the paramount consideration. Therefore, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nCAC eligibility should be resolved in favor of national interest.\u201d  In a CAC case, however, the\nappropriate standard is whether the applicant\u2019s conduct poses an \u201cunacceptable risk.\u201d2  The\napplication of the wrong standard raises due process concerns and warrants corrective action.  Given\nthese circumstances, the best resolution is to remand the case to the Judge for correction of the\nidentified error and issuance of a new decision consistent with the requirements of the Instruction.\n1 Department of the Navy v.

On\nAugust 13, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On June 21, 2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence and, accordingly, was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, for such things as consumer purchases, child\nsupport payments, and Federal tax obligations.  The total amount of debt alleged in the SOR is about\n$57,500.  Applicant attributed his financial problems to inability to pay debts incurred during a\nmarriage and to a divorce.  His child support payments were increased significantly, which made it\ndifficult for him to pay his debts.  Applicant stated that his child support delinquency had been\nmensurably reduced through court-ordered wage garnishment and that his delinquent Federal tax\ndebt had been resolved through interception of his state tax refund.  He intends to file for bankruptcy\nin order to resolve his remaining financial problems.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors characterize him as reliable and trustworthy.  They state that he has\nan excellent work record and that he exercises sound judgment.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant has shown a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent\ndebts.  \u201cHe is or has filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and the debts listed in the SOR will or have been\ndischarged.\u201d  Decision at 6.  She stated that Applicant had not incurred new debt, thereby\ndemonstrating that his financial problems are being resolved.  \u201cIn the event that Applicant does not\nfollow through with his plan to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and to have each of the debts listed in\nthe SOR discharged that have not been paid, his security clearance will be in immediate jeopardy.\u201d \nId.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure\n2 \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Decision fails to address significant aspects of the record. \nShe cites to such things as the timing of Applicant\u2019s efforts at debt resolution, the involuntariness\nof his child support and Federal tax payments, and the speculative nature of the Judge\u2019s analysis,\nwhich, she contends, undercut the Judge\u2019s favorable results.  We find Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument to be persuasive.\n   The concern under Guideline F is not simply that an applicant might be tempted to\ncompromise classified information in order to pay his or her debts.  A Judge should also consider\nthe extent to which an applicant\u2019s financial problems cast doubt upon his or her judgment, self-\ncontrol, and other characteristics essential to protecting national security information.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  This obligation is rooted in the language\nof the Directive, which states that failure to meet financial obligations may indicate unwillingness\nto abide by rules and regulations, thereby raising questions about an applicant\u2019s ability to protect\nclassified information.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18; see ISCR Case No. 15-01737 at 3 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 14,  2017).  \nWhen an applicant\u2019s record contains evidence that raises security concerns, such as\nsignificant, longstanding delinquent debts, the applicant bears the burden of persuasion that he or\nshe should receive a favorable adjudication, under the standard set forth in Egan, supra.  In the case\nbefore us, Applicant\u2019s debts raise concerns, as the Judge found.  However, those aspects of the case\nto which Department Counsel draws our attention detract from the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis.  For\nexample, the timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to bear in evaluating\nan applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after\nhaving been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and\n3\n\nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).  \nAs Department Counsel notes, Applicant\u2019s financial problems go as far back as 2012. \nHowever, he did not engage the services of a lawyer for the purpose of filing for bankruptcy\nprotection until three months after receipt of the SOR and after he had received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM).  As Department Counsel argues,\nApplicant stated on two occasions\u2013first in his March 2017 security clearance\napplication and again in his September 2018 Answer to the SOR\u2013that he planned to\nfile bankruptcy to discharge [his] debts.  However, he did not hire a bankruptcy\nattorney until November 9, 2018, i.e., after he received the Government\u2019s October\n30, 2018 FORM.  As such, it is clear that Applicant did not take any active measures\ntowards resolving his delinquencies even after the SOR placed him on notice. \nAppeal Brief at 8.\nAccordingly, the timing of Applicant\u2019s hiring of an attorney raises questions about his willingness\nto follow rules or regulations when his interests are not at stake, a matter that the Judge failed to\naddress in her analysis.  This failure impairs her overall conclusions. \nMoreover, as of the close of the record, Applicant had not filed for bankruptcy protection. \nAny discharge of financial obligations resulting from this procedure would come to fruition well into\nthe future.  Promises to pay or otherwise resolve delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute\nfor a track record of paying debts in a timely manner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible\nmanner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015).  Nevertheless, the\nJudge\u2019s analysis appears to contravene this requirement, in that she founded it, in large measure,\nupon the assumption that Applicant would file for bankruptcy after the close of the record, stating\nthat should he not do so his access to classified information would be in immediate jeopardy.  The\nspeculative nature of this analysis underscores the paucity of actual, concrete evidence of debt\nresolution or of a track record of responsible action.  Insofar as Applicant bore the burden of\npersuasion, this paucity is a reason to conclude that he had failed to meet that burden, and it should\nhave been addressed forthrightly.\nWe also find persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the circumstances by which\nthe two debts that have been, or are being, resolved undercut the mitigating effect that the Judge\napparently assigned to them.  For example, Applicant\u2019s Federal tax delinquency was resolved not\nby Applicant\u2019s own considered action but, rather, by interception of a state tax refund.  In addition,\nApplicant\u2019s significant child-support arrearage has been reduced through wage garnishment.  Court-\nordered or otherwise involuntary means of debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less\nweight than means initiated and carried through by the debtor himself.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.  14-\n05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016).  \nIndeed, reliance upon garnishment, refund interception, or bankruptcy do not equate to good-\nfaith efforts by Applicant to resolve his financial problems, as the Judge concluded. The Directive\n4\n\ndoes not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d  However, we have stated that the concept of good faith\n\u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence honesty, and\nadherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than show that he or she relied on a legally available options\nsuch as garnishment and bankruptcy in order to receive the full benefit of Mitigating Condition\n20(d). (\u201c[T]he individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d)   See, e.g., ISCR Case No.12-01664 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014).\nIn summary, Applicant has had a significant amount of delinquent debt for a number of years,\ndebts which he only began seriously to address after receipt of the SOR and the FORM.  Much of\nthat debt he proposes to resolve through bankruptcy, although as of the close of the record he had\nnot filed, much less received discharge.  In addition, those debts that he has resolved were addressed\nthrough involuntary means such as wage garnishment.  Applicant\u2019s circumstances raise serious\nconcerns about his judgment and reliability, concerns which cannot be successfully mitigated by the\nrelative paucity of favorable evidence contained in the file.  The Judge\u2019s analysis fails to address\nimportant aspects of the case and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Accordingly,\nthe Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.    \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan           \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Character reference letters describe her as loyal, honest, professional, and patriotic.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant debts are recent and unresolved.  She failed to show her financial problems are\nunlikely to recur.  She addressed her medical debts, but failed to document her dispute of the credit\ndebt.  \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant argues that her husband opened accounts without her knowledge.  She further\ncontends the Judge erroneously found that she failed to substantiate that she had separated from her\nhusband.  With regard to these contentions, the Judge found:\nApplicant denied [the credit card] debts because she claimed that they all were\nopened by her husband using her credit information, social security number, and\nother personal identifying information without her permission.  She stated that\n2\n\nbecause of her religion and culture, she had no right to question her husband\u2019s\nhandling of their finances or use of the credit cards.  She acknowledged during her\nbackground interview that she was a cosigner on the accounts.  Credit reports also\nshow that the two largest credit cards delinquencies were opened before her marriage\nto her current husband.  She claims that she is separated from her husband and has\nmade efforts to contact the creditors to remove the accounts from her name.  She\nfailed to provide documentation supporting these assertions.1\nFrom our review of the record, substantial evidence supports the Judges\u2019s findings that Applicant\nacknowledged during a background interview that she was a cosigner on the two largest credit card\ndebts and those accounts were opened before her current marriage.2  File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) Items 3, 4, and 6.  One of her credit reports also lists the third credit card debt as an\n\u201cindividual account.\u201d  FORM Item 6.  Regarding her contention that the Judge did not accept her\nassertion that she had separated from her current husband, we note the contradiction in the evidence\nbetween her statements that her husband opened credit card accounts without her knowledge or\npermission and her acknowledgment in a background interview that she cosigned those accounts. \nResponse to FORM and FORM Item 4.  In a DOHA proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of\npersuasion that he or she should have access to classified information, and corroborating evidence\ncan go a long way toward enabling an applicant to meet that burden.  Given her above-noted\ninconsistent statements, it was not unreasonable for the Judge to expect Applicant to provide\ncorroboration to support her other claims.  He apparently did not find her uncorroborated assertions\nsufficiently credible to establish those claims, and we are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Furthermore, a Judge is not required to give\nconclusive weight to any kind of evidence, even if it is un-rebutted.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n02588 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2019).  Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful\nerror in his findings or conclusions. \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence,  mis-weighed\nthe evidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  For\nexample, she argues that she accumulated the debt due to periods of unemployment and that she\nacted responsibly in addressing her debts.  Her arguments, however, are neither sufficient to rebut\nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to show that\nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019).  We give due consideration to the\nHearing Office case that Applicant has cited in support of her arguments, but it is neither binding\nprecedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id. \n1 Decision at 3.  \n2 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n16-01329 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr 11, 2018).   We are unable to find that Applicant acknowledged in a background interview\nthat she was a cosigner for the smallest of the three delinquent credit card debts, but that apparent error was harmless\nbecause it likely did not affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).\n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

On\nJanuary 3, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March\n29, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nNichole L. Noel denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in her findings of\nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, his wife, his parents, and his three siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens originally\nfrom Pakistan.  Applicant and his wife have renounced their Pakistani citizenship and have no\nintention of returning there.  He has almost $400,000 in assets in the U.S., including a home.  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and two of his siblings reside in the United States.  For an unspecified\nperiod, his parents divided their time between the United States and Pakistan after retiring.  It is not\nclear when his parents began and ended that practice.  They maintain a home in Pakistan that they\nintend to leave to Applicant\u2019s younger sibling.  In 2009, the younger sibling returned to Pakistan and\ncurrently resides there.  Applicant has not had any contact with his younger sibling since he returned\nto Pakistan and considers his estrangement from this sibling permanent.  His parents maintain\ncontact with their child in Pakistan.  \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Pakistan.  He is currently in a school\nand is attempting to immigrate to the United States.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a permanent U.S.\nresident who returned to Pakistan in mid-2018 to wrap up family affairs, including selling the family\nhome.     \nTerrorist groups operate in Pakistan and may attack public places without warning.  They\nhave targeted U.S. citizens.  Citing terrorism, the U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to\nreconsider traveling to Pakistan.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents, younger sibling,\nmother-in-law, and brother-in-law creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, etc.\nHis relationship with his parents and younger sibling also presents a potential conflict of interest with\nhis obligation to protect classified information.  Applicant mitigated the security concerns involving\nhis in-laws, but failed to mitigate those concerns arising from his parents and younger sibling. \nAlthough Applicant is estranged from his younger sibling, their family ties are not entirely broken. \nThe parents remain a influence in the lives of Applicant and his younger sibling.  Noting that\n2\n\nApplicant did not ask his parents for information about the younger sibling\u2019s current circumstances,\nthe Judge stated, \u201cThe absence of information about Applicant\u2019s [younger sibling], and the extent\nof their parent\u2019s relationship with [that sibling], prevents application of any of the foreign influence\nmitigating conditions to this relationship.\u201d  Decision at 6.  \nDiscussion\nAs a preliminary matter, Applicant\u2019s brief discusses Guideline language that has not been\napplicable for more than a decade.  We will not speculate why he relies on inapplicable guidelines.\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that the evidence is not clear when his parents\nstopped the practice of spending part of each year in Pakistan.  He argues that he submitted an\naffidavit (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit CC) that \u201cclearly states they have stopped this practice.\u201d  Appeal Brief\nat 1.  In pertinent part, the affidavit states \u201cfor the past few years\u201d his parents have been spending\npart of the year in Pakistan, but it does not specify when that practice ended.  Consequently, the\naffidavit does not undermine the Judge\u2019s challenged finding, but rather supports it.\n  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant highlights a number of facts from his security clearance\napplication, testimony, and background investigation.  By doing so, he has not rebutted the\npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n15-01717 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2017).  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the absence of evidence about his younger\nsibling in Pakistan hinders the application of pertinent mitigating conditions.  He argues that he did\nnot provide such information at the hearing because he was trying to minimize his relationship with\nhis sibling in order to reduce foreign influence concerns.  In his brief,  he relates information that he\nobtained from his parents about his sibling that is not in the record.  Such information constitutes\nnew evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Based on\nour review of the record, Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge erred in concluding that the\nsecurity concerns involving his parents and younger sibling were not mitigated.   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a challenge of the Judge\u2019s weighing the\nevidence.  These arguments are not enough to show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 15-01717, supra, at 4.\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant served in the military from 2004 until his honorable discharge in 2011.  He has\nheld a clearance, though with some breaks, since 2004.  He has a master\u2019s degree.  Applicant\nsmoked marijuana regularly before joining the military.  He smoked it once while on active duty and\nresumed using it after his discharge.  Some instances of marijuana use occurred while Applicant held\na security clearance, and he used it while working in Europe and while performing duties in the\nMiddle East.  Applicant disclosed his drug use in security clearance applications (SCA) completed\nin March and August of 2014.  He stated that he did not intend to use marijuana again because it was\nnot consistent with his employment or clearance eligibility.  He reiterated this intention during\nclearance interviews in May and October 2014.\nIn late 2015, Applicant consumed food that he knew contained marijuana.  Early the next\nyear he smoked marijuana.  He reported this use on an April 2016 SCA.  During a subsequent\ninterview, he stated that he liked marijuana and would continue smoking it if it were not forbidden\nby his job and by the requirements of his security clearance.  Applicant has not used marijuana since\nhis use in early 2016.  He testified that he will not use it again, and he signed a statement of intent\nto refrain from the use of illegal drugs, acknowledging that such conduct will be grounds for\nrevoking his clearance.\nThe Judge stated that Applicant was honest and credible.  However, he stated that Applicant\nwas also sincere in 2014 when he made a prior promise to refrain from drug use, a promise that he\ndid not keep.  He concluded that Applicant\u2019s misconduct creates a potential for exploitation and\nreflects poorly on his judgment.\nDiscussion\nApplicant cites to record evidence that he contends the Judge did not consider, such as his\nyears of abstinence from drug use, his forthright disclosures of his misconduct, his honesty, etc. \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the\nrecord, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Department Counsel appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence and, therefore, was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born and raised in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese descent.  She came to the\nU.S. in the late 1990s to attend college, eventually earning a master\u2019s degree.  She became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in the early 2000s and is married with two children.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\nwho lives in Hong Kong.  Her father, father-in-law, and mother-in-law are PRC citizens who live\nin Hong Kong.

She\nprovides no assistance to her family members in Hong Kong.  She has no contact with a foreign\ngovernment, nor does she have financial interests in Hong Kong.

She has worked in the U.S. for several years and professes no allegiance,\nsympathy, or alliance with any other country.\nSince July 1997, Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, which\nhas given it considerable autonomy.  The PRC retains responsibility for defense and foreign policy,\nalthough it has recently undertaken a more active oversight role in Hong Kong\u2019s politics. \nNevertheless, the Basic Law provides safeguards for Hong Kong, and it remains a free and open\n2\n\nstate.  Hong Kong is active in counter terrorism initiatives, and the U.S. has a strong trade surplus\nwith it.  \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s most populous country and is undergoing rapid economic and social\nchange.  It is authoritarian and possesses an increasingly sophisticated military.  Although not viewed\nas hostile to the U.S., the PRC is competitive.  It is one of the most active collectors of U.S.\neconomic and proprietary information, and it has a poor human rights record.  There have been\nincreasing incidents of harassment, arrest, and imprisonment of writers, journalists, lawyers, etc.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s family connections in Hong Kong pose a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, pressure, and/or coercion.  He also concluded that these connections\ncould pose a conflict between Applicant\u2019s interest in protecting U.S. security information and her\ninterest in helping her foreign family members.  Therefore, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nconnections in Hong Kong raise security concerns.\nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, he cited to Hong Kong\u2019s history as a British\ncolony.  He concluded that the citizenship status of her relatives posed minimal risks, due to\nApplicant\u2019s strong loyalties within the U.S.  He concluded that Applicant is not in a position to be\ncoerced or subjected to pressure and that her ties in the U.S. are such that she can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\n3\n\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s decision runs contrary to the weight both of the\nrecord evidence and of the official notice documents that the Judge admitted.  She notes that official\npronouncements by the President, State Department, Department of Defense, or other appropriate\nfederal agency on matters of national security are legislative facts for purposes of DOHA\nadjudications and must govern a Judge\u2019s analysis.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-04786 at 5,  n.6\n(App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003).  She argues that Applicant\u2019s connections to Hong Kong, understood in the\ncontext of the geopolitical circumstances of that region as expressed in the official notice documents,\nundermine the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.  We find this argument to be persuasive.\nThe general principles guiding Foreign Influence analysis are found in Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 6:\nForeign contacts and interests . . . are a national security concern if they result in\ndivided allegiance.  They may also be a national security concern if they create\ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S.\ninterests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAssessment of foreign contacts . . . should consider the country in which the foreign\ncontact . . .  is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether\nit is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information[.]\nThe current language cited above is consistent with prior guideline language regarding\nidentity of the country concerned.  Thus, our prior cases on that subject remains valid.  In applying\nthe pertinent security concern, we have stated that the nature of the foreign government involved and\nthe intelligence gathering history of that government are among the important considerations that\nprovide context for the record evidence and that must be brought to bear upon the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nconclusions.  The country\u2019s human rights record is also significant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017).  An applicant\u2019s family members living in a foreign country are\namong the contacts and interests within the scope of this concern.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003).  In-laws represent a class of persons contemplated by the Directive\nas entailing possible security risk.  As a matter of common sense, we presume that a person has ties\nof affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family of his or her spouse.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-03112 at 3, n.1 (App. Bd. Nov. 3. 2015).   \nWith this in mind, we note the following matters, drawn from the Judge\u2019s decision and from\nthe record:\n4\n\nHong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the PRC, which exercises\nsovereignty.  The PRC has responsibility for its defense and for foreign relations. \nApplicant Exhibit (AE B), U.S. Relations with Hong Kong, July 17, 2018, at 1.\nPersons of Chinese descent born in Hong Kong are citizens of the PRC.  Decision at\n4.  Therefore, Applicant\u2019s spouse, parents, siblings and in-laws are PRC citizens.  \nThe PRC has recently taken actions that were not consistent with the high degree of\nautonomy contained in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law.  AE D, Hong Kong Policy Act\nReport, May 29, 2018, at 1.\nThe PRC has emphasized that Hong Kong Basic Law is subordinate to the mainland\nconstitution.  It has also stated that the PRC will decide \u201csome important matters,\u201d\nblurring the distinction that the Basic Law requires.  AE D at 4.\nThe PRC is the world\u2019s most active and persistent practitioner of economic\nespionage.  Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1, Item III, Annual Report to Congress, Military\nand Security Developments Involving the People\u2019s Republic of China 2012.\nThe U.S. \u201cfaces a large and growing threat to its national security from [PRC]\nintelligence collection operations.  Among the most serious threats are [the PRC\u2019s]\nefforts at cyber and human infiltration of U.S. national security organizations.\u201d  HE\n1, Item XII, USCC 2016 Annual Report at 289. \nThe PRC is an authoritarian state with significant human rights problems.  HE 1,\nItem XIII, 2017 Human Rights Report Regarding the PRC.  \nForeign visitors may be placed under surveillance, including the monitoring of\nelectronic communications.  HE 1, Item XIV, U.S. Department of State Bureau of\nConsular Affairs Report. Applicant has traveled to Hong Kong several times in the\npast to visit family members. Decision at 4.\nWe are persuaded by Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the PRC\nseems to have underestimated the geopolitical threat posed to the U.S. by that country.  Whether or\nnot actively hostile actions, such as military conflict, have broken out or are imminent, any country\nwhose policies consistently threaten U.S. national security may be viewed as hostile for purposes of\nnational security adjudications, such as DOHA proceedings.  Viewed in that light, we note that an\napplicant having relatives in a country hostile of the U.S. is one reason explicitly cited by the\nSupreme Court for denying a clearance.  Egan, at 529.  Following this, we have regularly held that\nthere is a rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are\nadverse to the U.S. and the risk that the applicant might fail to protect classified information.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3.  An applicant who has relatives in a hostile country has a \u201cvery\nheavy burden\u201d of persuasion as to mitigation.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-12172 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\n5\n\nJan. 9, 2014).  We note the Judge\u2019s findings that Hong Kong was for many years a British colony. \nThe security significance of a given locale must be evaluated in light of current geopolitical\ncircumstances rather than those that existed in years past.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-04980 at 6\n(App. Bd. Sep. 12. 2012) regarding the necessity of an accurate assessment of a country\u2019s\ngeopolitical situation.     \nGiven the totality of the evidence described above, as well as the Judge\u2019s own finding that\nApplicant\u2019s circumstances raise security concerns, we conclude that his favorable mitigation analysis\nis not sustainable.  Contrary to the Judge\u2019s analysis, it is forseeable that Applicant\u2019s family could be\na means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those in the PRC who are devoted to\nacquiring U.S. protected information, especially in light of her regular contact with her mother.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03112 at 4. This is in no way an assertion that Applicant is disloyal or is\nlacking in character.  We note the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant has not engaged in illegal activity\nnor evidenced disloyalty to the U.S.  We are not holding these findings to be erroneous.  Neither are\nwe asserting that Applicant\u2019s family members are untrustworthy.  Rather, we conclude that these\nmatters are beside the point, under the facts of this case.  Even a person of the highest character can\nexperience circumstances under which he or she could be tempted to place the well-being of foreign\nrelatives over the interests of the U.S.  Id.  Our decision in this case is simply a conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to meet her \u201cvery heavy  burden\u201d of persuasion as to\nmitigation.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision runs contrary to the weight of the record\nevidence and fails to consider important aspects of the case.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-02058\n(App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006), which cited to Hong Kong\u2019s status as a region within the PRC that posed\nsecurity concerns for an applicant with a relative there. \n6\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \n  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 22, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 9, 2018, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Caroline E. Heintzelman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings contained\nerrors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is 55 years old.  He held a DoD security clearance from about 1985 until 2013. \nHe has a master\u2019s degree.  In late 2013, Applicant was debriefed from his TS/SCI clearance and\ndowngraded to unclassified access.  This was based upon a pending incident report concerning an\nallegation of domestic assault.1  He was told that he could not perform classified work and had to\nbe debriefed from any special access programs.  Before this debriefing, Applicant had worked at\nthree different sites.  One of the sites was the clearance authority for all three, and employees were\nissued a single badge to be used at all sites.  In addition, Applicant had a classified badge from a\nprevious job that he had not turned in before moving to another state.  This badge was not valid at\nthe sites at issue in this case.\nAs stated above, Applicant was debriefed on a special program upon which he was working. \nThis occurred at site 1.  He then went to site 2 and met with the Facility Security Officer (FSO), who\ntold him that there was still jurisdiction for his clearance and that he would not be debriefed from\na program that he was working on there.  However, later that day, he was advised by an FSO at site\n1 that he was in a \u201cno determination\u201d status and that he had to re-sign the debriefing documents. \nIt was not clear to Applicant whether he had a clearance or not.\nEven later the same day, Applicant attended a meeting at site 1.  At this meeting, the other\npersons in attendance discussed classified matters in Applicant\u2019s presence.  Applicant did not report\nthis to the appropriate FSO, nor did he advise other people at the meeting that there were possible\nproblems with his clearance.  Applicant testified that he had been told that his clearance was in a \u201cno\ndetermination\u201d status prior to attending this meeting. \nThe next day, Applicant re-signed the debriefing documents.  The documents stated, in\npertinent part, the following:\n1This case was eventually closed after Applicant agreed to attend family counseling.  Decision at 2.\n2\n\nThis debriefing is executed because you no longer have a continuing need for access\nto classified information at [company] and does not reflect a negative security\nprofile.  Document Control has checked your accountability for classified holdings\nand by execution of this debriefing you certify that you do not have any non-\naccountable classified material in your possession.  Once you sign this debriefing,\nyour access to classified information will terminate.  Decision at 3-4.\nApplicant was issued a non-classified badge.  He did not turn in the invalid classified badge\nthat he had retained from his previous employment.  He did not advise security officials at each of\nthe three sites where he worked that he had received conflicting information about the status of his\nclearance.  Moreover, he did not include this matter in the statements that he made during a\nsubsequent inquiry concerning his alleged security violations.\nAfter his second debriefing, Applicant continued to work at both classified and unclassified\ntasks and attended multiple meetings in which participants discussed classified information.  He\nwore the invalid classified badge at these meetings in order to avoid questions about the status of\nhis clearance.  He stated that he did not want to have to explain to his colleagues why he had only\nan unclassified badge.\nApplicant testified that he had never worn his invalid classified badge at site 1.  This is not\nconsistent with statements that he made during the inquiry.  This badge allowed him access to\nclassified areas, and he would wear it over his unclassified badge to give the impression that he had\nan active clearance.  \u201cHe did this fourteen times between October 10 and October 29, 2013.  While\nin the secret-closed area, Applicant logged onto a classified network system eleven times between\nOctober 18 and October 29, 2013, logging 499 minutes.\u201d  Decision at 4.  Applicant did not advise\nhis supervisor where his classified badge came from, and he did not seek clarification of the status\nof his clearance.\nEventually his FSO advised him that he did not have access to classified information.  He\nfelt remorse for his conduct and advised officials to pull his name from the program access list.  By\nthis time his domestic assault charge had been dropped, and Applicant believed that his clearance\nwould soon be restored.  In addition to his inconsistent statements, during his clearance interview\nin December 2013, he said nothing about his purported confusion as to the status of his clearance\ndue to conflicting guidance.  During the inquiry that his company conducted in connection with\nApplicant\u2019s conduct, he provided several explanations: he was afraid of losing his job, the stigma\nof not having a clearance, and to escape personal issues outside the company.\nBefore the matters at issue here, Applicant had committed no security infractions or\nviolations, and he had received regular security training.  He testified that he should not have done\nwhat he did and that it was a mistake.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n3\n\nThe Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s last incident was nearly five years in the past.  However,\nshe concluded that, given the seriousness of the misconduct, it still raised questions about his\nreliability, trustworthiness, and reliability.  She cited to evidence of Applicant\u2019s age at the time of\nhis offenses and to his having held a clearance for many years.  She stated that Applicant had not\nmentioned any confusion as to the status of his clearance during his December 2013 interview and\nthat there is no evidence that he brought this issue to the attention of his employer during the\ninquiry.  She found that Applicant\u2019s disclosures of his misconduct were not prompt.  In evaluating\nGuideline E, the Judge characterized Applicant\u2019s excuses as those of \u201csomeone who places his own\nego over the well-being of the national interest.\u201d  Decision at 10.  She stated that he minimized his\nerrors and has taken no positive steps to reduce his vulnerability to manipulation or duress.\nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings about the extent to which he knew, or should have\nknown, that he did not have access to classified information during the course of his misconduct. \nHe contends that the Judge did not consider, or that she mis-weighed, evidence that he had received\nconflicting guidance about his access to classified information.  We have examined the Decision in\nlight of the entirety of the record.  The Judge made findings about Applicant\u2019s claim, and she\ndiscussed these findings in the Analysis.  That Applicant knew, or reasonably should have known,\nthat he did not have access to classified information is born out by the content of the inquiry report,\namong other things.2  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of\nthe evidence in the record.  Neither has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJan. 15, 2019).  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported\nby \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nApplicant has cited to a Hearing Office case that he believes supports his effort to obtain a\nfavorable result.  We give due consideration to this case.  However, each case must be decided on\nits own merits.  Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges or on\nthe Appeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01077 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2018).  There are\nsignificant differences between the cited case and the one at issue here, including the multiple nature\nof Applicant\u2019s misconduct and an absence of reasonable mistake.  Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that he lacked credibility.  We give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  In the case before us, the Judge\u2019s findings about Applicant\u2019s inconsistent\nstatements undermine Applicant\u2019s claim that he was honestly confused about the status of his\nclearance and support her adverse credibility determination.  We find no reason to disturb the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s presentation lacked credibility.  Id.\n2\u201c[Applicant] admitted holding onto an old Top Secret [employer] badge and using that badge to give the\nappearance he was still cleared Top Secret when meeting with [colleague] . . . [Applicant] stated that a good portion of\nthe conversation with [colleague] on 13 January 2014 was classified.\u201d  Government Exhibit 2, Inquiry Report, at 2-3. \n4\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  Once it is established that an applicant has committed a security violation, he or she has\na \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d of persuasion as to mitigation.  Such violations \u201cstrike at the heart of the\nindustrial security program.\u201d  Id.

On\nJanuary 30, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nFebruary 28, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nhis foreign contacts raised security concerns and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nBorn in Nigeria, Applicant came to the U.S. in the late 2000s, where he obtained a college\ndegree.  He became a U.S. citizen about five years ago.  His parents are citizens and residents of\nNigeria, and his mother is a retiree of the Nigerian government.  Applicant\u2019s four siblings are\ncitizens of Nigeria, and three of them reside there as well.  One sibling worked for the Nigerian\ngovernment in a job that placed him in contact with high-ranking officials.  Applicant contacts his\nrelatives by phone or text from biweekly to monthly and traveled to Nigeria in 2013 and 2016.\nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality of his duty performance.  \nNigeria is challenged by sectarian, religious, and ethnic violence.  Terrorist groups are active\nthroughout the country.  Organizations such as Boko Haram and ISIS operate in Nigeria and attack\npolice, military personnel, and U.S. citizens and interests.  Applicant stated that most terrorist\nactivity occurs in a different part of Nigeria from where his family resides and which he has visited. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s ongoing contact with his family members in Nigeria \nand his recent travels there create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or coercion.  His Nigerian\ncontacts could become a basis for him to be placed in a conflict of interest.  She also concluded that\nApplicant has not demonstrated sufficient connections within the U.S. that would outweigh his\nhistory and family connections in Nigeria.\nIn her whole-person analysis, the Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s clean security record and a lack\nof questionable conduct by him.  However, she found there to be \u201csignificant potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress[.]\u201d  Decision at 7.  Accordingly, she concluded that Applicant had\nnot met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.    \n2\n\nDiscussion\nThe Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that his connections within Nigeria raise\nsecurity concerns.  He argues that his circumstances are \u201c\u2018normal results of [his] family situation.\u2019\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 3.  He argues that he has never demonstrated questionable conduct, that he has no\nfinancial interests in Nigeria, and that he has never taken action that would cause harm to the U.S.\nThe Directive presumes that there is a nexus between proved or admitted conduct or\ncircumstances under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to national\nsecurity information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02595 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) .  We note\nthe Judge\u2019s finding about Applicant\u2019s claim that his relatives live in part of the country where\nterrorist activity is less likely to occur.  However, we also note the following findings: Applicant has\nclose family members in Nigeria; terrorist activity occurs in Nigeria; the Nigerian government has\na poor human rights record; and Applicant\u2019s sibling recently worked in a governmental position in\nclose proximity to high-ranking officials.  These findings, viewed in light of the record as a whole,\nsupport her conclusion that Applicant\u2019s family connections pose a heightened risk that he could\ncome to the attention of those seeking access to U.S. classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017).1  Applicant\u2019s appeal arguments do not provide a reason\nto rebut the presumption of nexus.\nApplicant argues that he has never taken any action that would harm the U.S. and that he has\nno property or financial interests in Nigeria, etc.  However, the Government need not wait until a\nperson has actually engaged in conduct adverse to U.S. interests before it can deny a security\nclearance.  Even those with good security records can encounter circumstances in which they could\nbe subjected to pressure or find themselves in a conflict between their own legitimate interests and\nthe security interests of the U.S.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2019). \nApplicant\u2019s appeal arguments consist, in large measure, of a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  Such arguments are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in\na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at\n2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\n1\u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard to meet.  It is a risk that is greater than the normal risk inherent in\nhaving a family member living under a foreign government.  Depending on the circumstances of a case, one or more\nforeign contacts even in a country that is friendly to the U.S. may create a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019).  We note the\nJudge\u2019s finding that terrorist activity occurs throughout Nigeria.  The official notice documents submitted by the\nGovernment assert that Boko Haram and ISIS conduct terrorist activity in northern Nigeria.  See, e.g., Country Reports\non Terrorism 2016.  However, we do not construe the official notice documents to mean that persons in other parts of\nNigeria are not also at some substantial risk of terrorist activity.  In any event, even if the Judge\u2019s finding was somewhat\noverbroad, it did not likely affect the overall outcome of the case.   \n3\n\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that\na clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 26, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nIn the appeal brief, Applicant contends she timely and properly submitted documents into\nthe record that were not received or considered by the Judge.1  The documents in question are a\nsubstance abuse evaluation and the evaluator\u2019s professional credentials.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel had\nnot received these documents before the hearing and just became aware of them at or before the\nhearing.  During the hearing, Applicant\u2019s Co-Counsel, who was not present at the hearing, emailed\nthe documents to Department Counsel and the Judge.  At that time, the Judge and parties were\nunaware that they had been transmitted.  The record of the proceeding was left open for 10 days for\nApplicant to submit additional documents.  While the record remained open, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nadvised Department Counsel through an email that she was offering into evidence the documents\nthat had been transmitted the week earlier.  The documents were not attached to that email because\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel already believed Department Counsel and the Judge had them.  Department\nCounsel later emailed the Judge advising that the record could be closed with the introduction of the\nevaluation into evidence.\nAfter reading the Judge\u2019s decision, Applicant\u2019s Counsel emailed him expressing concern that\nthe evaluation had not been considered.  The Judge responded: \nI do not have any record of receiving the [name omitted] evaluation document from \n[Department Counsel].  I did receive an e-mail on November 7, 2018, from\n[Applicant\u2019s Co-Counsel] with the documents attached.  It was not sent through\ndepartment counsel by you as a formal post-hearing document, so it was not\nconsidered in my decision.2  \n1 The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However,\nwe can consider new evidence to address the threshold issues of jurisdiction and due process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).   In this case, while some representations of the parties in their briefs as well as\ndocuments attached thereto constitute new evidence, we will consider those matters in analyzing the due process issue\nthat has been raised.  \n2 Applicant\u2019s Supplemental Submission, i.e., Judge\u2019s email of Mar. 11, 2019, and Reply Brief at 4.  In the Reply\nBrief, Department Counsel expresses dissatisfaction, as an opposing party in the proceeding, with serving as an agent\nor a conduit for the submission of an applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission.  Department Counsel notes that this practice\nadds an unnecessary layer to the post-hearing submission process and creates a possible basis for accusations of due\nprocess violations.  We concur with Department Counsel contention that \u201c[a] far better practice, consistent with other\ncourts and administrative bodies, would be that, when the record is left open, documents are sent directly to the\nAdministrative Judge with a copy to the Department Counsel for review and possible objection.\u201d  Reply Brief at 7.    \n2\n\nDepartment Counsel concurs with Applicant\u2019s request to remand the case to the Judge for\nconsideration of the documents in question.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nFebruary 13, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On October 11, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is single, never married, and has one child.  A high school graduate, she has taken\nsome college courses.  She has worked for a Federal contractor since August 2016.\nThe SOR alleged 45 delinquent accounts and a judgment against Applicant.  Most of these\nwere for medical expenses, several of which were under $25 and some were for as little as $1. \nDuring her clearance interview, Applicant stated that she had been the only wage earner in the\nhousehold.  It is not clear how many were in the household, although it included at least Applicant,\nher child, and a co-habitant.  There is no evidence in the record regarding Applicant\u2019s current\nfinancial standing.  She provided a written statement to the effect that she recently received a\n$25,000 pay increase.  Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR stated that two debts had been paid.  One of\nthem, however, was included in a recent credit report as still being past due in the amount of $52. \nApplicant did not provide documentation to show any payments or payment plans for her delinquent\ndebts.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and unresolved.  He states that she\nprovided insufficient evidence on the question of whether her problems are likely to recur. \nApplicant failed to demonstrate responsible action in regard to her debts, and she did not show\nresolution of the SOR debts except for one.1  The Judge concluded that Applicant had not\nestablished a track record of financial stability.\nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings.  She notes, for example, that she has two\nchildren rather than one.  Item 3, Security Clearance Application, at 24-25.  This error is harmless,\nin that the Judge would likely have arrived at the same ultimate conclusions even if he had not made\nthe error.  Applicant argues that she is paying on the account that the Judge found to be worth $52. \n1The Judge also found in favor of Applicant on four accounts that were duplicated in the SOR.\n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s findings on this matter are consistent with the record that was before him.  She argues\nthat she has paid two debts and that the total of unresolved obligations is 43 rather than 45. \nHowever, the challenged finding merely refers to the number of allegations in the SOR, not the\nnumber that the Judge found to have been unresolved.  The Judge\u2019s material findings are supported\nby substantial evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 17-02145 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  Applicant has\ncited to no harmful error in the findings.  \nApplicant asks for an opportunity to submit additional documentary evidence regarding debt\nresolution and the whole person factors.  We construe her argument to be that she was not aware that\nshe should present documentary evidence on these things.2  We cannot receive new evidence on\nappeal.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 5, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing.  On May 9, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson  denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on one Guideline\nE allegation that has not been raised an as issue on appeal and is not discussed further below. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s adverse decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant is married and has a child.  He has previously worked for defense contractors and\nheld a security clearance for a number of years.  In 2015, he was arrested on a felony charge of\npossession of child pornography.  His bond was set at $250,000.  He remained in jail for three weeks\nuntil he was able to make bail.  He admits being arrested and admits looking at pornography on his\ncomputer but denies ever intentionally or accidentally looking at pornographic images of minors. \nBefore his attorneys were able to review the evidence against him, the district attorney (DA) offered\nto dismiss the charge conditioned upon him participating in a pretrial intervention program that\nincluded his attendance at weekly meetings of the state\u2019s sex offender group treatment program for\ntwo years and his payment of court costs.  Applicant accepted the offer and the charges were\ndismissed.  He completed the sex offender treatment program in a year and a half.  He denied\nreceiving a diagnosis during the treatment program or being required to register as a sex offender.\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated that, on the day of his arrest, the police arrived at his\nhouse with a search warrant.  They confiscated his home computer and other items.  He also stated\nthat he accepted the DA\u2019s offer because he wanted the matter over as quickly as possible and did not\nhave the financial resources to fight the charge.  He acknowledged that the DA did not dismiss the\ncharge outright and that it could have been refiled if he did not meet the conditions of the pretrial\nintervention program.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cApplicant has continued to deny that the material confiscated by the police involved child\npornography, despite the fact he was arrested after the police executed a search warrant at his home.\u201d \nDecision at 7.  The Judge found Applicant\u2019s denials of viewing child pornography to be\nunpersuasive.   Moreover, there is no evidence to support his contention that the authorities did not\nhave grounds to pursue criminal charges against him.  While he completed a year-and-a-half of\ntreatment program and informed his wife and current employer about the circumstance of his arrest,\nthose factors are not enough for a favorable finding.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant continues to deny he viewed or possessed illegal pornography. \nHe essentially contends that there was insufficient evidence in the record to prove the SOR\nallegations that he possessed child pornography.  We do not find his argument persuasive.  \nFirst,  Applicant was arrested at his home after the police executed a search warrant during\nwhich they seized his computer and other items.  He was charged with felony possession of child\npornography, placed in jail on a $250,000 bond, and remained there for three weeks until he could\nmake bail.  Second, Applicant admits he viewed pornography on his computer.  Third, at the hearing,\nDepartment Counsel offered into evidence Government Exhibit 3 that included a deposition signed\nby a police officer (but not sworn) that reflects Applicant \u201cdownloaded several images and videos\ndepicting child sexual abuse\u201d at a particular time in November 2015 and also included an unsigned\nWarrant Affidavit for Applicant\u2019s arrest that includes a probable cause statement using similar\nlanguage.  Fourth, it is fair to say that the executed search warrant would have been supported by a\nprobable cause determination, i.e., a reasonable basis for believing that evidence of a crime would\nbe found in the place to be searched.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00541at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 28,\n2018) and ISCR Case No. 08-08831 at 4 (Jan. 4, 2011).  Fifth, Applicant accepted the DA\u2019s offer\nto dismiss the charge contingent upon him participating in a two-year sex offender treatment\nprogram and paying the court costs.  Sixth, there is nothing in the record to suggest any irregularity\nin the processing of the case in question.  See, e.g., U.S. v. Wilson, 169 F.3d 418, 425 (7th Cir. 1999);\nHoneycutt v. Ward, 612 F.2d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 1979) (There is a strong presumption of regularity in\nstate judicial proceedings).  Viewed in its entirety, the record contains substantial evidence to\nestablish security concerns under Guidelines D and E for the SOR allegations involving Applicant\u2019s\npossession of child pornography.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018). \nIn his brief, Applicant presents other arguments that lack merit.  For example, he highlights\nin his arguments his positive character evidence, including his professional accomplishments, his\npast record of protecting classified information, and his service to the community.  We note the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security\nclearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 29, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Initially electing a decision on the\nwritten record, Applicant later requested a hearing.  On January 23, 2019, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is 60 years old, has been working for a Federal contractor since 2016.  He\nexperienced periods of unemployment and underemployment.  His current annual salary is about\n$120,000.  The SOR alleged five delinquent debts.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on three\nof those debts and against him on the other two.\nThe largest debt that the Judge found against Applicant was for about $46,900.  Applicant\ndid not disclose that debt on his 2017 security clearance application.  In a background interview, he\ntold an investigator that his failure to disclose the debt was an error, that he believed the debt was\nan equity loan on a former home disposed of through a short sale in 2014, and that he intended to\nreach a settlement with the creditor as soon as possible.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant denied\nthis debt and indicated he had no recollection of it.  He also noted the debt no longer appears on his\ncredit report and his preliminary investigation showed the debt to be at least ten years old.  He\nasserted there was no legal advantage in disputing the debt because it was beyond the statute of\nlimitations.  At the hearing, he stated the debt did not belong to him, indicated he was not going to\ndispute a ten-year-old debt, and admitted he worried about resetting the statute of limitations.  He\npursued the short sale of the home because he had trouble making the mortgage payments and was\nliving off of credit cards.  He stated that, based on the amount of the debt, he believed it was likely\nthe equity loan.  \nThe other debt that the Judge found against Applicant was for $88.  Applicant claimed he\nhad no recollection of this debt.  He decided not to pursue this debt because it is no longer listed on\nhis credit report.  He also stated that he has another account with this creditor who had no record of\nhim having an unpaid account.  The record also reflects that Applicant had six non-alleged debts\ntotaling over $29,700 that creditors cancelled by issuing IRS Forms 1099-C.  \n\u201cApplicant made numerous inconsistent statements in his government interview, answer to\nthe SOR, and testimony.  I did not find him credible.\u201d  Decision at 6.  There is insufficient evidence\nto conclude his financial problems are unlikely to recur.  He has not acted responsibly regarding his\ndebts.  His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant notes that the largest debt was reported by only one credit\nreporting agency on one credit report in the record.  He argues that it was reported on that credit\nreport through an error that has now been corrected.1  It is well settled, however, that adverse\ninformation from a credit report can normally meet the substantial evidence standard and the\nGovernment\u2019s obligations  under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010).  In this case, the Judge\u2019s adverse findings about the\nlargest debt are not only supported by that credit report but also by some of Applicant\u2019s inconsistent\nstatements in which he indicated the debt was likely a equity loan on his former home disposed of\nthrough a short sale.  In this regard, we note that it is a Judge\u2019s task to resolve apparent conflicts in\nthe evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014).  Based on the\nrecord evidence, the Judge\u2019s decision to discount Applicant\u2019s denial of the debt was not\nunreasonable.  Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge erred in her adverse findings regarding\nthat debt.2  \nIn his brief, Applicant also notes that he testified about having a checking account stolen\nfrom him.  He contends the Judge incorrectly found that he did not file a police report for the stolen\nchecks.  The transcript supports his contention that he testified about filing a police report.  Tr. at\n28.  He also challenges one of the Judge\u2019s findings about a debt in which she found in his favor. \nThese errors, however, were harmless because they did not likely affect on the outcome of the case. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.  25, 2013).     \nApplicant further contends that the Judge \u201cwent out of her way to discredit my integrity and\ncredibility based on her feelings to support her case and unreasonably denied all the factual\nevidence.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2-3.  To the extent that Applicant is contending the Judge was biased\nagainst him, we note there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and\na party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 12-01122 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2016).  Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is not sufficient\nto rebut the presumption the Judge was impartial.  Moreover, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 provides that we\nshall give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  The balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments\namount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are insufficient to establish\nthat she weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17, 03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019).  \n1 The fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent\nevidence as to the disposition of the debt.  Debts may fall off credit reports for various reasons, including the passage\nof time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019).    \n2 Applicant has similarly challenged the Judge\u2019s adverse finding regarding the smaller debt.  He argues that he\nwas unsuccessful in contacting the collection agency and the original creditor does not have a record of the debt.  These\narguments are not enough to establish the Judge committed any harmful error in her findings or conclusion regarding\nthat debt.  \n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

In\naddition to other positive traits, he is praised for his trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nConsidering all the evidence, including that Applicant\u2019s child never came to live with him\nand he accepted a discharge under other than honorable conditions in lieu of court-martial,\nsubstantial evidence exists that he knew the amendment was a fake when he submitted it, \nintentionally submitted false pay-entitlement documents, and knowingly received pay to which he\nwas not entitled.  His testimony and claims of innocence were also false.  \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that he acted in good-faith in believing his ex-wife\nfollowed proper procedures in obtaining the document in question and that he did not know that\ndocument was a fake.  The Judge analyzed this issue in detail.  While Applicant is challenging the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions regarding his knowledge about the legitimacy of the document and his state of\nmind in submitting the document to qualify for BAH and FSA, he does not dispute any of the\nJudge\u2019s specific findings of fact supporting those conclusions.  Knowledge and intent may be proven\nby circumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-0107 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2018). \nMoreover, we are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.   From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions about\nApplicant\u2019s alleged conduct are based on substantial record evidence or constitute reasonable\ninferences that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  In those arguments, for example, Applicant highlights his military service and his\ncharacter evidence.  Those arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption that\nthe Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has worked for his current employer since 2005 and has worked for Defense\ncontractors for about 30 years.  He served on active duty with the U.S. military from 1983 until\n1987.  Applicant has held a clearance for many years.  He has a history of financial problems, which\ninclude a tax lien as well as other delinquent debts.  The Judge found that Applicant had mitigated\nall but the tax lien, which is alleged in the amount of about $29,000.  Applicant attributed his\nfinancial problems to his wife having lost her job, to deaths of close family members, and to his\nhaving allowed his finances to get \u201cout of hand.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Applicant made a payment toward\nhis tax lien in 2018, and tax refunds were applied to this debt.  These are the only payments that\nApplicant has made.  Applicant\u2019s wife is working again.  She has filed a lawsuit and hopes to use\nthe settlement to pay the family\u2019s debts.  Applicant has not received financial counseling, although\nhe has hired tax professionals to help him address his problems.\nThe Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s tax problem precedes his wife\u2019s job loss and the deaths of\nhis relatives.  He found that Applicant still owes over $116,000 and that there is insufficient\nevidence that his problems are behind him or that he has acted responsibly in regard to his tax lien. \nHe found that Applicant\u2019s tax problem is recent and ongoing.

He cites to evidence of his wife\u2019s job loss, his mother\u2019s death, and his wife\u2019s\ncurrent employment.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of\nthe evidence in the record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan.\n15, 2019).  Applicant presented a subsequent appeal submission.  The Directive permits only one\nappeal brief by a party.

On December 14, 2018, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is 32 years old, has been working for a defense contractor since 2016.  He\nserved in the military for about nine years and received an honorable discharge in 2013.  After his\ndischarge, he experienced periods of unemployment.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file some of his Federal income tax returns in a\ntimely manner.  He filed his 2009 Federal tax return in January 2011, his 2011 return in September\n2018, and his 2014 return in July 2017.  He filed his other Federal income tax returns for 2007 to\n2017 in a timely manner, but owed an additional $5,000 in Federal taxes for 2013.1  His subsequent\nFederal tax refunds were applied to his 2013 tax deficiency, which is resolved.  Applicant also\nresolved two other alleged debts.  Because he was unable to obtain his W-2 for 2011, he had not\nfiled his 2011 state income tax return as of the date of the hearing.       \nIn his 2016 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant failed to disclose that he did not\ntimely file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2011.  He indicated that he had forgotten that\nhe did not file his tax returns when he completed his SCA. During a background interview in 2017,\nhe disclosed that did not timely file his 2013 Federal income tax and had paid his 2013 tax debt in\n2017.  He did not disclose during that interview that he failed to file his Federal and state income\ntax returns for 2011.  At the hearing, he could not remember why he did not disclose during that\ninterview his 2011 tax filing deficiencies. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant admitted he failed to file his 2009, 2011, and 2014 Federal income tax returns and\nhis 2011 state income taxes as required.  He experienced conditions beyond his control and is\ncredited with resolving some of the Guideline F allegations.  However, his repeated failures to file\nsome of his tax returns in a timely manner are not mitigated.  \n1 The Judge made inconsistent findings by mistakenly stating that Applicant\u2019s 2014 Federal income tax return\nwas filed in a timely manner.    \n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omitted information from his SCA.  His explanation about forgetting\nthat he did not file timely his tax returns was not credible.  He could not remember why he did not\ndisclose to the investigator that he had not filed his Federal income tax return for 2011.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the omission of the his tax filing deficiencies on his SCA was not\ndeliberate.  He argues that he did not remember not filing his taxes for the years in question.  In this\nregard, we note that Applicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact pertaining to\nthe falsification allegation.  A falsification, even in the face of an applicant\u2019s denial of such conduct,\ncan be established through circumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0044 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 22, 2000).  Additionally, we are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01077 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 25,\n2018).  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings about the falsification allegation\nare based on substantial record evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that\ncould be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge erred in concluding that he falsified his SCA. \nIn referencing the Judge\u2019s adverse finding regarding SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant stated:\nThe statement of reason[s] said that I had failed to file, as required, my federal tax\nreturn for tax year 2014.  My federal and state tax returns were filed and completed\nbefore the hearing.  Again, I had admitted to the statement of reason[s] since the\nS.O.R. stated \u201cin a timely fashion\u201d.  But again, was removed with the S.O.R. that\nwas attached to the hearing findings.2\nAs best we can discern, Applicant is claiming the copy of the SOR attached to the Judge\u2019s decision\ndid not contain a copy of the SOR amendment.  We note the SOR amendment did not modify SOR\n\u00b6 1.d, which reflected he did not file his 2014 Federal tax return \u201cas required.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s\ncontention regarding SOR \u00b6 1.d does not demonstrate any error. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments are a disagreement with the Judges weighing of the\nevidence.  His arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in\na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at\n3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.
