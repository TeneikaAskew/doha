The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 27, 2007. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 20, 2007.  He admitted that \nthe financial accounts were his accounts but denied any security concerns for the \nfinancial considerations allegations in the SOR with explanation.  He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department counsel was prepared to proceed \non January 31, 2008.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFebruary 1, 2008, and reassigned to me on February 13, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on March 19, 2008, for a hearing on April 30, 2008.  I convened the hearing \nas scheduled.  The government offered six exhibits, marked Government exhibits (Gov. \nEx.) 1 through 6, which were received without objection.  Applicant submitted nine \ndocuments, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A-I, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf.  The record was left open for Applicant \nto submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted five document, marked App. \nEx. J-M.  The documents were admitted into the record without objection from \nDepartment Counsel.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, \n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and has worked for the past three years as a machinist \nin a Navy shipyard.  He retired from active duty in the Navy as a petty officer first class \n(E-6) after over 20 years service as a machinist in 2004.  He held a security clearance \nwhile on active duty. (Gov. Ex. 1, Security Clearance Application, dated May 23, 2005; \nApp. Ex. G, Discharge Form 214, dated June 30, 2004)  He has been married three \ntimes with a child he supports from his first marriage.  He has been married to his \npresent wife for over nine years.  (Tr. 68-69)  Applicant and his wife have a combined \nmonthly income of $6,687, with combined monthly expenses of $3,646, leaving \ncombined monthly discretionary funds of over $3,200.  (Tr. 68-72; App. Ex. H, Personal \nfinancial statement, dated April 29, 2008; App. Ex. J, pay stubs, various dates) \n \nCredit reports and the SOR have five delinquent debts: a delinquent furniture \naccount for $2,385 (SOR 1.a); a charged off account for $1,973 (SOR 1.b); an account \nplaced for collection for for $13,580 (SOR 1.c); a judgment for $1,973 (SOR 1.d); and a \ndelinquent account for $762 (SOR 1.e).  (Gov. Ex. 2, credit report, dated November 15, \n2005; Gov. Ex. 3, credit report, dated July 5, 2007; Gov. Ex. 5, credit report, dated \nJanuary 10, 2008; Gov. Ex. 6, Judgment, dated December 10, 2002) \n \nApplicant did not purchase any furniture from the creditor listed in SOR allegation \n1.a.  As soon as he learned of the delinquent debt listing on his credit report, he wrote \nthe creditor disputing the account. (Tr. 20-21, 41-44; Applicant Exhibit F Letter, undated)  \nThe account has been removed from his credit report.  (Government Exhibit 5, credit \nreport, dated January 10, 2008; Applicant Exhibit A, dated March 6, 2008) \n \nThe debts listed in SOR allegations 1.b and 1.d are the same debt.  SOR \nallegation 1.b is the debt to the original creditor, and SOR allegation 1.d is the account \nas a judgment.  The account was his third wife\u2019s account which she incurred before she \nmarried Applicant.  When they married, the creditor listed Applicant as an authorized \nuser and also responsible for the card payments.  When Applicant leaned of the \ndelinquent account, he paid the judgment in full in July 2004, thus settling the account.  \n(Tr. 24-28, 44-45; App. Ex. C, paid in full letter, dated December 19, 2007) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant purchased a used car in 1996, financed by the creditor listed in SOR \nallegation 1.c.  At the time, Applicant was on active duty in the Navy stationed on a ship \nbased in California.  He listed as his home address his mother\u2019s house in California.  \nAfter returning from a deployment, Applicant moved the car to Virginia where it was \nregistered with the required and accepted insurance coverage.  Applicant paid the loan \nby allotment for at least two years.  When he returned from a deployment, he learned \nthe car had been repossessed.  He was informed by the creditor that sometime during \nthe loan time, they did not accept his car insurance as sufficient and used some of his \ncar payment to purchase insurance, thus putting his loan in default.  He never received \nany correspondence from the creditor that his payments were being diverted to pay for \ninsurance.  His mother never informed him if any correspondence was received at her \nhouse.  Applicant believed he had almost paid the car loan.  Since he learned the car \nhad been repossessed, he told the creditor to advise him what was remaining on the \nloan after the car was sold.  Applicant was advised at the time, he still owed over \n$10,000.  The car was originally purchased for $7,000.  Applicant made over two years \nof car payments at $325 monthly so that only about $3,000 should have remained on \nthe loan.  Applicant was recently advised that he owes over $21,000.  The debt in the \nSOR allegation and the credit report is listed for $13,580.  (Tr. 22-23, 47-67)  The credit \nreport listing was supposed to be removed from his credit report in August 2007. (App. \nEx. E, credit report information, dated August 29, 2006)  Applicant has disputed this \naccount with the creditor and sought his Navy active duty finance records to show the \npayroll allotment for the debt.  The records have not been received. (App. Exs. J-M, \nLetters and postal receipts, dated May 20, 2008)   \n \nThe bank credit card debt listed in SOR allegation 1.e also belonged to his third \nwife before they married.  The latest credit reports show the account is current and \nbeing paid as agreed.  (Tr. 29-29, 45-47; Gov. Ex. 5, credit report, date January 10. \n2008; App. Ex. A, credit report, dated March 6, 2008) \n \nApplicant\u2019s latest credit report shows his debts are mostly current or paid in full. \n(Tr. 30-31)  The car loan debt in SOR allegation 1.c is still listed.  There is a collection \naccount listed for a cell phone.  However, Applicant presented documentation that that \naccount was paid in full.  (App. Ex. D, Letter, dated April 19, 2008)  There is a collection \naccount listed for $53.  However, Applicant presented documentation that the account \nwas paid in full. (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated March 28, 2008) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \n\n \n5 \n \n \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts listed in credit reports are a security concern \nraising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations),  Since two of the debts are the same, the SOR allegations are for four \ndelinquent debts. \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.  The debts happened years ago when \napplicant was on active duty or were his wife\u2019s before they married.  He has either paid \nthe debts or disputed them.  Since the debts have either been paid or disputed, they do \nnot cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) has some application to Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues.  Two of the debts were the same debt.  This debt and another debt \nwere incurred by his wife before they married.  When he learned of the debts, he paid \nthem.  The other two delinquent debts have been disputed by Applicant.  The debts \neither arose by the actions of his wife or are in dispute so they were largely beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control.  The remaining debt was caused by the creditor\u2019s questionable \naction that was unknown to Applicant.  Since he paid two debts and disputed two \nothers, he acted reasonably under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good effort to pay them.  Applicant paid two of the debts in full and \ndisputed the other two.  His present credit report and other documents show his \naccounts are paid in full, except for the car loan he disputes.  Applicant acted \nresponsibly towards his debts and they are under control.  Applicant established his \ngood-faith efforts to resolve his debts, and mitigated security concerns for his financial \nsituation \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve he \nissues) applies.  Applicant disputed two of the debts.  He did not have any knowledge of \n\n \n6 \n \n \none debt and has a legitimate dispute on another debt.  For the furniture debt that he \nhas no knowledge of, Applicant wrote the creditor and the debt was removed from his \ncredit report.  On the car loan, Applicant had legitimate concerns about the debt \nbecause the creditor did not credit his full payments to his account.  He provided \nsufficient information of his action with the creditor to resolve the issue.  Applicant has \npresented \nsufficient \ninformation \nto \nmitigate \nsecurity \nconcerns \nfor \nfinancial \nconsiderations. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant\u2019s over \n20 years honorable active duty in the Navy during which he successfully held a security \nclearance.  I considered that he took responsibility for the debts and paid two of the four \nof concern and disputed the other two.  I considered that Applicant\u2019s other financial \nobligations are paid as agreed.  He manages his finances in a manner that does not \ncreate a security concern.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

I did not \ntake administrative notice of the source documents HE VI and VII. In accordance with \nISCR Case No. 03-21434 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007), those documents were remarked \nas GE 4 and 5, and admitted without objection as government exhibits.  \n \n\n3 \n \nThe request for administrative notice of certain facts relating to Hong Kong (HE \nXIV) includes the facts, \u201c[u]nder Chinese nationality law, persons who are of Chinese \ndescent and who were born in the mainland of China or Hong Kong are citizens of \nChina.\u201d The request references the Consular Information Sheet on Hong Kong (HE \nXVII). The request references an earlier version of the Consular Information Sheet on \nHong Kong than was submitted as a source document. The revised Consular \nInformation Sheet submitted as HE XVII does not contain the requested information. \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is alleged in the SOR. Since the crux of the issue is whether \nApplicant is a Hong Kong citizen, I am taking administrative notice of the immigration \nlaws of Hong Kong and the PRC. Information was obtained through the Government of \nHong Kong Special Administrative Region Immigration Department web site at \nwww.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/topical-3.htm.  A copy is included as HE XVIII. The requests \nfor administrative notice and the attached source documents, with the exception of the \ntwo documents remarked GE 4 and 5, were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits. The facts administratively noticed are set out \nin the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nApplicant testified on her own behalf and submitted exhibits (AE) A through E, \nwhich were admitted without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old Registered Nurse. She was born in Hong Kong and \nattended nursing school there. She came to the United States in the late 1980s and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1995. She is married with two children, eleven and nine years \nold. Both her children were born in the U.S.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father fled from China to Hong Kong before the Communist \nrevolution. He passed away when Applicant was a young child. Her mother is in her late \n60s. She was born in Hong Kong and still resides there. She was a midwife but retired \nabout ten years ago. Applicant\u2019s brother lives in a country in the British Commonwealth. \nHer sister is a resident of Hong Kong and works in the health care industry. Applicant\u2019s \nmother remarried after the death of her husband. She had two more children with her \nnew husband.  Applicant\u2019s half brothers are residents of Hong Kong. She is estranged \nfrom her youngest half brother and does not know how he is employed. She is unsure of \nwhat her other half brother does for a living as he has changed jobs on a few occasions. \nThe last job she knew about he was working in the private sector. Applicant speaks with \nher mother about every two weeks and her sister about every three months.2   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was born in Taiwan. He came to the U.S. in the early 1990s. \nHe became a U.S. citizen about four or five years ago. His father is deceased. His \nmother is a citizen and resident of the Republic of China (Taiwan). She worked in the \nmedical industry but retired a few years ago. His brother is a citizen and resident of \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 37, 59; GE 1-3. \n \n2 Tr. at 35-36, 40-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n\n4 \n \nTaiwan. He works in law enforcement. Applicant is not close to her in-laws. Her \nhusband only talked to his brother on the telephone a few times in the ten plus years he \nhas been married. Her mother-in-law has visited them in the U.S. on about three \noccasions. Applicant has no assets in Hong Kong. Her mother-in-law\u2019s home in Taiwan \nis in Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s name.3 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the PRC in 2002; Hong Kong and \nTaiwan in 2005; and last year she traveled to Hong Kong. She has possessed a Hong \nKong permanent identity card since she was about 12 years old. The only passport \nApplicant possesses is her U.S. passport. The identification card provides her with the \nright of abode (ROA) in Hong Kong. She has used the identification card to enter Hong \nKong. She was able to use it in conjunction with her U.S. passport, or on its own when \nshe entered Hong Kong. There is no Hong Kong immigration stamp on her U.S. \npassport from when she traveled to Hong Kong in 2005. The identification card cannot \nbe used to enter the PRC or any other country. She used her U.S. passport for all her \nother international travel.4 \n \nApplicant has stated in the past that she was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Hong \nKong. She also stated that her family members were citizens of Hong Kong. At the \nhearing she admitted she was ignorant of the law in this regard.5 Applicant and her \nfamily were citizens of the British colony, Hong Kong, before it reverted to the PRC in \n1997. Applicant became a U.S. citizen before the reversion. Under Chinese nationality \nlaw, persons of Chinese descent who were born on the Chinese mainland or Hong \nKong are considered citizens of the PRC. It appears her family members are technically \ncitizens of the PRC, but residents of Hong Kong. It is unclear whether they remain \nBritish citizens or have any other citizenship. Under the above Chinese nationality law, \nApplicant would be considered a Chinese citizen by the PRC, except for a different \nprovision of the Chinese nationality law. The PRC does not recognize dual nationality.6 \nUnder the Chinese nationality law: \n \nAny Chinese national who has settled abroad and who has been \nnaturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his \nown free will shall automatically lose Chinese nationality.7 \n \n \nApplicant has the right of abode in Hong Kong, but she lost any claim to Chinese \ncitizenship when she became a U.S. citizen. Applicant testified she now thinks of herself \nas only a U.S. citizen. She left Hong Kong 19 years ago when it was a British colony. \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 37, 48-52, 89-90; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n4 Tr. at 41-43, 50-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; HE XIV, XVIII. \n \n5 Tr. at 46, 55-56, 60-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n6 HE XVIII. \n \n7 Id. \n \n\n5 \n \nShe does not feel a current connection to Hong Kong. She stated that if Hong Kong \nconsidered her a citizen, that she would be willing to renounce that citizenship.8  \n \n \nApplicant is very highly regarded by her employer and in her community. \nCharacter letters describe her as a woman of integrity, honest, trustworthy, efficient, an \noutstanding citizen who values our nation\u2019s principles, and someone who cares deeply \nabout her nation and her role serving the military customer. Her supervisor wrote that \nshe is extremely dedicated, loyal, and customer focused and truly cares about the \ntreatment of their military customers. Her work ethic, adherence to policy mandates, \ncaution concerning the privacy and confidentiality of her patients, and general \nperformance of her duties are above reproach. Thirty-four co-workers signed a joint \nletter stating they believe Applicant is a trustworthy person and they hope that she will \nbe granted eligibility for a Public Trust Position.9 \n \nTaiwan and PRC \n \n \nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That \nsame year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC \ndoes not recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-part democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work and \nsound economic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an underdeveloped, \nagricultural island to an economic power that is a leading producer of high-technology \ngoods. On January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the PRC as the sole \nlegal government of China. The U.S. also announced that it would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people on Taiwan. The Taiwan \nRelations Act (TRA) signed into law on April 10, 1979, created the legal authority for the \nconduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan, a private \nnonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is authorized to issue visas, accept \npassport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A counterpart \norganization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S. \n \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. \ndoes not support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in \nappropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nwhich it joined in 2002, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the \nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for \nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to \nTaiwan, in accordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 64-65. \n \n9 AE A-E. \n \n\n6 \n \nUnited States would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a \nsubstantial sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine \naircraft, and diesel submarines. The White House also was more accommodating to \nvisits from Taiwan\u2019s officials than previous U.S. Administrations, and permitted visits \nfrom Taiwan\u2019s president in 2001 and 2003, and Taiwan\u2019s vice president and defense \nminister in 2002. \n \n \nSince then, there have been changes in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan\u2019s new \npresident disavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus \nquo\u201d that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the \nmore provocative position that Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \n\u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain. There was also a series of recent corruption \nscandals. \n \n \nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the Administration appears to \nhave dialed back its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still \npursuing a close relationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing \ncriticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and \nwarnings to the effect that U.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  \n \n \nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over \na billion people and an economy growing at about 10% per year. The PRC has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The PRC has a \npoor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices \ninclude arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners. \n \n \nBoth the PRC and Taiwan are known to be active collectors of U.S. economic \nintelligence. The PRC also maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong. \n \nHong Kong \n \nHong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region of the PRC since July 1, \n1997, ending more than 150 years of British colonial rule. Hong Kong has a high degree \nof autonomy, except in the areas of defense and foreign policy, which are the \nresponsibility of the PRC. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is headed by a \nChief Executive voted on by an Election Committee made up of approximately 800 \nHong Kong residents from four constituency groups, including the PRC\u2019s National \nPeople\u2019s Congress. Under Chinese nationality law, persons of Chinese descent who \nwere born on the Chinese mainland or Hong Kong are considered citizens of the PRC. \n \n \nWhile Hong Kong remains a free and open society where human rights are \nrespected, courts are independent, and there is a well-established respect for the rule of \nlaw, concerns include limitations on residents\u2019 ability to change their government, the \nlegislature\u2019s limited power to affect government policies, self-censorship, violence and \ndiscrimination against women, and restrictions on worker\u2019s rights to organize and \nbargain collectively. \n\n7 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n8 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \n \nApplicant possesses a Hong Kong permanent identity card. This is not an \nexercise of foreign citizenship as Applicant forfeited any right to Chinese, and by \nextension Hong Kong, citizenship when she became a U.S. citizen. Hong Kong is a very \nunique place since the reversion. It is no longer a British colony, but it is also not totally \nthe PRC. There are special rules in place to address all the former British citizens. The \nHong Kong permanent identity card grants Applicant the right of abode in Hong Kong, \nmuch in the same way that a U.S. \u201cgreen card\u201d reflects permanent residence status in \nthe U.S. for foreign nationals. In this case, possession and use of the Hong Kong \npermanent identity card is no more an exercise of Hong Kong citizenship than \npossession of a U.S. green card is an exercise of U.S. citizenship. No Foreign \nPreference disqualifying condition has been established.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11, including: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n\n9 \n \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship. \n \nApplicant was born in Hong Kong. If she was considered a dual citizen, it would \nbe because of her birth in Hong Kong. She has expressed a willingness to renounce \nany dual citizenship. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a) and (b) are applicable to any remaining Foreign \nPreference concerns. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and half brothers are residents of Hong Kong. They \nare also considered to be Chinese citizens. The PRC has an authoritarian government, \ndominated by the Communist Party, with a poor human rights record, and targets the \nU.S. for espionage. Her husband\u2019s mother and brother are citizens and residents of \nTaiwan, a country known to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence. This \n\n10 \n \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b) and (d) have \nbeen raised by the evidence. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant was born in Hong Kong while it was still a British colony. She came to \nthe U.S. and became a citizen before it reverted to the PRC in 1997. British culture and \ncapitalism influenced her as a youth, not the Chinese mainland dominated by the \nCommunist Party. She has family in Hong Kong and her husband has family in Taiwan. \nThe PRC and Taiwan both collect U.S. intelligence. She has lived in the U.S. for many \nyears and has been a citizen for more than 12 years. Her husband is a U.S. citizen and \nher children were born in the U.S. Applicant is a respected, highly regarded Registered \nNurse. She was lauded for maintaining patient privacy and confidentiality. I find there is \nno conflict of interest, because Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in America that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. No other mitigating condition is fully \napplicable. \n\n11 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Hong Kong \nwhen it was a British colony. She came to the U.S. as a young woman about 19 years \nago. She became a U.S. citizen in 1995. She has never lived in Hong Kong after it \nreverted in 1997. Her husband is from Taiwan, but he is also a U.S. citizen. They have \ntwo children born in the U.S. She is now a fully assimilated American, and a highly \nregarded Registered Nurse with a proven record of maintaining patient privacy and \nconfidentiality. She does not consider herself a Hong Kong or Chinese citizen. If Hong \nKong did consider her one of its citizens, she would be willing to renounce that \ncitizenship.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Hong Kong and Taiwan. \nHong Kong is no longer a British colony. Hong Kong remains a free and open society \nwhere human rights are generally respected. It has some autonomy but is closely \nconnected to the PRC. The PRC has an authoritarian government, a bad human rights \nrecord, and has a very aggressive espionage program. The PRC conducts intelligence \noperations in Hong Kong and Taiwan. \n \nTaiwan is an ally of the United States. However, Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified [or sensitive] information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of \nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.\u201d10 The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be \nmade with caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly.  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \n                                                          \n10 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n12 \n \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \n \n \nThe U.S. officially supports the \u201cone China\u201d policy. However, to treat the PRC \nand Taiwan the same is to ignore reality. They currently function as separate entities. \nTaiwan is a democracy, does not have a poor human rights record, and is dependent \nupon the United States for arms, as well as its defense against the PRC. Taiwan is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, but there is no \nindication that Taiwan utilizes coercion against its citizens for espionage purposes.  \n \nIn the unlikely event that Applicant\u2019s family in Hong Kong, or her husband\u2019s \nfamily in Taiwan, were subjected to coercion or duress from either government in an \nattempt to obtain sensitive information, I find that because of her deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her Foreign \nPreference and Foreign Influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n13 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Wheat, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to show sufficient financial responsibility to mitigate security \nconcerns regarding Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 13, 2005, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On November 5, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).2 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Applicant responded to the SOR on \nDecember 26, 2007 and requested a hearing before and Administrative Judge. \n \n \nDOHA received the case on February 14, 2008, and assigned it to me that same \nday. Applicant requested a delay in the hearing from March 10 to March 18, 2008 (Tr. \n9). The hearing was conducted as rescheduled on March 28, 2008. I admitted five \ngovernment exhibits (GE 1-5; Tr. 17-21), and three Applicant Exhibits (AE 1-3). \nApplicant made an oral statement during her hearing and called two witnesses. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 9, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and provided releases of the \nfederal tax liens pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b (Tr. 10-11). Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old (Tr. 126).3 She has never been married (Tr. 126). Her \nchildren are ages 11 and 20 years old (Tr. 126). She completed three years of college \n(Tr. 127).  \n \n \nApplicant currently works for a contractor providing services to a federal agency, \n(ensuring compliance with statutes) and attending some interagency meetings (Tr. 45). \nShe has worked for this agency since 2000, but for the first few years she worked in the \ntravel section monitoring credit cards and account information (Tr. 47-48). She currently \nprocesses federal register notifications and charter renewals (Tr. 45). She never has \nhad access to classified information in the past and does not require access to \nclassified information now (Tr. 45). She currently has an ADP-type public trust position \n(Tr. 46). She submitted her security clearance application in January 2005 because her \nproject manager told her to do so (Tr. 47). Her employment was contingent on \ncontinued approval of her ADP clearance for her public trust position (Tr. 47). When she \n \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n2  When she completed her SF 86, Applicant denied that in the last seven years she had filed for \nbankruptcy, had any property repossessed, had any wages garnished, and had any unpaid judgments. \nSee GE 1, Questions 33, 34, 35 and 37. She listed the two large federal tax liens and two debts that were \nover 180 days delinquent. See GE 1, Questions 36 and 38.    \n \n3  Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nreceived the SOR, she was advised that revocation of her public trust clearance was a \npossibility (Tr. 47).     \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR listed five debts totaling $50,673. She settled and paid SOR debt 1.d in \nthe amount of $535 (AE 1). The other four debts were not paid; however, the two largest \ndebts became unenforceable because of the passage of time (AE 2). She promised to \ntry to resolve the remaining two enforceable debts. Those five debts will be addressed \nin the order they appear in the SOR. \n \nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a lien against Applicant in the amount of \n$41,493 in March 2003 in connection with tax years 1993 and 1994 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and in \nthe amount of $6,013 on March 20, 1996 in connection with tax years 1989-1991 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b).  Applicant provided releases for the taxes owed, dated December 17, 2007 (AE \n2). The releases indicated the following amounts were owed as of the IRS assessment \ndates: \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTax Year \nDate of Assessment\nUnpaid Balance of \nAssessment \n1.b \n1989 \nJuly 18, 1994 \n$3,286.56 \n1.b \n1990 \nOctober 18, 1994 \n$2,396.20 \n1.b \n1991 \nApril 4, 1994 \n$331.09 \n1.a \n1993 \nAugust 25, 1997 \n$21,029.09 \n1.a \n1994 \nAugust 25, 1997 \n$20,464.35 \n \n \nTotal: \n$47,507.29 \n \nApplicant did not file her 1993 and 1994 taxes when she was required to do so \n(Tr. 134-135). Later, Applicant\u2019s sister recommended that Ms. E assist with filing \nApplicant\u2019s tax returns for 1993 and 1994 (Tr. 50, 74). Applicant was unsure when her \n1993 and 1994 tax returns were actually filed (Tr. 135-136). She was also unsure about \nwhether her tax returns for 1989, 1990, and 1991 were filed on time or not (Tr. 136). \nThese returns contained false information, which was discovered in an IRS audit (Tr. \n50). Everyone who had taxes filed by Ms. E had their returns audited (Tr. 75). Ms. E \nwould just make \u201cup stuff\u201d for tax returns (Tr. 76). Applicant was not sure whether she \npaid any taxes in 1993 and 1994 (Tr. 76). She did not closely review the tax returns Ms. \nE prepared for her (Tr. 79). She thought Ms. E signed some tax returns for her (Tr. \n137).4  \nIn 1994, Applicant\u2019s gross income was about $58,303 and her taxable income \nwas $5,170 (Tr. 87-89). Her 1994 tax return showed a refund of $499 (Tr. 89). It was \nsigned on November 15, 1995 (Tr. 152). Eventually the IRS filed a lien for 1994 in the \n                                            \n4  Applicant\u2019s 1994 tax return has Applicant\u2019s signature on it; however, it may not have been \nsigned by Ms. E (Tr. 139). It did not have Ms. E\u2019s address in the address of preparer section (Tr. 139). \nShe insisted Ms. E prepared some of her tax returns; however, she was unsure about which tax returns \nMs. E prepared for her (Tr. 140, 153). \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                           \namount of $20,464 (which included interest and penalties) (Tr. 90, 123; AE 2). At the \ntime the IRS filed the tax lien Applicant was unemployed, and had a new baby (Tr. 92).5  \n \nIn 2001, Applicant hired a company that helped with tax issues, paying them \n$400 monthly; however, they did not help with her tax problems (Tr. 51, 56, 141). She \npaid the company a total of about $2,500 (Tr. 142).6 The company did not refund any of \nher payments (Tr. 57). She did not file a complaint against the company (Tr. 142).  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant sought assistance from Ms. A (Tr. 140) and refilled her taxes \nwith the assistance of Ms. A (Tr. 78-79). She said Ms. A helped with taxes for tax years \n1996 to 2004 (Tr. 142-143). Applicant indicated at one point she was unsure about \nwhether Ms. A had refilled her tax returns (Tr. 93), and about which tax returns Ms. A \nrefilled for her (Tr. 154). She said she did not understand taxes (Tr. 75). She claimed \nshe contacted the IRS several times over the years about her taxes (Tr. 94-95). When \nshe had her interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management, \nshe promised to contact the IRS about her taxes and make arrangements to resolve her \ndebts (Tr. 95-96). She did not contact the IRS after 2002 because Ms. A told her not to \ndo so (Tr. 144). When she completed her SF 86 on January 13, 2005, she said she \nplanned to resolve her tax problems in 2005 (GE 1 at Question 43). On August 2, 2007, \nshe promised to pay her tax debts using funds from refinancing her rental property (GE \n3). Between 2001 and April 2008, she did not contact the IRS until 2007 (Tr. 144). \nWhen she contacted the IRS in 2007, the IRS informed her that the two tax liens had \nbeen released because 10 years elapsed without the taxes being paid (Tr. 58-61, 124, \n143; AE 2). 7   \n \nApplicant owed $6,013 for an IRS lien filed on March 20, 1996 in connection with \ntax years 1989 to 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant said the IRS garnished one of her \nchecks (Tr. 76). She also said she paid the IRS $6,000 before she lost her job; \nhowever, she claimed the IRS refused to give her documentation to show the payment \n \n5  Later she clarified that she was under employed in 1996. The amount of work she received \nfrom her employer was significantly reduced, and there was a corresponding reduction in her income (Tr. \n98-99). She was unemployed for about two months around May 2002 (Tr. 133). \n \n6  Page 2 of a company statement, dated November 12, 2002, lists payments from four checks \ntotaling $1,700 (AE 3). However, the same statement also indicates from April 17, 2001, to March 20, \n2002, Applicant paid $3,100 into the company account for resolving her delinquent taxes (AE 3).  \nApplicant did not provide page 1 of the company statement. \n \n7  A levy must be made or proceeding in court begun to collect a federal tax lien within 10 years \nafter a tax assessment is made. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502; United States v. Galletti, 541 U.S. 114, 119 \n(2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during a bankruptcy proceeding, see United \nStates v. Doe, 438 F.Supp.2d 796 (S.D. Ohio 2006), by agreements (made before Dec. 20, 2000), see \nUnited States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101, 1106 (11th Cir. 2007), or while an offer in compromise (made on or \nafter Dec. 31, 1999) is pending. Id. There was no evidence of record about levies, judicial collection \nactions, agreements, offers in compromise, or bankruptcy. As indicated in the IRS releases, the collection \nof the 1994 and 1997 federal tax liens were barred by the 10-year statute of limitations in 2004 and 2007, \nrespectively.    \n    \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                           \n(Tr. 77). She also said the IRS did not have documentation showing the $6,000 \npayment (Tr. 97). She said she could not find her documentation on the payment (Tr. \n97). As indicated previously, the IRS lien was released in 2007 (GE 2). \n \nApplicant owed the IRS $1,000 for her 2004 taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 102-104). The \n$1,000 debt pertained to her failure to provide proper documentation to support her \nchild care credit or deduction (Tr. 145). She had another tax debt from 2005 in the \namount of $558 (Tr. 104, 148). She had a problem with her income tax for 2004 that \nwas unresolved concerning documentation from one of the companies where she \nworked (Tr. 122). She is working with the IRS to straighten out the documentation (Tr. \n123). The IRS will not start a payment plan until Applicant provides complete \ndocumentation to show how much she owes (Tr. 146). After her car is paid off in May \n2008, she plans to start paying the IRS $500 a month (Tr. 101). She was unsure about \nwhen she first learned about her problem with her 2004 taxes (Tr. 145). Her most recent \ncontact with the IRS was on March 21, 2008 (Tr. 147). At the time of her hearing, she \nwas working with the IRS towards resolution of this debt (Tr. 62, 100). \n \nApplicant owed a collection agency $535 for a telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nAbout four years ago, Applicant signed a contract for a cell phone account on behalf of \nher son, who was 16 (Tr. 62, 108, 148).8 Shortly after receiving the phone, her \nresidence was burglarized and the phone was stolen (Tr. 62). Applicant had a \nsettlement offer, dated February 8, 2008, for $267.51 for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d (AE 1, 2; \nTr. 54).  She paid this debt (Tr. 64). \n \nIn regard to the judgment for $1,632 in SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant explained she had \nlost her job, and had just had a baby (Tr. 65). She was unable to pay her rent and \nmoved out of her apartment (Tr. 65). She informed the landlord about her inability to pay \nthe rent (Tr. 65). Applicant went to court in 1997 and contested the debt (Tr. 105). In \n1997, the landlord obtained a judgment for $1,632 (Tr. 104). She has been aware of this \njudgment for 11 years (Tr. 105). She paid $100 to her former landlord (Tr. 150-151). \nThe landlord now wants $3,000 to resolve this debt (Tr. 66). She called the creditor in \nAugust 2007, and the week before her hearing about compromising the debt (Tr. 67). \nShe was willing to pay this debt (Tr. 66).   \n \nFrom 1995 to 2004, Applicant\u2019s annual income has been in the $50,000 to \n$60,000 range (Tr. 123). Applicant\u2019s current annual salary is $69,000 (Tr. 67). After \nmaking debt and expense payments, she has about $300 a month remaining (Tr. 117). \nShe financially supports her 11-year-old daughter and 20-year old son, who is in school \n(Tr. 67). Her daughter attends a private school, and Applicant borrowed $1,300 for \ntuition from her IRA and $1,200 from a credit union (Tr. 68-69). She had difficulty \nborrowing money earlier (Tr. 111). She bought a 2001 Volvo in 2002 for $25,000 (Tr. \n \n8  When discussing her son and his cell phone, she said, \u201cWell I was going to say the cell phone \nbecause my son had been robbed going to school. So, a man robbed him of his bicycle.\u201d (Tr. 149). She \nwanted her son to pay for the cell phone account because that would teach him about being financially \nresponsible (Tr. 149). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n113). Her remaining car loan debt of $829 will be paid off in May 2008 (Tr. 68, 113).  \nShe and her mother purchased a rental property in 1979, and paid it off in December \n2004 (Tr. 115-116). The tenants damaged her rental property (Tr. 116-117). Over the \nlast several years, her strategy for paying her tax debts centered on using rent from her \nrental property; however she had problems obtaining the rent (Tr. 118). Otherwise she \nis debt free (Tr. 69). \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2007 credit report shows some debts for credit cards taken out \nwithout her permission (Tr. 69-70). She has contacted the credit reporting company to \nhave her credit report corrected (Tr. 70). She paid the other debts indicated on the 2007 \ncredit report (Tr. 70-72). She paid a large medical debt resulting from treatments around \nher baby\u2019s birth in 1997 (there was a judgment for $12,187) (Tr. 106-107). She thought \nthe amount of the judgment was a mistake (Tr. 107). She provided a letter dated \nNovember 1, 2002, indicating this medical debt was paid (SOR response). She received \nabout six weeks of credit counseling in late 2007 (Tr. 72-73, 114-115).     \n \nCharacter Witnesses \n \nMs. S has worked for a federal agency for 19 years (Tr. 33). Ms. S worked \nclosely with Applicant for four years (Tr. 25). She has daily contact with Applicant and \ntheir offices adjoin each other (Tr. 26). They occasionally go to lunch together, but \notherwise do not socialize away from the office (Tr. 31). Applicant does not currently \nrequire a Secret clearance, but still requires her public trust clearance (Tr. 28). Applicant \nensures agency compliance with federal laws (Tr. 25). Although Ms. S was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, she considers Applicant to be highly reliable and \ncompletely trustworthy (Tr. 28-29).  \n \nMs. T has worked for a federal agency for six years involving billing and \nexpenses on agency-related credit cards (Tr. 36-37). Beginning in 2002, she worked in \nthe same office with Applicant (Tr. 37). Ms. T has daily interaction with Applicant (Tr. \n38). Applicant was involved in the processing of travel bills (Tr. 37). Applicant had \naccess to sensitive, personal financial information (Tr. 38). If Applicant had abused the \ninformation provided, that abuse would have surfaced, and no such abuse was \ndisclosed or discovered (Tr. 38). Ms. T did not believe Applicant was living beyond her \nmeans (Tr. 39). Applicant has solid integrity and is a trustworthy person (Tr. 39). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d9 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n \n9  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n10  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n8 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides four Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts, . . . (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, . . . \n[and] (g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or \nthe fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, her \nSOR response, her response to interrogatories, and her statement at her hearing. In \n1994, the IRS determined she owed about $6,000 for her federal taxes. These taxes \nwere never paid and they became legally uncollectible in 2004. In 1997, the IRS \nassessed her tax debt for 1993 and 1994 at over $40,000. These taxes were never paid \nand they became legally uncollectible in 2007. She did not file her taxes on time, and \nconceded her tax return in 1994 contained \u201cmade-up\u201d information. She has a judgment \nthat has been unresolved since 1997. She has federal income taxes that are unresolved \nfrom 2004 and 2005. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c) and 19(g).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n \n9 \n \n                                           \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent \ndebts between 2002 and 2007. She was unemployed in 1997, and was underemployed \nbefore receiving employment in 2002 with a federal contractor. From 1994 to 2007, she \nhad a substantial amount of delinquent federal income taxes. From 2002 to 2007, she \nfollowed Ms. A\u2019s advice and employed a deliberate strategy not to contact the IRS \nbecause negotiations with the IRS might extend her tax liability. See n. 9, supra.  She \ncurrently has unresolved debt with the IRS. Moreover, she did not make sufficient \nprogress on resolution of her 1997 judgment. These factors cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Additionally, she did not describe \nany conditions, such as divorce, unemployment or medical treatment, which occurred \nbetween 2002 and her hearing, which caused her to be unable to make greater \nprogress resolving her financial problems.11  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant received financial counseling. \nHowever, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol.\u201d There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant applied the \nknowledge obtained from financial counseling or that she showed good faith12 in the \nresolution of her debts. \n \n11  \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n12  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \n\n \n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nThe SOR listed five debts totaling $50,673. Applicant settled and paid SOR debt \n1.d in the amount of $535 (AE 1). The other four debts were not paid; however, the two \nlargest debts became unenforceable because of the passage of time (AE 2). In her \n2005 SF 86, she indicated she planned to resolve her delinquent debts. When she \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories on August 2, 2007, she promised to try to resolve \nthe remaining two enforceable debts; however, she did not establish payment plans for \nher remaining IRS debts or on her 1997 judgment. Her efforts are insufficient to mitigate \nfinancial concerns pertaining to these two debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to mitigate \nthe SOR debts because these two unpaid and unresolved debts are not disputed. She \ndid not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d with respect to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.e.   \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient correspondence with her creditors for SOR \ndebts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.e to establish she acted responsibly and in good faith. She \nfailed to provide proof of payment plans. Her overall conduct with her creditors casts \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her financial \nproblems are continuing and likely to recur. She should have been more diligent and \nmade greater efforts to resolve her delinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR. \nShe has not carried her burden of proving her financial responsibility. Based on my \nevaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully \napply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in her favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal \nissue), she is a law-abiding citizen. She does not abuse drugs, and has no criminal \nrecord. The overall amount of her delinquent, enforceable debt at about $3,000 is \nrelatively low. She paid one SOR debt. She filed all tax returns from 1995 to present. \nSome of her financial problems were caused by unemployment and underemployment. \nShe paid a cell phone-related delinquent debt in March 2008, and a large medical debt \nin 2002. She completed financial counseling. These factors show significant \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct for security clearance \npurposes is more substantial. She has three years of college, and has worked \nmonitoring travel accounts and credit cards. She is 52 years old with a wealth of job-\nrelated experiences. She received financial counselling, and has sufficient knowledge to \nbudget, and file accurate and complete tax returns. From 1994 to 2007, she owed more \nthan $40,000 to the IRS, and she admits she did not pay the IRS anything to resolve \nthese delinquent taxes. Nor did her evidence establish any efforts to settle or negotiate \na payment plan. For the last five years, she has been paid by a federal contractor. Her \nsalary was funded by other taxpayers, who dutifully paid their taxes. She is well aware \nof her tax-paying responsibilities, yet she did little to act responsibly as a taxpayer. She \nlearned of the security significance of her delinquent debts when she had her OPM \ninterview. This security concern was reinforced when she responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories, and again when she received the SOR. Her efforts to resolve her \ndelinquent debts, especially her IRS debts, were insufficient to fully resolve security \nconcerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts \nand circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n \n12 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 11, 2007, detailing the basis\nfor its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).  The President\nissued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them\non September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines\nare to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised\nguidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 10, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on October 2, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on October 9, 2007.  I convened a hearing on October 16, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  Applicant agreed to waive the rule requiring15-days written notice of the hearing.   The\n2\ngovernment offered seven exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-7.  Applicant offered five exhibits, marked\nas Exhibits A-E.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  I kept the record open until October\n23, 2007, to give Applicant the time to file additional documents.  He filed one exhibit consisting\nof three pages that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.  The government had no objection and the\nexhibit was admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 40-year-old administrative assistant and finance manager employed by a\nfederal contractor.   He is single.  He is a high school graduate and has completed 71 hours for a\n3\ndegree majoring in information systems with a minor in accounting.   He served in the United States\n4\n\nId. at 18.\n5\nId. at 20.\n6\nId. at 29.\n7\nId. at 35.\n8\nId. at 51.\n9\nId. at 57-60.\n10\nId. at 60-65.\n11\nId. at 88.\n12\nId. at 24.\n13\n3\nNavy from 1986 to October 2006.  He retired as a petty officer first class (E-6), and his service is\ncharacterized as honorable.   He has held a security clearance continuously since 1986.\n5\n6\nApplicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1986 to at least May 2006.\nIn December 1987, Applicant drove into a telephone poll and was charged with driving under\nthe influence and paid a fine.   He refused a Breathalyzer test.\n7\n8\nAnd July 1992, Applicant ran a stop sign and kept going.   He was arrested and charged with\n9\n(1) fleeing from police, (2) reckless driving, and (3) driving under the influence.  He was fined and\nordered to complete community service and a Level II Alcohol Program for counts (2) and (3).\nApplicant purchased a new car in June 1998, and decided to take it out for a test drive.  He\ndrove 120 miles per hour, was arrested, and charged with driving under the influence.  He received\na fine, and the military suspended his driving privileges for six months.  He also lost base privileges\nfor a period of time.10\nApplicant was arrested in June 2001, and charged with driving under the influence.  He was\nfined and ordered to attend an alcohol program.  He received alcohol-related treatment from July\n2001 to August 2001, at an alcohol rehabilitation center operated by the Navy.   This incident cost\n11\nhim a promotion.12\nIn February 2005, Applicant was found asleep in his car with the motor running and the lights\non.  He was arrested and charged with (1) driving while intoxicated and (2) operating a vehicle while\nintoxicated.  He was fined and ordered to attend an alcohol prevention class.13\n\nId. at 22.\n14\n Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F (Alcohol Program Completion Letter, dated October 12, 2007) at 1-3.\n15\nId. at 3.\n16\nTr. at 78, 88.\n17\nId. at 92-101.\n18\nGuideline \u00b6 2. \n19\nGuideline \u00b6 2(c).\n20\n4\nApplicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) from August 2001 to November 2001.  He\nhas not attended any AA meetings since November 2001.   He underwent a 26-hour alcohol\n14\nevaluation program a week before the hearing.  The program director indicated that Applicant\nattended all sessions with a cooperative and positive attitude.  He believed that Applicant had\nbenefitted from the program and organized an increased his understanding of the need to avoid\nalcohol and other drugs.  He also studied the negative effects on driving, and on one\u2019s self, family,\nand society.   However the curriculum vitae of the director indicates he was not a duly qualified\n15\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker.16\nHe abstained from drinking alcohol for two weeks prior to the hearing, primarily because of\nthe security clearance process.   Three character witnesses testified that they had never seen\n17\nApplicant intoxicated or with the smell of alcohol on his breath.  They also were unaware of the\nextent of Applicant\u2019s alcohol arrests.18\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process.   An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\n19\nimpartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.20\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\n\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).\n21\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n22\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n23\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence\n24\n.  \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\n5\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n21\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n22\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d   The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\n23\nGovernment.24\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n25\n6\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.25\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuidelines \u00b6 21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nGuidelines \u00b6 22. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent; and\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an\nalcohol rehabilitation program.\nThe government established its case under Guidelines \u00b6 22 (a) and (f).  Applicant had five\nalcohol related traffic charges over a 20-year period.  Even after attending alcohol awareness and\nrehabilitation programs he continued to drink alcohol.  \nGuidelines \u00b6 23. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a\npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making\nsatisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n26\nId.\n27\nId.\n28\n7\nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  His most recent alcohol related arrest was in 2005.\nEven after repeated court-ordered alcohol related traffic programs he continued to drink.  He stated\nhe stopped drinking two weeks before the hearing, primarily because of the security clearance\nprocess.  He has no established track record of abstinence.  He last attended an AA meeting six years\nago.  His program director that certified his completion of an alcohol program for education on\nOctober 12, 2007, was not a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker.\nI conclude  Guideline G against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n26\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n27\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (40),\n28\nhis education, his employment, and what might motivate him to continue his irresponsible conduct.\nThis case raises questions about his reliability and judgment.  Applicant is mature, has served 20-\nyears in the military, has had several alcohol awareness, etc., programs, and yet continued to drink\nand violate the law by driving under the influence.  His casual attitude to his use of alcohol and\ncontinued denial that he has a problem with alcohol is problematic.  His history of alcohol\nconsumption raises serious doubts about his ability to guarantee that such activity will not happen\nin the future.  He stopped drinking two weeks prior to the hearing primarily because of his security\nclearance.  His very recent decision to terminate his alcohol consumption is insufficient to justify a\nfinding of a \u201cpattern of abstinence\u201d or that he \u201cis making satisfactory progress.\u201d  The totality of the\nrecord raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified\ninformation and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the\ngovernment entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The PRC has a \npoor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices \ninclude arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners.  \n \nThe PRC is one of the most aggressive countries in targeting sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology, and economic intelligence. It has targeted the U.S. with \nactive intelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. In China, authorities have \nmonitored telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, \nand internet communications. Authorities opened and censored mail. The security \nservices routinely monitored and entered residences and offices to gain access to \ncomputers, telephones, and fax machines. All major hotels had a sizable internal \nsecurity presence, and hotel guestrooms were sometimes bugged and searched for \nsensitive or proprietary materials. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n6 \n \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, two half-sisters, two aunts, and an uncle are citizens \nand residents of the PRC. Her mother and brother are members of the Communist \nParty. The PRC has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Communist Party, \nwith a poor human rights record, and targets the U.S. for espionage. Applicant\u2019s foreign \nconnections create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion. They also create a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) have been raised by the evidence. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1, h, and 1.i are \nfactually true, but they are repetitious with other SOR allegations. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, \n1.g, 1, h, and 1.i are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has been in this country for more than 20 years and has been a U.S. \ncitizen since 2000. Her husband is an American citizen, as are one of her brothers and \none of her sisters. She has no foreign assets. She is a respected and valued employee. \n\n \n7 \n \nHowever, because of her extensive and close foreign family ties and the nature of that \nforeign country, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has a number of close family members who are citizens and residents \nof China. Her family was targeted for oppression by the Communist Party during the \nCultural Revolution of the 1960s. Two of her close relatives are members of the \nCommunist Party. The PRC has an authoritarian government, a bad human rights \nrecord, and has a very aggressive espionage program aimed at the U.S. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \n \nI considered all of Applicant\u2019s very favorable character evidence. She is a valued \nand trusted employee. She has done nothing whatsoever to question her loyalty and \ndevotion to this country. However, she has simply been unable to overcome the \u201cvery \nheavy burden\u201d of showing that neither she nor her family members in the PRC are \nsubject to influence by that country.8 Her vulnerability to foreign pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress remains a concern.  \n \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007). \n\n \n8 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 6, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On April 10, 2008, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which established that he had entered\ninto a repayment plan for his outstanding debts.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the\nJudge erred.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  The SOR alleged eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,000.  The\nJudge found in favor of Applicant as to two of the debts, because one was unsubstantiated and the\nother could be readily enforced, if necessary.  As for the other six debts, the Judge found that,\nsubsequent to the issuance of the SOR and just prior to the submission of the case for decision,\nApplicant had entered into a repay agreement with each of the creditors, and made a small payment\non each debt in furtherance thereof.  However, the Judge found against Applicant with respect to\nthose debts, concluding that Applicant\u2019s efforts to repay or resolve them had been \u201c. . . insufficient\nwhen compared to available income that he could have used to address his delinquent debts.\u201d\nDecision at 8.  In support of that adverse conclusion, the Judge noted that \u201cApplicant became aware\nof the security significance of his financial problems almost two years ago when an OPM\ninvestigator interviewed him concerning his delinquent debts.\u201d  Id.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He served on \nactive duty from 1982 to 2004, retiring in the grade of E-7. He served a tour in Korea in \n2000-2001 and a tour in Iraq in 2003-2004 (Item 6 at 3).  He held a security clearance \nsince 1982 without security violations. After retirement he was hired by a contractor.  \nHis spouse was unemployed from 2001 to 2003 (Item 6 at 3). Her unemployment, family \nmoves to a new home in a different state, making payments on two residences and \nother retirement expenses caused their financial problems (Item 6 at 3).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR lists eight delinquent debts totaling about $24,000. He disputed a state \ntax lien for taxes from 1992 because he was on active duty and not a resident of that \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Feb. 15, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated Feb. 22, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant \nthat he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n5Item 4 (2005 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nstate. On March 5, 2008, he paid the remaining creditors amounts ranging from $50 to \n$150 for a total of $600. He made sufficient payments on his debt to the Army and Air \nForce Exchange System (AAFES) to satisfy AAFES. However, he made insufficient \nprogress resolving six debts totaling about $16,000. Specific information about each of \nthe eight SOR debts listed in \u00b6 1 follows:  \n \na. State tax debt of $2,250 filed on January 24, 2000, for tax year 1992.  \nApplicant disputed the debt because he was a non-resident of that state on military \norders. In his response to the FORM, he said he recently received the form to apply for \na non-resident exemption. He did not provide a copy of the completed application for \nthe non-resident exemption.  The record establishes he was on active duty from 1992 to \n1994 when he served in the state with the tax lien.  He was not born in the state with the \ntax lien, did not attend college or marry in the state with the tax lien, and did not retire in \nthat state. I conclude he was not a resident of the state with the tax lien, and this debt is \nunsubstantiated.  \n \nb. Financial debt of $1,440 charged off in July 2001. In his response to the \nFORM, he said he agreed to pay the creditor $50 monthly. On March 5, 2008, he paid \nthe creditor $50 (Response to FORM at Encl 2). \n \nc. Financial debt of $984 charged off or placed for collection in about January \n2002.  In his response to the FORM, he said he agreed to pay the creditor $50 monthly. \nOn March 5, 2008, he paid the creditor $50 (Response to FORM at Encl 2). \n \nd. Financial debt of $1,082 charged off or placed for collection in about August \n2003. In his response to the FORM, he said he agreed to pay the creditor $150 and \nthen $50 monthly. On March 5, 2008, he paid the creditor $100 (Response to FORM at \nEncl 2). \n \ne. Financial debt of $2,312 charged off or placed for collection in about \nDecember 2003. In his response to the FORM, he said he agreed to pay the creditor \n$50 monthly. On March 5, 2008, he paid the creditor $50 (Response to FORM at Encl \n2). \n \nf. Financial debt of $7,718 charged off or placed for collection in about February \n2004.6 In his response to the FORM, he said he agreed to pay the creditor $100 \nmonthly. On March 5, 2008, he paid the creditor $100 (Response to FORM at Encl 2). \n \ng. Army and Air Force Exchange System (AAFES) financial debt for $5,022 \ncharged off or placed for collection in about June 2005. From August 2005 to December \n2005, he made five payments. In June 2007, he made a $150 payment. On March 5, \n2008, he paid AAFES $150 (Response to FORM at Encl 2). AAFES has access to \n \n6 On March 11, 2002, he wrote the creditor disputing $800 because parts were missing from a \nbed his wife received on August 8, 2000 (Item 3 at 13, 16). A letter from the creditor, dated July 9, 2002, \nindicated the debt amount for furniture was $3,610, and the debt was filed as disputed (Item 3 at 11). A \nletter dated November 29, 2002 from the creditor noted the claim that side rails to a water bed were not \ndelivered, and sought further documentation or an estimate to repair the damage (Item 3 at 9).   \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s retirement pay, and if dissatisfied with his payments can readily obtain \nadditional funds.  I find For Applicant on this debt.     \n \nh. Financial debt for $3,518 charged off or placed for collection in about June \n2007, he made a $100 payment. On March 5, 2008, he paid the creditor $100 \n(Response to FORM at Encl 2). \n \nApplicant and his spouse receive about $6,355 monthly in net pay.7 Their \nexpenses such as rent, food, clothing and utilities total about $4,800 monthly. $1,500 \nmonthly remains for debt payments.  Applicant met with a credit counselor and received \ncounseling about his debts (Item 3 at 2). \n   \nApplicant had ample warning about the security concerns of his delinquent debt. \nOn May 16, 2006, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed \nApplicant concerning his delinquent debts (Item 6 at 3). On June 21, 2007, Applicant \nresponded to interrogatories from DOHA concerning his delinquent debts (Item 5). The \nSOR is dated December 6, 2007.  Other than the payments made on March 5, 2008, he \nhas done little to resolve the six nontax, non-AAFES related delinquent debts.  \n    \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n7 Item 5 at 6 is the source for the facts in this paragraph. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d8 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n \n8 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n9 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his OPM \ninterview, his DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response and his FORM response. He did \nnot make sufficient progress on six of his eight SOR-listed debts. Those six debts were \ndelinquent for several years. The government established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant became aware of the security significance of his financial problems on \nMay 16, 2006, when an OPM investigator interviewed him concerning his delinquent \ndebts. The importance of resolving his debts was reinforced when he received the SOR \nin December 2007. However, his efforts to resolve his debts were insufficient. He \nreceived financial counseling, and made $600 in payments on March 5, 2008. However, \nhe had more than $600 remaining each month from his family\u2019s income that remained \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \neach month that could have been used beginning months before he received the FORM \nto pay down his delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant agreed he was responsible for the debts listed on the SOR. He \ncurrently has significant unresolved debt. His overall conduct with his creditors casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There are not clear \nindications his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. He did not \nestablish that he made a good faith effort to repay or resolve debts totaling about \n$16,000, as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f and 1.h.    \n \nApplicant raised three circumstances beyond his control which partially mitigate \nsecurity concerns: (1) his wife was unemployed from 2001 to 2003; (2) his family \nneeded to move after he retired from the Army; and (3) there were other retirement \nexpenses such as maintenance of two households at the same time. However, he did \nnot show sufficient responsibility under the circumstances to mitigate security concerns. \nHe and his wife have both been employed for more than two years after he retired, and \nshould be able to show a consistent track record of delinquent debt reduction. His \nfinancial problems are continuing and likely to recur. He should have been more diligent \nand made greater efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. He has not carried his burden \nof proving his financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as \na whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. He served 22 years \non active duty and honorably retired from the Army. His active service included a \ncombat tour in Iraq. He held a security clearance for 22 years without a security \nviolation. He received financial counseling. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant became aware of the security significance of his financial problems almost \ntwo years ago when an OPM investigator interviewed him concerning his delinquent \ndebts. However, his efforts to resolve his debts were insufficient when compared to \navailable income that he could have used to address his delinquent debt. He did not \nadequately apply the financial counseling for timely resolution of his debts. Although he \nmade $600 in payments on March 5, 2008, he had additional money left over that he \ncould have used beginning months before he received the FORM to pay down or make \nmuch greater progress on his delinquent debts. In sum, he did not make sufficient \nefforts to repay or resolve debts totaling about $16,000, as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, 1.f and 1.h.         \n \n  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d10 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:` \n \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n10See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nDecision at 2.\n1\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 31, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 26, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline C is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge found Applicant, a U.S. citizen by birth, had applied for and received Latvian\ncitizenship.  In March 1996, she applied for and received a Latvian passport.  That passport expired\nin March 2006 and Applicant renewed it the same month.  It will not expire until March 2016.\nApplicant retains this Latvian passport; she has not destroyed or surrendered it.  Applicant traveled\nto Latvia in 1997, five times between 2003 and 2004, and in 2006.  She maintains her Latvian\ncitizenship, in part, because she stands to inherit property in Latvia.1\n  \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the\nJudge\u2019s findings contain multiple errors.  Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision\nshould be reversed because she had informed her security officer that she was obtaining Latvian\ncitizenship and a Latvian passport, and was under the reasonable belief that she had approval to due\nso.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record.  To\nthe extent that there is error, the errors are harmless error in that they would not change the outcome\n\nFor example, Applicant states her age is 46, not 47; she states she applied for Latvian citizenship because she\n2\nwas given an opportunity to due so, not for the purpose of inheriting land; she states while in Latvia she did not speak\nwith a person about the value of her father\u2019s property, but about other properties; she states that she did not say she\nintends to build a summer home in Latvia someday in the future, only that there was a hypothetical scenario 20 years in\nth future.  She might possibly build a summer home, but she had no specific plans to due so at this time.\nDecision at 5.\n3\n3\nof the case.   Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\n2\nconcern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the\npossible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited\nby Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Therefore, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cit is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d3\nis sustainable.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan  \nMichael Y.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James W. Green, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 1,\n2006. On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline C\n(Foreign Preference) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 5, 2007. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on October 16, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 19, 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on November 7, 2007, and I received the case\nassignment on November 13, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until\nJanuary 17, 2008, in order for her counsel to be available. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on December 19, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January\n17, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were received\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n2\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A\nthrough W, AA and BB, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on January 29, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 16, 2007, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations in the SOR, except Subparagraph 1.d which she denied, with her\nexplanations. Her counsel submitted a denial of all allegations on October 30, 2007,\nalong with his request for a hearing and a notice of representation.  She also provided\nadditional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant is 47 years old, unmarried, and employed as a manager for a defense\ncontractor.  She has had a security clearance since 1984.  She was born in the United\nStates.  Her parents were born in Latvia (in the Baltic Sea region) before World War II\nand immigrated to the United States after the war.  They became naturalized U.S.\ncitizens.  Latvia was part of the Soviet Union after the war.  It regained it independence\nin the 1990s.  Applicant has one sister who was born and lives in the United States. (Tr.\n30-32; Exhibits 1, 3)\nOn June 27, 1995, Applicant applied for Latvian citizenship.  She read in a\nLatvian community publication in her hometown that the opportunity for dual citizenship\nwith Latvia existed, and she took advantage of the opportunity.  She informed her\nemployer about her application.  A Government investigator interviewed her about the\napplication, and she retained her security clearance thereafter.  Applicant applied for\nand received a Latvian passport on March 11, 1996.  It expired on March 10, 2006, and\nApplicant received another Latvian passport effective on March 24, 2006, which expires\non March 23, 2016.  Applicant retains this passport currently and has not destroyed or\nsurrendered it.  She also has a U.S. passport, which she uses for traveling outside the\nUnited States for business and pleasure.  Applicant applied for Latvian citizenship, she\nclaims, for the purpose of inheriting land in Latvia, or its equivalent value, owned before\nWorld War II by her father\u2019s family.  Applicant claims Latvian citizenship is required for\ninheriting under Latvian law.  Applicant\u2019s sister has not obtained dual citizenship. (Tr.\n34-50, 58, 61, 62; Exhibits 1-3, T-W)  \nApplicant traveled to Latvia in May 1997, and again five times between April\n2003 and November 2004.  She traveled there again in March 2006.  During some of\nthese trips in 2003 and 2004, she spoke with a person about the value of her father\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s property.  Her father intends for Applicant to inherit any land in Latvia deeded to\nhim as part of this compensation package from the Latvian government.  She is the only\nfamily member to receive this property after her father. Applicant has an emotional\nattachment to the land, and intends to build a summer home there someday in the\nfuture. (Tr. 43, 48-55, 61-63, 78; Exhibits 2, 3)\n\n3\nApplicant would surrender her dual citizenship if it were a condition to retaining\nher security clearance.  She also would be willing to destroy her Latvian passport\nconditioned on the renewal of her security clearance.  She has not destroyed her\nLatvian passport yet. (Tr. 44, 56, 57, 64)\nApplicant is highly regarded in her company for her technical competency and\nwork ethic.  She submitted numerous character statements.  Two character witnesses\ntestified on her behalf about their interaction and work experience with Applicant. (Tr.\n12-29; Exhibits A-S, AA, BB)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines are in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n4\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG & 9:      \nGuideline C:  The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he\nor she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 10(a)1, \u201cthe possession of a current foreign passport,\u201d and \u00b6 10(a)5, \u201cusing\nforeign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country.\u201d  The\nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions.  In 1995, Applicant applied for and received Latvian citizenship\nfor the purpose of inheriting land in Latvia.  In 1996, she applied for a Latvian passport,\nwhich she renewed in 2006.  It does not expire until 2016.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising under the Foreign Influence guideline.  The burden shifted to Applicant\nto rebut or mitigate the allegations.  Under AG \u00b6 11, there are six potential Mitigating\nConditions (MC).  There are only two that are possibly applicable.  \u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d and \u00b6 11 (e), \u201cthe\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated.\u201d While Applicant testified she would renounce her dual\ncitizenship, it was only as a condition for retaining her security clearance.  She has the\nwillingness to renounce, but it is contingent on the Government\u2019s favorable action on\nher security clearance.  More determinative, however, is the fact that she retains a\ncurrent Latvian passport, and has not destroyed it.  She would only destroy it if the\nGovernment first granted her a security clearance renewal.  However, the MC requires\nthe passport be destroyed or invalidated before the Government considers granting the\nsecurity clearance.  \n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In the present case, there is much\ninformation about positive attributes of Applicant\u2019s life and work history.  However, they\nare insufficient to outweigh the fact Applicant refuses to destroy or invalidate her Latvian\npassport.  Consequently, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under foreign preference.  Accordingly, Guideline C is decided\nagainst her. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In his response to the SOR, he stated that the \u201cProvidian account\nwas an erroneous entry.\u201d\nApplicant is indebted to NCOINOMED in the approximate amount of $1,761.00\non an account placed for collection.\nApplicant is indebted to Credit Protection in the approximate amount of $52.00\non a delinquent account referred for collection by Susquehanna Communication in\n2001. During his interview with the OPM investigator, applicant stated this was for a\ncable bill that he did not pay before moving out of the country. In his response to the\nSOR, he stated this debt was \u201ccleared\u201d prior to leaving the U.S. and the account was\nclosed.\nApplicant is indebted to Alltel Pennsylvania in the approximate amount of\n$483.00 on an account that was referred to FRST COLL SRV for collection in 2001.\nDuring the interview with the OPM investigator, applicant stated this debt was for a\nphone bill that was not paid prior to he and his family moving out of the country. In his\nresponse to the SOR, applicant stated \u201cthis bill will have to be reviewed.\u201d\nApplicant is indebted to Cavalry in the approximate amount of $11,903.00. This\nauto debt was referred to Cavalry for collection by Americredit in 2002. According to\napplicant\u2019s statement to the OPM investigator, \u201cthis could be the debt remaining after\n[one of applicant\u2019s vehicles] was sold after repossession. Applicant blames the lender\nfor the problem and will not pay the debt.\nApplicant is indebted to DEFENSE on a government debt in the approximate\namount of $1,878.00. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated he \u201cis not sure what\nthis account is for.\u201d\nA Personal Financial Statement from January 2007 indicates applicant had a\npositive monthly cash flow of approximately $3,704.00. In his response to the SOR\napplicant disputed this information. He explained that this figure included his wife\u2019s\nmonthly income, but for privacy reasons did not include her debts.\n\n3\nApplicant completed an electronic questionnaire for national security positions\n(EQNSP) in January 2006. In response to two questions on the EQNSP, applicant\ndenied that (1) in the prior seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt and (2) he was then over 90 days delinquent on any debts. As documented above,\napplicant was well over 180 days delinquent on many debts when he completed the\nEQNSP. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated he did not list his debts on the\nEQNSP \u201cbecause at the time [he] purchased his home [in December 2005] [he] was told\nthat most of the debts on [his] credit report had been charged off and [he] assumed [he]\ndid not need to list these debts as they were charged off.\u201d I find that applicant\nintentionally provided the false information.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nUnder Paragraph c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security\nconcerns. The evidence shows applicant has a long history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph a. may apply where\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his\nfinancial obligations is both recent and frequent. The evidence does not support a\nfinding that his financial irresponsibility will not recur. Accordingly, this mitigation\ncondition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\npresented no credible evidence that would justify application of this mitigating condition.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\n\n5\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false,\nmaterial information on an EQNSP.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.c., an \u201callegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s intentional misrepresentation\nof material facts on the 2006 EQNSP (a felony under 18 U.S.C. 1001) raise these two\ndisqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n6\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations. In addition, he lied to the Government\nin January 2006 when he denied any delinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s inability or\nunwillingness to honor his financial obligations and to be truthful about them is serious\nand recent, and preclude findings that applicant\u2019s financial difficulties will not recur and\nthat applicant is unlikely to provide false information to the Government in the future.\nBased on the foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns\narising from Guidelines E, F and J.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nsubmitted an answer to the SOR, received by DOHA on August 28, 2007, in which he\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n The entire FORM consists of the SOR, Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, a security clearance\n2\napplication, a credit report, interrogatories that are unanswered except for a brief letter from Applicant\nattached thereto, and Department Counsel\u2019s written submission. Accordingly, the FORM reveals very little\ninformation about Applicant or the cause of his delinquent indebtedness.  \n2\nadmitted all Guideline F allegations and denied both Guideline E allegations. Applicant\nrequested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on\nNovember 2, 2007, that was mailed to Applicant on November 5, 2007. Applicant was\ninformed he had 30 days from receipt of the documents to submit his objections or\ninformation he wished to be considered. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM\nor object to anything contained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case was\nassigned to me on January 28, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits,  I make the following findings of fact:\n2\nApplicant is a 55-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor\nsince April 1979, currently as a quality technician. He was married in June 1971, and that\nmarriage ended in divorce in November 1983. He has been remarried since November\n1988. Applicant has three adult children and three adult step-children. He has resided in\nthe same residence since November 1988.\nAs alleged in the SOR, and admitted by Applicant, a judgment was entered against\nhim in the amount of $1,459 in July 2006, on an account that was charged off in October\n2004. Applicant has failed to take any action to resolve this account. Also, as alleged in the\nSOR and admitted by Applicant, he has three accounts that have been submitted for\ncollection, totalling $10,659, and two additional accounts that have been charged off,\ntotalling $12,206. The collection and charge off accounts have been delinquent at least two\nyears or more. Additionally, Applicant owned a timeshare that was foreclosed on in\nNovember 2004.\nApplicant failed to disclose any of the delinquent accounts in an Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) he executed and submitted on or\nabout November 29, 2006, in response to questions inquiring about debts that were then\nmore than 90 days past due or had been more than 180 days past due in the preceding\n7 years. Applicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing the debts was that his wife took care of\npaying all bills and he was unaware he had any delinquent debts. Applicant stated in his\nresponse to the SOR that his delinquent indebtedness was due to his failure to live within\nhis means. His only plan to pay off the indebtedness is from an inheritance he expects to\nreceive when his father-in-law dies.        \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n3\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), and Guideline E (personal conduct) with their respective DC and MC, are\nmost relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n11\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has six debts, totalling over $24,000, that have been charged off,\nsubmitted for collection, or that have resulted in a judgment being entered against him.\nThose debts have been delinquent since July 2005 and earlier. Additionally, Applicant had\na timeshare he owned foreclosed on in November 2004. He has made no payments on\nany of the debts and has no plan to resolved them other than to wait until his father-in-law\ndies with the expectation that he will inherit sufficient funds from the man to pay his\ndelinquent creditors. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. I have\nconsidered all potential mitigating conditions under Guideline F and find none apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not listing the delinquent indebtedness is not credible.\nIt is unbelievable he could be so ignorant of what is and has been occurring within his\nhousehold that he would be unaware of a judgment being entered against him, a time\nshare being foreclosed, or creditors undoubtedly making efforts to collect on long-standing\ndelinquent accounts. Further, his knowledge of what has in fact been occurring with his\nfinances is clearly demonstrated by his acknowledgment in his answer to the SOR that he\nhas failed to live with his means. DC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personal security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, of similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\n\n5\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies. I have considered all mitigating\nconditions under Guideline E and find none apply.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept based upon what little is known about Applicant, the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying conditions,\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by the financial considerations\npresent in this case and his personal conduct. He has failed to overcome the case against\nhim or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guidelines F and E are decided against\nApplicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on May \n13, 2006. On May 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines \nF (Financial Considerations), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct) for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \nIn an undated Answer, received by DOHA on June 2, 2008, Applicant responded \nto the SOR allegations. He elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated July 29, \n2008, was provided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Submissions were due by \nSeptember 7, 2008. Applicant timely submitted additional material. On September 4, \n2008, Department Counsel interposed no objection to Application\u2019s submissions. The \ncase was assigned to me on September 9, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.f., 2.a. \u2013 \n2.e., and neither admitted or denied 3.a. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and has worked for \nthis employer since March 2006. He graduated form high school in June 1994, and \nattended a university from September 1996 to December 1997. Applicant has never \nbeen married and has no dependents.2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation included the review of his SF 85P,3 local  \npolice department\u2019s December 2007 response to DOHA\u2019s request for records,4 his \nFebruary 2008 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories,5 his second February 2008 \nResponse to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories,6 his July 2006 and April 2008 credit bureau \nreports,7 and his July 2006 FBI Identification Record.8  \n \n1 DOHA transmittal letter is dated July 29, 2008; and Applicant received the FORM on August 8, \n2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to \nsubmit information. \n2 Item 4. \n3 Id. \n4 Item 5. \n5 Item 6. \n6 Item 7. \n7 Items 8 and 9. \n8 Item 10.  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nThe Government established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented \nthat Applicant had or has six delinquent debts totaling approximately $3,804. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. \u2013 1.e.) Of those debts, one was a defaulted student loan for $1,926. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \nThe remaining five debts consist of five collection accounts in the amounts of $718, \n$745, $209, $136, and $70. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. \u2013 2.f.) His record of indebtedness goes back \nto at least 2000 and has been ongoing.9  \n \nIn his Response to SOR, Applicant offered no documentation that any of his \ndebts have been paid, that he had set up payment plans, nor has he submitted any \nevidence that he contacted any creditors or sought credit counseling or that his debts \nare or will be resolved. In his Response to FORM, he submitted a letter from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education dated February 6, 2008, stating that his student loan has been \ntransferred from the Default Resolution Group back to the Direct Loan Servicing Center. \nThe letter further advised that his student loan had been rehabilitated and that the \nnational credit bureaus were notified to delete the record of default from his credit \nrecord. Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM contains no further documentation regarding \nany other debts identified in the SOR. \n \nApplicant was interviewed in January 2007 by an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) Investigator. During that Interview, Applicant stated that all of his \naccounts became delinquent \u201cbecause he was not making any money due to being in \nbetween jobs a lot.\u201d10 \n \nIn December 2002, Applicant was cited for speeding and reckless driving, and \nwas convicted in the same month and year of reckless driving. He was fined $100, \nordered to pay court costs, and to attend traffic school. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) In January 2004, \nApplicant was fired from his job for engaging in inappropriate e-mail/internet activities. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b.) He explained that he responded to a sexually explicit e-mail that he \nreceived, adding that no images were transmitted, just inappropriate language.11  \n \nIn December 2004, Applicant was cited for a seatbelt violation. This ticket was \nreported past due in January 2005. (SOR \u00b6 2.c.) In August 2005, Applicant was charged \nwith 1st degree wanton endangerment and 4th degree domestic violence minor injury \nassault. In February 2006, he was convicted of the 4th degree assault, and sentenced to \ntime served (two days), and ordered to pay court costs. He was placed on two years \nprobation (one year supervised), and completed his probation in February 2008. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d.) \n \nIn February 2006, he was arrested and cited for having an expired registration \nand for failing to maintain the required insurance. He was ordered to pay $130 in court \ncosts. (SOR \u00b6 2.e.)  \n \n \n9 Items 8 and 9. \n \n10 Item 7 at p. I-13. \n \n \n11 Item 6. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant did not submit any reference or character evidence not did he submit \nany other evidence in Response to SOR or Response to FORM except as noted. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated six delinquent accounts, totaling \napproximately $3,804, that consisted of five charged off as bad debts, and one student \nloan that went into default. His indebtedness began in 2000 and has been ongoing. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a \ncloser examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Applicant submitted evidence \nthat his student loan has been returned to good standing. He submitted no evidence \nthat he has made any progress in resolving the remaining five collection accounts. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant has failed to \ndemonstrate that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, as required by AG \u00b6 \n20(b). Applicant\u2019s only explanation regarding his indebtedness was found in his OPM \nInterview in which stated that all of his accounts became delinquent \u201cbecause he was \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nnot making any money due to being in between jobs a lot.\u201d This blanket statement in \ninsufficient to warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Other than \ndocumenting payment of his student loan, Applicant has fallen short on showing that he \nhas paid or otherwise resolved the remaining debts. Under this mitigating condition, I \nam able to give Applicant credit for rehabilitating his defaulted student loan default listed \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. I am unable to apply any mitigating conditions to the remaining five \ncollection accounts listed under this concern given the fact that Applicant provided no \nfavorable evidence. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant incurred three traffic violations between 2002 and 2006. In January 2004, he \nwas fired for workplace misconduct for responding to a sexually explicit e-mail. Finally, \nApplicant was arrested in January 2005 and charged with 1st degree wanton \nendangerment and 4th degree assault and received two years probation (one year \nsupervised). Under AG \u00b6 16(d),  \n \n[C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, potential conditions that could mitigate this security concern \ninclude: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nI specifically considered the mitigating conditions supra and conclude they do not \napply. Applicant=s identified conduct under this concern consists of five separate \nincidents spanning a four year period from 2002 to 2006. Taken together, these \nincidents preclude a finding that they are unlikely to recur. Doubt remains about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe single allegation under Guideline J is a cross-allegation of the Guideline E \nconcern over Applicant\u2019s 2005 domestic violence assault conviction. This offense is \nsufficient to apply two disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent arrest brings to the forefront the criminal conduct concerns \nraised by his past behavior. I am required to consider Applicant\u2019s overall questionable \nbehavior when evaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the SOR to \ndetermine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is recent; the likelihood of \nrecurrence; Applicant\u2019s explanations or lack thereof concerning the circumstances of the \nincidents alleged; and his rehabilitation.12 I conclude, however, that the only \nsubstantiated criminal offense is in SOR \u00b6 2.d. The Government did not prove the other \noffenses are crimes, as opposed to traffic offenses. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 32, potential conditions that could mitigate this security concern \ninclude: \n \n12 ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is \nrecent and not isolated. Considering his criminal behavior, the nature and seriousness \nof his misconduct, and lack of mitigating evidence, I am unable to apply any of the \nmitigating conditions supra. His behavior raises questions about his ability and \nwillingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information.  \n \nAdditionally, for the same reasons outlined under the discussions of Guidelines \nF, E and J, incorporated herein, I conclude Applicant=s behavior shows questionable \njudgment, lack of reliability, and untrustworthiness.  \n \nThe \nobjective \nof \na \ntrustworthiness \ndetermination \nis \nthe \nfair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nsensitive information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a \nperson by the totality of his acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own \nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound \njudgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \n \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this \ncase, the whole person concept, the facts listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the \nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised. He has not overcome the case against him \nand satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d13 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nKevin McCants, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 13 August 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nE.  Applicant answered the SOR 7 September 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 20 December 2007, and I convened a hearing 19 February\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 27 February 2008. \nMarch 31,2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nBy motion dated 6 December 2007, Department Counsel moved to strike SOR\nallegation 1.b. Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion (Tr. 6). \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted that her fianc\u00e9 is an illegal alien (SOR 1.a.), that they jointly\nown property in Mexico (SOR 1.d.), and that her prospective in-laws are resident\ncitizens of Mexico, to whom they have sent support money (SOR 1.e.). She denied the\nremaining SOR allegations. She is a 31-year-old program management specialist\nemployed by a defense contractor since April 2007. She seeks to retain the security\nclearance she has held since June 2003, when she was employed by a different\ncontractor.\nIn September 2002, Applicant and her best friend were teaching an English as a\nsecond language (ESL) class in a church-sponsored outreach program for the local\nHispanic community. Among their students were two brothers originally from Mexico.\nUnknown to Applicant and her friend, the two brothers were in the U.S. illegally. By the\nend of 2002, Applicant and her best friend had developed a friendship with the two\nbrothers and their cousin. As they got to know the brothers better still, the relationships\nmoved beyond teacher/pupil. In January 2004, Applicant learned that the brothers were\nillegal aliens when her mother had a job for one of them and he could not produce the\nsocial security number necessary for employment.\nApplicant\u2019s best friend started dating the other brother, and after a short\nengagement, they married in December 2004. Before they married, he had to comply\nwith U.S. immigration requirements to remedy his illegal alien status. That procedure\nrequired him to return to Mexico, pay a fine, and obtain a waiver of disqualification (for\nhaving previously been in the U.S. illegally), as pre-conditions for obtaining his fianc\u00e9\nvisa (Tr. 33). He is now a legal permanent resident (LPR) of the U.S., awaiting the day\nhe can apply for citizenship.\nAlthough Applicant learned of her fiance\u2019s illegal status in January 2004 (he had\nentered the U.S. illegally in January 2001), she started dating him during summer 2004.\nWhile they are not yet officially engaged, they decided to get married in fall 2005. They\nare currently working their way through the immigration requirements to remedy his\nillegal status, although he remains in the U.S. However, in December 2005, Applicant\nthought this process might require her to travel to Mexico, so she contacted her\ncompany security officer about her prospective travel. The ensuing discussions\ndeveloped the details of her relationship with her fianc\u00e9, and resulted in the company\u2019s\nJanuary 2006 adverse information report (G.E. 1).\nIn the meantime, a friend had given Applicant an old mobile home, which she\nrelocated to family property owned by her father. She placed it on a part of the property\n\n3\nher father intended to deed to her after the parcel was surveyed. Applicant thought she\ncould rehabilitate the mobile home and use it as a rental property. Applicant, her father,\nand her fianc\u00e9 rehabilitated the mobile home, and Applicant took out a loan to dig the\nwell and septic tank required to get an occupancy permit for the mobile home. In\nOctober 2005, she bought a used truck to help transport tools and materials to the site.\nWhen the work was completed, she rented the mobile home to her fianc\u00e9, who pays her\n$400 per month. He moved into the mobile home in March 2006. He has lived there\nsince, at various times with a third brother (known by Applicant to be in the U.S.\nillegally) and several cousins (presumed by Applicant to be in the U.S. illegally)(G.E. 3).\nShe has never asked her fianc\u00e9 about the legal status of his cousins (Tr. 66). As far as\nshe is concerned, the residence of the third brother and cousins in the mobile home is\nbetween her fianc\u00e9 and them.\nIn summer 2006, Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 bought an acre of land in Mexico, near\nhis parents, for $500. They plan to build a small home there in the next five years,\nwhere they can stay when they visit family. They also hope to use the home to house\nmissionaries from their church when they travel to Mexico to work with the poor. In fall\n2006, Applicant gave her truck to her prospective father-in-law (and her fianc\u00e9 paid the\nshipping costs) because he had greater use for it than she did. He is now able to drive\nto the nearby town for medical treatment and supplies for the family, and can transport\nwater to the ranch from a nearby river instead of having to transport it by donkey. In\naddition, she and her fianc\u00e9 have sent various amounts of money for gifts and other\nsupport over the last several years, not exceeding $2000.\nApplicant never considered her fiance\u2019s illegal immigration status as a barrier to\nher dating him. She never considered any security implications for her due to his status\nbecause she did not see him as breaking the law. She had no qualms about renting her\nmobile home to him as an illegal alien (Tr. 50-55). In her January 2007 sworn statement\nto a government investigator (G.E. 3), a document she drafted, she was unwilling to\nname her fiance\u2019s employer for fear of action against the owner for employing an illegal\nalien. She was similarly unwilling to disclose his actual residence address given his\nillegal status and risk of immigration action against him. She reiterated those concerns\nat hearing (Tr. 61).\nApplicant\u2019s manager since January 2004, who is aware of her foreign national\nissues, has no concerns over her candor or her continued access to classified\ninformation. Her character references (her church pastor who has known her since she\nwas a teenager and her best friend who married her fiance\u2019s brother) consider her\nfaithful and honest.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\n3\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may\nnot properly safeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered\nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when\ncombined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ; (g)\nassociation with persons involved in criminal activity.\n4\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommon sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against\nApplicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the\nevidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Her romantic involvement with an\nillegal alien, her providing him and his relatives (also illegal aliens) with shelter, her joint\npurchase of foreign property, her providing support to his family in Mexico, and her\ninability to recognize how any of this might raise security concerns, raise serious issues\nabout her judgment and reliability.3\n\n5\nIt was probably not unreasonable for Applicant and her best friend to undertake\nteaching an ESL class to the local Hispanic community under the auspices of their\nchurch, without inquiring of the immigration status of any of the students. In that context,\nI would be loathe to impute a responsibility for her or her church to pursue that\ninformation. However, once her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 and his brother began to\ntake on a more personal tone, to the point where she became aware of his illegal\npresence in the U.S., she became responsible for considering how her relationship with\nher fianc\u00e9, and his criminal conduct, might potentially affect her employment or her\nclearance.\nHer joint purchase of foreign property and her financial support to her fiance\u2019s\nfamily in Mexico begin to raise foreign influence concerns. Her personal assistance to\nher fianc\u00e9, by helping him find employment and renting him housing knowing his illegal\nstatus, raise criminal conduct concerns, whether her conduct is directly criminal or\nmerely aiding and abetting his criminal conduct. The fact that she first started becoming\ncloser friends with her fianc\u00e9 as early as December 2002, yet did not disclose that\nrelationship to her facility security officer until December 2005\u2014and then only because\nof her potential foreign travel\u2014raises its own judgment issues. Her willingness to ignore\nthe immigration status of her fianc\u00e9 as well as the family members he permitted to live\nwith him in the mobile home she rented to him demonstrates further poor judgment.\nSimilarly, her unwillingness to disclose any information about her fianc\u00e9 that would\nidentify his employer or his living address constitutes poor judgment.\nThe government successfully articulates three issues of security concern raised\nby Applicant\u2019s conduct cognizable under Guideline E. First, her conduct\u2014and her\ninability to recognize the security concerns raised by it\u2014constitute poor judgment.\nSecond, she has placed herself in a position where she might be subject to duress or\ncoercion over the possibility her fianc\u00e9 or his employer might be revealed to\nimmigrations authorities. She might also be subject to duress or coercion for her\ncomplicity in her fiance\u2019s criminal conduct. Finally, her unwillingness to disclose\ncomplete information about her fianc\u00e9 or her prospective in-laws in Mexico prevents the\ngovernment from fully investigating her background. Her explanations of how she does\nnot view her fiance\u2019s conduct as criminal or how she believes that her association with\nher fianc\u00e9 and his other illegal-alien family members does not affect her security\nresponsibilities only heightens the security concerns raised by her personal situation.

Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated December 1, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.g-1.j of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f and 1.k of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant, who is 44 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor, as an electrical engineer. He began his employment with this contractor in August 2005. He completed his security clearance application shortly thereafter. Applicant previously held a security clearance in the late 1990s without incident. 2 Applicant was born and raised in Syria. He immigrated to the United States (U.S.) in 1984 at the age of 20. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1990. He travels on his U.S. passport.

On October 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 25, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on December 1, 2007, and requested a hearing\nJune 24, 2008\n\nAE A through U are attached to his response to the SOR. AE V was not admitted into evidence.\n1\n2\nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received the request in early December 2008.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 20, 2008. DOHA assigned\nthis case to another administrative judge on December 27, 2007. For case load\nmanagement, this case was transferred to me on January 9, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on January 22, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nFebruary 13, 2008. The government offered two exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and two witnesses\ntestified on his behalf. He submitted ten exhibits (AE) V through EE, which were\nreceived and marked. AE W through EE were admitted into evidence without objection.1\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on April 1, 2008. (Tr. 6-7.) At the hearing, I\nadvised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before\nthe hearing. After consulting with counsel, Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15\ndays notice. (Tr. 6-7.) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following\nallegations:\n\u00b6 1.l \u201cYour three brother-in-laws and one sister-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of Syria.\u201d\n\u00b6 1.m \u201cYour two sister-in-laws are citizens of Syria and residents of\nKuwait\u201d\n \n(Tr. 127-131, 134).\nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to the motion, arguing that Department Counsel had not\nshown attenuation and lack of notice for failing to raise the allegation sooner. He also\nargued that the lack of notice denied Applicant his due process rights. \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request to amend the SOR and allowed the\nparties additional time to develop the evidence as noted above. Tr. 131-133,165.\nApplicant\u2019s counsel decided to file a written response to the new allegations. On March\n4, 2008, I received the response and three additional exhibits, which have been marked\nand admitted as AE FF through HH. Department Counsel requested additional hearing\ntestimony from Applicant. DOHA issued a second Notice of Hearing on March 19, 2008.\nI convened the second hearing as scheduled on April 10, 2008. DOHA received the\ntranscripts of the hearing (Tr.) on February 22, 2008 and April 18, 2008 respectively.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated November 14, 2005) at 2, 9, 32-33; Tr. 86-88.\n2\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 2-4, 8, 14-16, 21-22; AE HH (Daughter\u2019s birth certificate).\n3\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 19-28; Tr. 43-46, 54-79.\n4\n3\nDepartment Counsel submitted a written closing on April 24, 2008. Applicant\u2019s counsel\nsubmitted written closing argument on May 8, 2008. Department Counsel did not submit\nany rebuttal argument. The record closed on May 15, 2008.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Syria, Kuwait and Qatar, but withdrew its request that I take\nadministrative notice of certain facts related to Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 13-18, 133-135.) The\nrequest and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but were\nincluded in the record as Administrative Exhibit I through XIII. Applicant\u2019s counsel\nargued that the facts administratively noticed must be limited to matters of general\nknowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute.  The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 1, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.g-1.j of the SOR, with explanations. He\ndenied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f and 1.k of the SOR. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 44 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor, as\nan electrical engineer. He began his employment with this contractor in August 2005.\nHe completed his security clearance application shortly thereafter. Applicant previously\nheld a security clearance in the late 1990s without incident.    \n2\nApplicant was born and raised in Syria. He immigrated to the United States\n(U.S.) in 1984 at the age of 20. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1990. He\ntravels on his U.S. passport. He attended a major university in the U.S., from which he\nreceived a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1995. He married his\npresent wife in 1997 and has three children, two sons and a daughter. His children are\nU.S. citizens by birth and his wife is a naturalized citizen. 3\nApplicant\u2019s father became a U.S. citizen in 2004. He was born and raised in Syria\nand retains his Syrian citizenship. Applicant\u2019s mother, eight brothers, and two sisters\nwere born in Syria and are citizens of Syria. One brother lives and works in Qatar as a\nchef. His other siblings live and work in Syria.  \n4\n\nId.\n5\nTr. 97-102, 109.\n6\nId. 54-79, 90.\n7\nAE A through AE K; AE L (Letter, dated August 16, 2006); AE N through AE U.\n8\n4\nOne of Applicant\u2019s sisters works as a secretary for the Syrian government and\none brother works as an escort to foreign trucks, which travel through Syria from Turkey\nto Jordan. His father worked as an attorney for the Syrian government. His father retired\nfrom his government position and receives a pension from the Syrian government.  His\nmother is a homemaker. His other sister is a homemaker married to a medical doctor.\nTwo brothers are medical doctors, one brother is a music teacher, one brother works as\na laboratory technician in a hospital, and two brothers are in the restaurant business.5\nUnder Syrian law, men are required to serve in the military. In the alternative,\nmen can pay a specific monetary amount not to serve in the military. Applicant\u2019s father\nnever served in the military because he paid the required fee. Four of Applicant\u2019s\nbrothers served in the military for the minimum required service. None of his immediate\nfamily members made the military a career. Under a Syrian presidential law, Applicant\nwas not required to serve in the Syrian military when he visited Syria for a few months.6\nApplicant paid the costs of medical school for two brothers. He talks with his\nparents on the telephone twice a month. When he calls, he may talk with one of his\nsiblings who live with his parents or are visiting. His telephone conversations with his\nsiblings occur one to two times a year on birthdays and holidays. He does not regularly\ntalk with his siblings, especially those who live away from his parents home. His family\ndoes not know where he works or what type of work he does as he does not discuss his\nwork with his family when he visits them.  \n7\nApplicant\u2019s father wants to bring Applicant\u2019s mother and siblings to the United\nStates. Several of Applicant\u2019s brothers have applied for visas to come to the U.S., but\nthe U.S. consulate denied their requests because Applicant lived in the U.S. and the\nconsulate expressed concern that Applicant\u2019s family members would not return to Syria.\nApplicant\u2019s father filed a request to immigrate to the U.S. on behalf of Applicant\u2019s\nmother in 2007 and all his siblings in 2006. The U.S. has not acted on the family\u2019s\nrequest to immigrate to the U.S.8\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, three-brothers-in-law, and three sisters-\nin-law were born in Syria and are citizens of Syria. Except for two sisters-in-law who live\nin Kuwait, his in-laws all live in Syria. His mother-in-law visited in 1999 to be with her\ndaughter when their first child was born. None of his other in-laws have visited the U.S.\nand have not demonstrated an interest in moving to the U.S. Applicant\u2019s wife talks with\nher parents by telephone once a month. She talks with her siblings one or two times a\nyear, when the sibling happens to be at her parents home. For a few months earlier this\nyear, Applicant\u2019s wife communicated with one sister by e-mail on a frequent basis,\n\nTr. 137-146.\n9\nId. 27-40, 158-162.\n10\n5\ndiscussing children and babies. His wife started limiting the frequency of these\ncommunications because she had too much work to do at home raising her children.\nApplicant traveled to Syria in 1997 to marry. He also traveled to Syria in 2000\nand 2001 to visit his family and to introduce his family to his children. He attended the\nwedding of one of his brothers in Syria in 2003 and his sister-in-law\u2019s wedding in 2004.\nEach trip, he remained in Syria three to four weeks, except in 2004 when he remained\nin Syria for three months. Just before this trip, his then employer laid him off. He has not\ntraveled to Syria since 2004. During these trips, he visits with all his family members in\nSyria and with his in-laws.9\nApplicant\u2019s present supervisor and his section head testified on his behalf. Both\nhave or do interact with Applicant at work, but not outside of work. Both recommend him\nfor a security clearance.10\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Syria has an authoritarian\ngovernment. Although the government has not formally stated support for Hezbollah or\nother terrorist groups, the government allows terrorist groups to establish their base of\noperations in Damascus and permits the entry of volunteer militant fighters into Syria. It\nallows Iran and other countries to transport weapons through its countryside to terrorists\ngroups in nearby countries. In 2004, Syria began to scrutinize Arab males entering at\nthe border. Syria treatment of arrested political activists and political detainees does not\nmeet international human rights standards. Evidence regarding Syria\u2019s treatment of\nordinary citizens does not exist. The evidence of record does not show or even hint at\nmistreatment of ordinary citizens. The U.S. and Syria have an uneasy relationship\nbecause of differences in policy over conflicts in the middle east. Currently, direct aid to\nSyria is banned.\nQatar became an independent state in 1971 and is a constitutional monarchy.\nThe Qatar constitution provides its citizens with rights similar to those given to U.S.\ncitizens. Freedom of the press is not the same as in the U.S., with the government\nmaintaining tight controls over the media, but not individual expression of views.\nWomen are allowed to run for elected office. Qatar and the U.S. have a strong and\nexpanding relationship.\nKuwait is an oil-rich constitutional, hereditary emirate ruled by princes. Kuwait\nheld free and fair elections in which women participated in 2006. Kuwait has many\ngovernment sponsored social programs. Since 1991, Kuwait and the U.S. have had a\nstrong relationship. Kuwait is an important partner against international terrorism,\nalthough it is reluctant to confront domestic extremists. Foreign workers comprise ninety\npercent of Kuwait\u2019s labor force.\n\n6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nApplicant has a large family in Syria. He maintains a normal personal relationship\nwith his family members who reside in Syria. His wife also maintains a normal personal\nrelationship with her family in Syria. These relationships are not per se a reason to deny\nApplicant a security clearance. The government must establish that these family\nrelationships create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion or would create a potential conflict of interest between his\nobligations to protect sensitive information and his desire to help his family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the governments of Syria,\nKuwait, and Qatar. See ISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). Applicant\n\nISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-02715 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n11\n8\npaid for two brothers to go to medical school at a time when he had the financial\nresources. He regularly talks with his parents. He talks with his siblings when they are\nvisiting his parents or answer the telephone when he calls. He and his wife visited family\nin Syria four times between 1999 and 2004. During these visits, they saw all his and her\nfamily members, except for family members who were living outside of Syria. His wife\nmaintains regular contact with her family members. The contacts with family outside\nSyria are generally more limited. The governments of Qatar and Kuwait do not support\nterrorism and the active collection of intelligence or proprietary information. I do not find\na heightened concern exists as to Applicant\u2019s family members in Qatar and Kuwait.\nHowever, given the frequency of Applicant and his wife\u2019s contacts with their\nfamily members in Syria and Syria\u2019s strong support of terrorist activities, the government\nhas established the existence of a heightened risk that the government of Syria could\nplace pressure on Applicant to provide classified information by threatening harm to his\nfamily members. AG \u00b6 7 (a), (b), and (d) apply.11\nIn deciding if Applicant has submitted evidence of mitigation, under AG \u00b6 8 (a), I\nmust consider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider if\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests\nApplicant\u2019s maintains a normal relationship with his family members. While this\nrelationship is not a basis to deny him a security clearance, his burden of proof on\nmitigation requires more than statements about the limited scope of his conversations\nwith family members and family members lack of knowledge about his employment.\nTwo of his family members work for the Syrian government, a factor which works\nagainst mitigation. His father receives a pension from the Syrian government, another\nfactor which supports a finding against mitigation.  Because the Syrian government\nprovides financial resources to these individuals, it raises the possibly that the Syrian\ngovernment could pressure them for classified information from Applicant, should it\nlearn about Applicant\u2019s work.\n\n9\nFinally, \u00b6 8 (c) permits mitigation if the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk\nfor foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s twice a month contacts with his parents\nare not casual and infrequent. In contrast, his once or twice a year contacts with his\nsiblings qualify  as casual and infrequent. His very short and brief telephone calls with\nhis in-laws are casual, but may not be infrequent. His wife\u2019s contacts with her parents\nand at least one sister are not casual and infrequent.  He does visit with all family\nmembers who live in Syria when he travels to Syria. Overall, his contacts and his wife\u2019s\ncontacts with family members do not allow for mitigation. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. After arriving in the U.S. in 1984.\nApplicant chose to remain in this country. Applicant became a U.S. citizen nearly 19\nyears ago. During his more than 23 years as a U.S. resident and citizen, he has\ncomplied with its laws and lived a quiet and unassuming life. His children are U.S. born\nand raised. His wife is now a U.S. citizen. He clearly has established strong connections\nto the U.S. His work recommends him for a clearance, an indication of their trust in him.\nHis family in Syria, however, remains a serious concern, particularly since Syria\nstrongly supports the terrorist activities in the middle east. Syria and the U.S. have a\nstrained relationship because of their differing policies towards terrorist. Three of\nApplicant\u2019s family members rely on the Syrian government for income, a fact which the\nSyrian government could use to coerce them into forcing Applicant to reveal classified\ninformation. Applicant\u2019s father applied for immigrant status for all his children in 2006\nand his wife in 2007. The U.S.  government has not yet approved the family\u2019s request to\nimmigrate.  As long as Applicant\u2019s family remains in Syria, a concern exists about the\n\n10\nability of the Syrian government to coerce, pressure or exploit Applicant. His contacts\nwith his family reflect a close personal relationship with his family in Syria, which is\nsufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline B. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 13, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable finding as to SOR \u00b6 1(e) is not at issue on appeal.\n1\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 19, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.\nMatchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, which indicated that Applicant\u2019s\ninability to satisfy his outstanding federal tax debt was due to circumstances beyond his control.  He\nalso contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact give a distorted picture of his financial situation.\nApplicant has not demonstrated the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n(1) The Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported\nby substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  Moreover, there is a presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence unless she states\notherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).  The Judge is not\nrequired to discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at\n2 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences\nthat could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change\nthe outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings\nof security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n(2) The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\n\nApplicant\u2019s house was foreclosed on in August 2007, and he owed the mortgage company over $11,000.  He\n2\nhad not made any payments on that debt and stated that he intended to file for bankruptcy to discharge it after he had paid\nother delinquent debts.  Decision at 3.\n3\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had a significant amount\nof outstanding federal tax debt, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.   In light of the\n2\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to one of the SOR\nallegations.   However, she reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo. The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Elizabeth Stachura, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 17, 2006. On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nDecember 19, 2008\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 25, 2008, and he requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA administrative judge. On September 23, 2008, the case was assigned\nto me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for him. On October 3, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nNovember 6, 2008.\nOn October 8, 2008, counsel for Applicant entered her appearance and she\nrequested a continuance. Department Counsel objected on the basis that Applicant had\nbeen notified of the planned hearing date of November 6, 2008, as early as September\n22, 2008, and he had been advised to diligently retain an attorney if it was his intention\nto do so. During a conference call with the parties on October 10, 2008, it was\ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s counsel had no schedule conflicts for November 6, 2008. In\nthe absence of good cause shown for a delay and after consideration of scheduling\nissues, I denied the request for continuance.\nThe parties appeared at the hearing as scheduled on November 6, 2008. Seven\ngovernment exhibits (Ex. 1-7) and 12 Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-L) were admitted without\nany objections. Applicant and his spouse testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on November 14, 2008. Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\nhearing testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F (financial considerations) that Applicant owes\ndelinquent federal taxes of $11,267 for 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $7,498 for 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b),\n$19,528 for 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $2,403 for 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and state taxes of\n$8,900 for tax years 2000 through 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant admitted the allegations\nwithout explanation. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior field engineer who has been employed by the\nsame defense contractor since October 1986 (Ex. 1, Tr. 46). He has held a security\nclearance since he served in the United States Navy from October 1976 to October\n1986 (Ex. 1, Tr. 48, 87).\nApplicant and his spouse married in August 1978 (Ex. 1, Tr. 48), and they had\ntwo children (Tr. 48). In October 1986, he was discharged from the Navy for medical\nreasons when his son was about seven and his daughter five (Tr. 48-49, 182, 200). He\nbegan working for his present employer that same month, which meant a relocation for\nhimself and his family (Tr. 50, 182). His spouse began working part-time during the\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nschool day for a retailer (Tr. 183). In May or June 1987, Applicant\u2019s employer lost the\ncontract he was working on. Faced with unemployment or finding another job in the\ncompany, Applicant took a position with his employer at the same pay but in another\nstate, so he and his family moved again (Tr. 51, 183).\nApplicant and his spouse purchased a home in their new locale. She was\nunemployed initially, but subsequently worked about 14 hours per week in accounts\npayable in a company\u2019s insurance department (Tr. 184). In late 1988 or early 1989,\nApplicant again faced the prospect of unemployment as his employer lost the contract\nfor his program. Unable to find other suitable employment in the area after a brief\nsearch, Applicant stayed with his employer but had to move his family yet again (Tr.\n184). On assurances from their real estate agent that their home could sell anytime,\nApplicant and his spouse made no effort to find tenants. The house remained on the\nmarket for about a year before it sold in late 1989 at a loss of several thousand dollars\n(Tr. 52-55, 185). \nIn their new locale, Applicant and his spouse found a home they wanted to buy.\nThinking their former residence would sell quickly, they made a deal with the builder to\nrent it until they were able to close on their other home (Tr. 56). Even with his spouse\nworking in data entry part-time for a municipal community services board (Tr. 186), their\nincome was insufficient to cover their financial obligations, which included their rent and\nthe mortgage on their prior residence. Applicant and his spouse incurred substantial\ndebt as they relied on credit cards and loans (Ex. 3, Tr. 54-55) to cover travel expenses\nassociated with the showing of their house (Tr. 185). After it sold, they bought the house\nthey were renting (Tr. 56), taking out a VA 30-year mortgage of $121,500 in January\n1990. They made their mortgage payments on time (Ex. 5).\nFollowing a government consolidation of his military customer in the mid-1990s,\nApplicant was yet again faced with the prospect of looking for a new job or of relocating\nto stay with his employer. He was unsuccessful in finding \u201cequitable\u201d employment where\nhe was living, and he moved in October 1994 with their son to keep his job with the\ndefense contractor (Tr. 57-58, 187). Applicant\u2019s spouse and daughter joined them in\nJanuary 1995 (Tr. 187). Applicant\u2019s spouse got a job with a home improvement retailer\nin their new locale, and she progressed through the ranks to become a store manager\nby 2003 (Tr. 65, 190-91). Applicant and his spouse rented out their home in their\nprevious locale until it sold in about September 1996 (Ex. 5). The rent covered only a\nportion of the mortgage (Tr. 188-89). They were unable to qualify for a mortgage in their\npresent locale (Tr. 59), so they have been renters since 1995.\nFor several years starting with tax year 1997, Applicant failed to adjust his tax\nwithholdings to account for the impact of the loss of the home mortgage deduction.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nWhen he filed his and his spouse\u2019s joint income tax return for tax year 1997, they\nunderpaid their federal taxes on taxable income of $58,279. After credit for $6,616 in\ntaxes withheld, but with penalties and interest added, they owed the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) about $4,601.49 as of May 1998 (Ex. B). They could not afford to pay the\ndebt, as they were still paying on credit card obligations incurred for living expenses in\nthe past (Tr. 60-61). Applicant arranged with the IRS to repay the debt. After the IRS\ncredited them $106.47, Applicant paid $150 in July 1998, $326 in August 1998, and\n$350 each in October and November 1998. Applicant did not provide evidence of\nsubsequent payments for the tax debt, but IRS records show their tax obligation for tax\nyear 1997 was satisfied as of December 2001 (Ex. B).\nFor tax year 1998, Applicant and his spouse filed separately. He prepared the\nreturns himself using tax software. Based on the calculations, he thought they would be\nbetter off filing separately (Tr. 64). His portion of their taxable income was $43,819.\nAfter his return was filed and assessed, he owed $4,686.67 for tax year 1998 as of May\n1999 (Ex. B). His spouse owed as well, and he wasn\u2019t able to pay her tax debt (Tr. 63).\nApplicant made one payment of $326 toward his debt in August 1999, and subsequent\npayments starting in June 2000. As of June 2003, he had satisfied his federal tax debt\nfor 1998 (Ex. B, Tr. 61).\nApplicant and his spouse resumed filing joint returns starting with tax year 1999.\nOn taxable income of $78,742 for 1999, they owed taxes of $16,358 but had only\n$8,826 in taxes withheld. For tax year 2000, Applicant and his spouse earned joint\ntaxable income of $99,129. They had $15,926.77 withheld on a federal tax debt of\n$22,055 (Ex. B). They did not have the funds to cover these tax debts because they\nwere making payments on about $25,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt (Tr. 90)\nincurred in part for living expenses (food, gasoline, heating oil, Tr. 105) and unexpected\nexpenses since early 1989 (Tr. 106). In 2001, Applicant and his spouse consulted with a\ncredit counseling service to consolidate their substantial credit card debt (Ex. 3).\nStarting in August 2001, they began making monthly payments of about $545 per month\nto the credit counseling service (Ex. F, Tr. 90-97). Applicant opened and charged on\nseveral low limit credit card accounts after 2001 that he subsequently added into the\ndebt consolidation or paid outside of the plan (Tr. 98-100). A delinquent telephone debt\nof $1,065 was paid after charge off in or about August 2004 (Ex. 5, Ex. 7).\n \nMeanwhile, his tax debt continued to grow. For tax year 2001, they owed at least\n$663 (Ex. C). On joint taxable income of $99,820 for 2002, they had only $11,672.49\nwithheld on taxes owed of $20,749 (Ex. B). On October 18, 2002, the IRS issued a\nnotice of levy to collect back taxes of about $7,342.25 for tax year 1999. (Ex. B).\n\nApplicant testified he and the IRS (and starting in February 2007, the state) agreed to the amounts\n1\ntaken from his pay (Tr. 73-74). The leave and earnings statements list the payments as a garnishment (Ex.\nG).\nApplicant testified that he started working with the tax resolution firm in October 2004 and that the\n2\nIRS garnished almost his entire paycheck in March 2005 (Tr. 71, 125-26).The available evidence suggests\nbut does not confirm, however, that his contacts with the tax resolution may have been as early as October\n2002, in response to the IRS levy for tax year 1999. A  \u201cmiscellaneous payment\u201d of $1,092.50 was made\ntoward his tax debt on March 24, 2003, and regular payments of $242.31 were made to the IRS starting May\n17, 2004 (Ex. B). \nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nIn spring 2003, Applicant\u2019s spouse began collecting temporary disability for about\neight or nine months. Her benefit was less than what her pay would have been (Tr. 66-\n67), but their joint taxable income for that year still totaled $87,056. Available\ninformation shows a miscellaneous payment of $1,092 toward his federal tax debt in\nMarch 2003 but nothing thereafter until mid-May 2004 (see Ex. B).\n In or before October 2004, Applicant paid $1,200 up-front and then $100 per\nmonth thereafter (Tr. 127) to a tax resolution firm that promised to work with the IRS to\nmitigate penalties and interest (Tr. 70). Applicant continued to receive notices from the\nIRS but did not respond on assurances from the tax resolution firm that it was working\non his case (Tr. 71). After the IRS took most of one paycheck, he realized that the tax\nresolution company was giving him the \u201crunaround\u201d (Tr. 72). Applicant stopped his\nmonthly payments to the company and he contacted the IRS directly. The IRS agreed\nthat about $243 would be taken out of his pay every two weeks (Ex. B, Ex. G, Tr. 74).1\nThese payments, which continued to February 2007, were applied to the tax\ndelinquencies for tax year 1999 and, after that debt was satisfied, to tax year 2000 (Ex.\n3, Ex. B, Ex. G, Tr. 62, 74).  \n2\n \nOn May 31, 2004, the IRS processed Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s joint return for\n2003. A tax debt of $14,239 was assessed but they had only $9,648.72 in withholdings.\nOn August 27, 2004, the IRS filed a tax lien in the amount of $28,224 (Ex. E). When\nApplicant prepared their joint income tax return for tax year 2004, he learned that their\ntax liability had \u201cspiked\u201d for that year (Tr. 123). His spouse had returned to work in\nJanuary 2004  but at a lower position of assistant manager (Tr. 151). She resigned in\nFebruary 2004 as she \u201cdidn\u2019t have the heart for it anymore\u201d (Tr. 152). Denied\nunemployment and behind on household bills, including a couple of months late in their\nrent (Tr. 119), Applicant\u2019s spouse did not rollover her 401(k) into a new account.\nInstead, they used some of the money to pay their household obligations (Tr. 67-68).\nBecause of the penalties associated with early withdrawal from the 401(k), Applicant\nand his spouse owed at least $11,019.41 in delinquent taxes for 2004 (Ex. 4). He had\n\nApplicant testified he knew that early withdrawal would increase their taxes, but he was unaware of\n3\nadditional penalties (Tr. 120).\nApplicant tried unsuccessfully to obtain records from the state confirming his payments (Tr. 140).\n4\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nan accountant look over his return for any errors, because he could not believe what\nthey owed (Tr. 68, 123).3\nApplicant\u2019s spouse got a job working as an operations manager for an electronics\nretailer in 2004. She earned about half their household income. In December 2004, they\nincurred unexpected expenses totaling about $5,000 to pay for her mother\u2019s funeral and\nrelated travel costs (Tr. 196, 202). The stress of a long commute and 60-70 hour work\nweeks took its toll on Applicant\u2019s spouse by 2006. She planned to resign, but her\nemployer offered her a position closer to home with a 40-hour work week but at less\nincome (Tr. 130-33, 194). In 2005, Applicant adjusted his filing status to married\nclaiming zero dependents so that additional taxes would be withheld from his pay (Tr.\n84), although they ended up owing $2,403.10 for that year (Ex. 4).\nIn early 2007, the state sought garnishment action to collect the back state taxes,\neven though Applicant claims he was making \u201cfairly consistent\u201d payments toward the\n$8,900 state tax debt (Tr. 74, 142).  In January 2007, he was interviewed for his\n4\nclearance about the federal tax lien and other financial issues. He indicated he was\npaying the IRS $500 a month, and that he considered his financial situation favorable\n(Ex. 3).\nEffective with the pay period beginning February 10, 2007, his employer stopped\npaying the IRS out of Applicant\u2019s wages and the state began to attach his wages (Tr.\n144). After a payment of $120.98, the state has taken $126 from his pay twice monthly\n(Ex.  G). Applicant did not notice that the IRS payment had stopped for a couple of\nmonths because he was adjusting his W-2 status (Ex. 2, Tr. 75). On May 21, 2007, the\nIRS requested repayment from Applicant of $2,403.10 for tax year 2005, and from his\nspouse of $7,498.82 for tax year 2003 (Ex. 4). On September 3, 2007, the IRS issued a\nnotice of levy for the 2003 taxes (Ex. B). Applicant contacted the IRS and he agreed to\npay his back taxes at $600 per month. He apparently made the full payment in\nDecember 2007, but only a partial payment of $400 or $450 in January 2008 (Tr. 76).\nApplicant did not make any subsequent payments to the IRS, in part because of the\nhigh cost of home heating oil in February/March 2008 (Tr. 171).\nAfter preparing their joint tax return for 2007, Applicant realized that they had\noverpaid their taxes by $1,978. He testified that a refund for 2006 had been intercepted\nby the IRS and he fully expected his refund for 2007 to be taken as well. He assumed\n\nThe breakdown on the tax debt is $10,258.14 for 2002, $8,706.04 for 2003, $20,159.99 for 2004, and\n5\n$2,830.99 for 2005 (Ex. C).\nThe IRS acknowledged receipt of the proposed installment agreement in relation to tax year 2005\n6\n(Ex. A). The amount of Applicant\u2019s back tax obligation was not made part of the record for review. He testified\nhe owed less than in previous years (Tr. 84). He overpaid his federal taxes for 2006 but only by about $90 (Tr.\n85) and by a much larger amount, almost $2,000 (Tr. 85), in 2007. His expected refunds were apparently\nintercepted by the IRS (Tr. 76).\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nthis compensated for their obligation to make the monthly $600 payment to the IRS (Tr.\n77-78, 150). IRS records confirm his refund for 2007 was taken by the IRS on or before\nMay 12, 2008, and applied to tax year 2002 (Ex. 4). Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s\neconomic stimulus tax rebate of $1,200 was intercepted by the IRS on or about June\n23, 2008, and applied toward their obligation for 2002, leaving them with a remaining\nbalance of $10,248.55 for 2002 (Ex. C).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse resigned from her job in June 2008 (Tr. 152). Her employer\nwent to a computer-generated time schedule under which she no longer could rely on\nregular hours. She appealed a denial of unemployment compensation, and has been\nlooking for a job in an office environment (Tr. 130-33, 152, 197).\nBy IRS notice dated March 10, 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse was informed she owed\n$19,528.02 in delinquent federal income taxes for tax year 2004 (Ex. 4). Applicant\nasked the IRS to roll her tax delinquency into the existing installment agreement. He\nwas advised that they would have to submit another agreement (Tr. 77-78). As of July\n2008, the IRS records indicated Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s outstanding delinquent tax\ndebt for tax years 2002 through 2005 totaled $41,955.16 (Ex. C).5\nOn September 25, 2008, Applicant and his spouse proposed to pay the IRS $300\nper month.  In acknowledging receipt of his proposal, the IRS notified Applicant on\n6\nOctober 29, 2008, that he should continue to make the payments under existing\ninstallment agreements pending IRS review of his proposal (Ex. A).\nAs of October 13, 2008, the IRS reported outstanding tax balances of $10,461 for\n2002 and $9,003.15 for 2003 (Ex. B), due to interest continuing to accrue (Tr. 153). As\nof late September 2008, they had about $6,717.73 in credit card debt that remained to\nbe resolved in the debt consolidation plan. About $45,191 had been disbursed to their\ncreditors under the plan as of October 2008 (Ex. F, Ex. H). Applicant and his spouse\nintend to continue to make their monthly payments until the debt is paid off in about\nAugust or September 2009 (Ex. H. Tr. 85). Once that debt is paid, they plan to increase\nthe amount of their monthly payment to the IRS (Tr. 85). Applicant\u2019s wages continue to\nbe attached in the amount of $126 twice a month in repayment of their state taxes. He\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nanticipates that his delinquent state taxes will be satisfied in two or three years,\nprovided he is able to keep his job (Tr. 89). Applicant owes state taxes for 2006, but not\nfor 2007 (Tr. 136).\nApplicant and his spouse rent a two-bedroom house of about 1,200 square feet.\nAs of early November 2008, they were one month behind in their rent, which is $1,000\nper month (Tr. 171-72). They own only one car. Applicant has been taking the bus to\nwork for the past couple years (Tr. 86-87, 155). The car was paid off in about\nSeptember 2008 (Ex. D, Tr. 172-73). He realizes they are not in a position to take on\nanother car payment (Tr. 87). They have been operating under a budget for the past\nfour years. Before that, they tried to pay the bills as they came in (Tr. 138), but Applicant\noccasionally forgot to pay some of them. Most of their household bills are now paid\nelectronically (Tr. 139). He has set aside $300 to make a payment to the IRS in\nNovember 2008 (Tr. 156). They pay $130 per month for cable television and Internet\nservice (Tr. 173). He has $18.93 deducted from his pay every two weeks for gym\nmemberships for himself and his spouse (Ex. G, Tr. 160). They went to the gym a\ncouple times per week until six months ago when his spouse injured her shoulder (Tr.\n160). Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law gave him $6,000 to pay for legal representation at his\nsecurity clearance hearing. She has not asked to be repaid, although Applicant and his\nspouse intend to repay her (Tr. 201).\nApplicant is active in his church, having taught Sunday School for the past year,\nand in his local community, where he coaches softball and is on the board of directors\nfor a softball league In both situations, he has shown himself to be conscientious and\nhonest (Ex. I, Ex. J, Tr. 80-82). \nApplicant\u2019s employer is aware of his credit issues. His current supervisor recently\ntook over the department. He has had limited contact with Applicant since but indicates\nthat Applicant has been reissued a company credit card which he is monitoring closely.\nBased on his observations, he supports continuation of Applicant\u2019s clearance (Ex. L). A\ncoworker who has observed Applicant\u2019s work on a daily basis has found him to be\ntrustworthy, reliable, and to possess good judgment. Applicant, who handles classified\ninformation on a daily basis, has given him no reason to believe he would mishandle\nsensitive information (Ex. K).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n10\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant and his spouse underpaid their federal and state income taxes every\nyear starting with tax year 1997 through 2005. Their federal tax debt totaled more than\n$50,000, excluding interest and penalties. Although no state tax records were provided\nfor review, Applicant admitted that he and his spouse owed about $8,900 in delinquent\nstate income taxes for tax years 2000 through 2005. Applicant made payments to\nsatisfy his delinquent taxes for 1997 and 1998. His wages were garnished by the IRS in\nthe amount of $1,092.50 in March 2003 for his 1999 taxes, and at $243.31 every other\nweek from May 2004 to February 2007. These payments, as well as expected tax\nrefunds from 2006, 2007, and the economic stimulus refund, were intercepted and\napplied to their delinquent federal income taxes but they still owed $41,955.16 as of July\n2008. The state began garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages in late February 2007, at $126\nevery other week as of May 2007. Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply. Applicant adjusted his tax\nwithholdings so that they were entitled to federal tax refunds for 2006 and 2007, and to\na state tax refund for 2007. Yet, it took him a couple of months to notice that his\nemployer had stopped the IRS garnishment in February 2007. He made no payment\nuntil after the IRS issued a notice of levy in September 2007. While Applicant contacted\nthe IRS and agreed to $600 monthly payments, he made only one full payment in\nDecember 2007. He paid the IRS only $400 or $450 in January 2008 and nothing\nthereafter while interest continued to accrue on his and his spouse\u2019s delinquent tax\ndebts. The delay in resolving their federal and state income tax debts is due at least in\n\nApplicant testified that once he realized the tax firm had done nothing on his behalf, he \u201cimmediately\u201d\n7\ncalled the IRS. It is unclear when he contacted the IRS, who expressed to him that they understood what he\nwas saying but that they could not let him \u201cignore\u201d them for that long (Tr. 72-73).\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n11\npart to the fact that they have paid a tax resolution firm $545 to $568 per month since\nAugust 2001. As of late September 2008, $45,216 had been disbursed to their creditors.\nThis extensive credit card debt was not alleged in the SOR, but it is relevant in\nassessing whether he has handled his finances appropriately, and whether his current\nfinancial situation presents an unacceptable security risk. There is merit to the\ngovernment\u2019s concern that Applicant has given resolution of his consumer credit\ndelinquencies priority over his tax obligations.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies in limited part. During 1989,\nApplicant and his spouse paid both the mortgage on their house in their prior locale,\nand rent at their new location. They also had travel costs associated with the attempts\nto sell their home. They relied on credit to pay for living expenses, even after they were\nsettled in their new location, and this had an impact on their taxes years later as they\ncould not afford to pay their back taxes and the monthly payment under a debt\nconsolidation plan. Applicant also relied in good faith to his detriment on the assurances\nof a tax resolution firm that it was working on his behalf, but he should not have ignored\nIRS notices.  He also made a poor financial decision in failing to research the tax\n7\nimplications of his spouse cashing out her 401(k) in 2004. \nApplicant submits he arranged with the IRS to have $243.31 taken from his\nwages every two weeks (see AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), although his earnings statement\nlists the deduction as a garnishment. This continued until mid-February 2007, when\nunknown to Applicant at the time, the state began garnishing his wages to collect\ndelinquent state taxes. However, I am unable to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(d) or AG \u00b6 20(c)\n(\u201cthe person has received counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d). In May 2007, the IRS notified\nApplicant and his spouse of their respective tax delinquencies for 2005 and 2003. There\nis no evidence that Applicant or his spouse made any payments that summer to the\nIRS. It was not until after the IRS issued a notice of levy in September 2007 that\nApplicant contacted the IRS and agreed to make $600 payments. He made one full\npayment in December 2007, a partial payment in January 2008, and nothing thereafter.\nHe attributes his failure to make any payments of late to high heating costs, to his\nmistaken assumption that his $1,978 tax refund for 2007 would cover for the payments,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n12\nand to his spouse\u2019s unemployment since June 2008. Interception of his tax refund\nwould cover three months, and of their economic stimulus payment another two months.\nIn late September 2008, Applicant and his spouse proposed that they repay their federal\ntax debt at $300 per month. As of his pay period ending October 3, 2008 (Ex. G),\nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay  for the year was $31,370.98 on gross earnings of\n$58,647.82. They no longer had a car payment of $315 per month, having paid off their\ncar the previous month. Yet, they were one month behind in their rent as of November\n2008, and they had to rely on his spouse\u2019s sister for the funds to retain legal counsel for\nthe hearing on his security clearance suitability.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant has always complied with his obligations to file income tax returns. Yet\nhe has a chronic record of underpayment of income taxes, both federal and state, that\ncannot be attributed to changes in work location or other factors outside of his control.\nDespite joint taxable income of almost $100,000 in both 2000 and 2002, Applicant\u2019s and\nhis spouse\u2019s delinquent federal taxes for 2000 were not satisfied until 2005, and their\nback taxes for 2002 through 2005 are still unpaid. The ongoing repayment of their state\ntax debt at $126 every two weeks since February 2007 justifies a favorable finding as to\nSOR \u00b6 1.e, but the efforts to deal with their outstanding federal tax delinquency have\nbeen inconsistent. Considerable concerns persist about Applicant\u2019s financial judgment\nand ability to repay their substantial federal tax debt in the foreseeable future. They are\none month behind in their rent, yet continue to pay $36 per month for a fitness club that\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n13\nthey haven\u2019t used for six months, and $130 per month for cable and Internet services.\nHis work record, including his appropriate handling of classified information is in his\nfavor, but it is not enough to overcome the financial concerns in this case.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the amended SOR, as required by\nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and\nanswered the SOR allegations in writing. On January 8, 2008, she was sent a letter\nstating that her response was incomplete, requesting her to state whether she wished\nto have a hearing on the matter. A January 22, 2008, response to the SOR was\nsubmitted admitting the allegations with explanations and indicating Applicant\u2019s\nselection of a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received that request on\nJune 30, 2008\n\n Tr. 30.\n1\n Applicant remains unclear as to whether she was the only defendant afforded a court appointed attorney.\n2\n Tr. 39.\n3\n See., e.g., Tr. 50.\n4\n2\nMarch 3, 2008, and the matter was assigned to me on March 5, 2008. Department\nCounsel and Applicant agreed to an April 1, 2008, hearing date and a Notice of Hearing\nwas issued on March 17, 2008. Due to an administrative conflict, an Amended Notice of\nHearing was issued on March 27, 2008, moving the hearing to April 3, 2008.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted five\nexhibits (Ex.). which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-5 without objection.\nApplicant submitted two exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-B without objection. No witnesses\nwere called. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 10, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year-old mail room worker who works for a defense contractor.\nShe has a high school diploma and briefly attended college. She has one child, an\neight-year-old daughter.\nIn the third grade, Applicant had been held back a year. Consequently, she\nturned 18 while in high school, where most of her peers were minors. 1998 was a\ndifficult year for her. Her parents had separated and her father had passed away. On\nMarch 21, 1998, Applicant and five or six of her girl friends from school went to a local\nmall. One of her peers said \u201cHey. Let\u2019s, you know, get a pair of jeans out of the store,\nyou know. I don\u2019t think you can get in trouble . . . if you just get a pair \u2013 \u2013 a shirt or\nsomething . . . .\u201d  With that childish challenge waged, the girls entered a department\n1\nstore to execute the plan. Applicant chose to take a shirt, which she put on to wear.\nBefore they left the store, the students were escorted to security by a female security\nguard. There, a male security guard joined the party to inventory the clothing the\nstudents had attempted to steal. All the clothing involved totaled approximately $752 in\nmerchandise. The young ladies were cuffed and taken by van to a local police station.\nAt the station, charges were waged and Applicant was released to her mother.\nAbout a month later, Applicant appeared in court. Each of the students was\naccompanied by a parent, although Applicant was also accompanied by a court\nappointed attorney.  Both the judge and the attorney explained the situation to all the\n2\ndefendants at the same time, but Applicant was very nervous and recalls very little of\nthe event.  She remembers discussion about expungement.  She does not remember\n3\n4\nanyone ever using the term \u201cfelony\u201d to describe the charge to which the students would\n\n Tr. 39-40.\n5\n Applicant\u2019s police record shows that she was found guilty of grand larceny (stealing clothing valued at $200\n6\nor more), sentenced to two years in jail (suspended), and ordered to pay costs of approximately $750. See\nEx. 4.\n Tr. 40-41, 46.\n7\n Tr. 42.\n8\n Tr. 41-42.\n9\n Tr. 40-41.\n10\n Tr. 47.\n11\n Tr. 48.\n12\n Tr. 47-48.\n13\n Tr. 45-46.\n14\n3\nplea guilty.  She remembers entering a guilty plea.  She did not think the charge or the\n5\n6\nconviction was a felony, only a charge that would be ultimately removed from her adult\nrecord.  A formal two year sentence in jail was suspended, so she was relieved of\n7\nserving jail time. She expressed her contrition and restitution was made. She resolved it\nwould be her only brush with the law and determined to move on with her life as a\n\u201cpositive, productive person.\u201d  She did not dwell on the event.\n8\n9\nIndeed, later, in successfully applying for positions of trust both as a bank teller\nand as an employee of a federal agency, Applicant made no reference to the criminal\ncharge. The incident did not prove to be an issue or an obstacle in either job.\nConsequently, her belief that the expungement made the entire incident a nullity not\nworthy of reporting seemed confirmed and she kept the incident out of her mind.  \n10\nWhen Applicant first applied for her present position, she was orally asked about\ncriminal activity in the past seven years. Although she thought the issue was otherwise\ninapplicable because of the expungement, she denied such criminal activity. She did so\nbecause seven years had passed and because she believed the incident, having been\nexpunged, was a non-issue.  When she subsequently completed her SF-86, she did so\n11\nunaided.  She also noticed an emphasis on inquiries as to incidents in the past seven\n12\nyears, the same time frame mentioned when she first applied for the job.  Based on\n13\nher understanding of the incident, her situation, and past experience in what was\nneeded for preemployment screening, she answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 23(a)'s inquiry as\nto whether she had previously been charged or convicted of a felony. In so doing, she\nwas not deliberately withholding information, only answering the question as she\nthought appropriate given the nature of the incident and the expungement.  In a\n14\nsubsequent oral interview, she described the incident. Eventually, she rephrased her\nanswer to the question to disclose the arrest, the conviction, and the circumstances.\n\n Tr. 54.\n15\n Ex. A (Co-W orker letter I).\n16\n Ex. B (Co-W orker letter II).\n17\n Ex. C (Manager letter).\n18\n4\nIn the intervening years between the arrest and her current security clearance\napplication, Applicant became committed to her resolve to move beyond the arrest. She\ndescribes herself as \u201ca changed person.\u201d  She stresses her personal growth and\n15\nmaturity since her arrest. She completed high school. She had a baby. She is active\nwith her church. She found a college schedule and collegiate life incompatible with her\nadult responsibilities as a mother and wage-earner. Instead, she chose to balance her\nadult obligations maturely and successfully. One co-worker describes her as \u201chonest,\ncaring of what\u2019s right, and works hard, showing a high degree of professionalism in\nevery endeavor she embarks upon.\u201d The co-worker continues by stating: \u201cShe is a quick\nstudy and very loyal. [She] is an asset to any organization. . . .\u201d  Another co-worker\n16\ndescribes Applicant as \u201cdependable and a joy to work with.\u201d  Her manager describes\n17\nher as \u201cloyal, honest, and a very hard worker. I highly recommend her for a position of\ntrust.\u201d18\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n19\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n20\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n20\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n21\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n22\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n23\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n24\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case: Guideline\nJ \u2013 Criminal Conduct and Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct. Conditions pertaining to\nthese adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the appropriate sections below.\n\n6\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \nThe concern regarding criminal conduct is that criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  Applicant was arrested, charged with a felony, and convicted in 1998 for\nthe theft of clothing along with some high school peers. Consequently, as urged by the\nGovernment, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses) applies. With a disqualifying condition thus\nraised, it is Applicant\u2019s burden to raise conditions in mitigation.\nIn 1998, Applicant had a difficult home life. Her parents\u2019 marriage failed, they\nseparated, then her father passed away. Having been held back a grade in elementary\nschool, she was slightly older than her academic peers. When some of her high school\ngirlfriends dared each other to steal a piece of clothing, Applicant succumbed to the\npeer pressure and joined in. Their senior year prank, however, was not a joke to the\nstore or the police. Together, they were caught, tried, and convicted. \nOver a decade later, Applicant is no longer an easily influenced school girl. She\nis a grown, mature, woman who, at an early age, made the difficult choice to become\nan independent, single, working mother. She purposefully pursued a course of\nemployment that permitted her to balance her financial needs with her maternal\nobligations. As a result, she has earned the respect and trust of her manager and co-\nworkers while balancing her family life with church and social activities. There is no\nevidence to suggest even the remotest possibility she would ever again succumb to\nimmature pressures or resort to childish antics. There is no reason to gauge the woman\nshe is today in 2008 on a youthful transgression from over a decade ago.\nConsequently, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and \u00b6 32(b) (the person was\npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present\nin the person\u2019s life) apply. \nAdditionally, aside from the passage of a decade and a great deal of maturation,\nApplicant expressed her contrition and made restitution on the clothing article. She has\nnever again had a brush with the law. Indeed, she immediately began her own personal\nrehabilitation when she purposefully resolved to never again find herself in such trouble.\nAs a result, she has led a life of successful achievement, devoid of  criminal conduct.\nShe has been a responsible mother and employee, and been active within her\ncommunity church. Such factors additionally give rise to CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal conduct, remorse or restitution, job training or high\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement).\n\n7\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns related to personal conduct arise because personal conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or\nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. Here, Applicant\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to an SF-86 question inquiring to whether she had ever been charged or\nconvicted of a felony. As urged by the Government, such facts could potentially give\nrise to Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) and \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security officer, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative).\nApplicant was a high school student when she was charged with the theft of\nclothing along with her peers. It was a traumatic experience for her, as she appeared in\ncourt with her mother. As a result, she remembers little of the incident. What she does\nremember, however, is that all the female students appeared as a group before the\njudge, that she did not have to serve time in jail, and that an explanation was given as\nto how expungement worked. In short, only the payment of costs necessitated action,\neverything else seemed waived. After becoming a mother and entering the workplace,\nshe sought and obtained employment as a bank teller and with a federal agency.\nKnowing she was subject to some sort of screening for such positions, but also knowing\n\u2013 or thinking \u2013 her arrest and conviction had been expunged, she did not mention the\nincidents when she applied for those jobs. No further inquiries were ever made. As a\nresult, her interpretation of what transpired in 1998 was confirmed: her record had been\nexpunged and the incident was a non-issue. Similarly, when she denied a past charge\nor conviction for a felony on her SF-86, Applicant did not actively attempt to conceal or\nfalsify. Rather, thinking the matter had been erased by the courts and was now a nullity.\nThe Government also points to Applicant\u2019s inconsistency in explaining why she\ndid not note the 1998 incident on her SF-86: Was it because she forgot about the\nincident? Was it because she thought it was expunged? Was it because she thought it\nwas not necessary to report the matter? It argues her inconsistency highlights itself as\nrecent misconduct involving active concealment and demands scrutiny of her credibility.\nThis apparent inconsistency, however, is not irreconcilable. Applicant explained that\nshe had purposefully put the incident out of her mind in her attempt to move on with her\nlife. She did so after concluding that her record would be expunged and the incident\nreduced to a nullity. Her decision to do this seemed solid after gaining banking and\ngovernment jobs, both of which included some form of pre-employment screening. On\nthe stand, Applicant\u2019s testimony was exceptionally credible. Given that credibility, in\nconjunction with her level of education, her youth at the time, and her experience in\n\n8\nsubsequent years, her conclusion is highly plausible and gives no indication that her\npast inconsistencies were the result of misconduct, rather than basic misunderstanding.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is an articulate and credible young woman. Her youthful\nbrush with the law inspired her to refocus her life and her belief that the incident was\nexpunged from her record gave her the feeling she could start anew. She is no longer\nthe high schooler who takes up risky challenges for the sake of a thrill or to join the\ncrowd. She is a respected employee and responsible single mother who demonstrates\nno qualities that might suggest she would ever again find herself on the wrong side of\nthe law. \nWhen Applicant was adjudicated along with her younger peers, expungement\nwas duly explained to the group. Therefore, she was left with the impression her record\nwould be wiped clean and that the incident would be deemed a nullity. Consequently, it\nwas a learning experience best put behind her and safely forgotten. When she\neventually obtained employment with the federal government and as a bank teller, the\nincident she believed to be expunged was not disclosed, the issue did not arise, and\nher belief her record had been wiped clean validated. Consequently, she confirmed her\nunderstanding that her record had been expunged. Not illogically, she subsequently\nanswered \u201cno\u201d on the SF-86 question regarding the same issue. Nothing in her highly\ncredible testimony shows that this was anything more than a lack of understanding of\nhow the law was applied to her during the group trial and discussion, reenforced by\nsubsequent job screenings where the issue was never raised. Applicant\u2019s answer may\nhave been in error, and, as expungement is meant to do, it may have worked to her\nadvantage. There is no evidence, however, that her answer was devised to mislead.\nOver a decade has past since she was arrested and convicted of theft. She is\ncontrite and embarrassed over the incident, There is substantial evidence of\nrehabilitation during the interceding period of time. There is scant risk she would ever\n\n9\nput herself in a similar position again. As a high school student, she was ill-advised of\nthe repercussions of her actions and how the consequences differed for her, as\nopposed to her juvenile peers. Nothing in her life experience intimated that her\ninterpretation of how her record read was incorrect; indeed, her experience was that the\nincident must have been erased or it would have been raised previously. Her testimony\non this matter was credible. While some of her statements indicated some degree of\ninconsistency over the years, none of those statements were markedly irreconcilable\nwith her testimony as a whole. Applicant has met her burden in mitigating both criminal\nconduct and personal conduct security concerns. I conclude it is clearly consistent with\nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is granted.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September\n1, 2006. \nIn a June 24, 2010, response, Applicant admitted six of the 11 allegations raised\nunder Guideline J, all three allegations raised under Guideline H, two of the five\nallegations raised under Guideline E, and three of the five allegations raised under\nGuideline F. Applicant declined a hearing, but the Government requested that a hearing\nbe held. DOHA assigned the case to me on September 10, 2010. The parties proposed\na hearing date of October 29, 2010. A notice setting that date for the hearing was\nissued on September 30, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. At the onset of\nthe hearing, the Government moved to withdraw the allegations under Guideline F and\nNovember 19, 2010\n\n Tr. 16, 35.\n      1\n Tr. 45.\n      2\n Id.\n      3\n Tr. 19-21.\n      4\n Tr. 34-35.\n      5\n Tr. 35-36.\n      6\n2\nallegation 3.d under Guideline E. Similarly, the Government moved to amend allegation\n3.c under Guideline E to change the date of April 2004 to April 2002. Lacking any\nobjections, I granted the motions and the SOR was amended as noted. Applicant gave\ntestimony and presented no documents for consideration. Department Counsel offered\n16 documents, which were admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-16 without objection. The\ntranscript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on November 9, 2010, and the record\nwas closed. Based on a review of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find\nApplicant failed to meet his burden of mitigating security concerns related to personal\nconduct. Clearance denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old assembler who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since 2006. He earned a high school diploma and attended some college.\nHe is currently single and he is helping support his two young children. \nIn 1996, when he was in high school, Applicant started using marijuana\noccasionally.

He believes that completion of substance abuse awareness courses\nled to the dismissal of any related charges.   He quit using drugs in 2005.  He last\n4\n5\npurchased drugs at some time earlier.6\nBetween February 2000 and March 2008, Applicant was cited for multiple\noffenses by law enforcement. In February 2000, Applicant was charged with reckless\ndriving. In November 2001, he was found guilty of possession of marijuana, sentenced\nto fines, ordered to complete a substance abuse awareness course, and had his\ndriver\u2019s license restricted for six months. The charge was then dismissed in 2003. In the\ninterim, in about January 2002, he was found guilty of driving with a suspended license,\nfined, given 30 days (suspended), and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six\nmonths. In December 2002, he was charged with driving with a suspended license. In\nJanuary 2004, he pled guilty to the charge of possession of marijuana, sentenced to\nfines, put on probation, had his license restricted, and was referred to a substance\nabuse awareness course.

In December 2004, Applicant was found guilty of possession of\nmarijuana, sentenced to fines, given a restricted driver\u2019s license, referred to a\nsubstance abuse awareness program, and his probation was extended. In June 2007,\nhe was charged with drug possession after marijuana belonging to an acquaintance\nwas found within Applicant\u2019s control during a traffic stop. Applicant ultimately pled guilty\nto possession of drug paraphernalia and fined.  In January 2008 and in March 2008, he\n7\nwas charged with driving under a revoked driver\u2019s license, but the charges were\ndismissed when he appeared in court to show that he had a valid license. With regard\nto the dismissed cases against him regarding suspended or revoked license, Applicant\ncredibly explained that such cases are dismissed upon a showing of a valid driver\u2019s\nlicense.  He currently has a valid, unrestricted driver\u2019s license.\n8\n9\n In his response to the 2010 SOR, Applicant denied that he falsified material\nfacts when he failed to list marijuana use between 1999 and 2005 in response to\nSection 24: (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity) of his September 8, 2006,\nsecurity clearance application (SCA).  Section 24 asked, \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the\n10\nlast 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for\nexample, marijuana. . . .\u201d In explanation, Applicant wrote in his SOR answer, \u201cI was\nunder the impression they meant a user. Yes, I have smoked every now and then but\nnot a user.\u201d  In a July 2008 interrogatory, when asked how marijuana affected him,\n11\nApplicant wrote, \u201cN/A don\u2019t use, havent [sic] in a good long while like I said.\nConsiderably long while. I\u2019ve smoked marijuana a few times when I was a little\nyounger.\u201d  In a March 2007 interview, he implied that his \u201cpast drug use was not\n12\npertinent because [his marijuana possession] charges were dismissed, as if it they [sic]\nnever happened.\u201d  At the hearing, he stated, \u201cI thought they were saying as far as, you\n13\nknow, if you used it every day. Now. . . if you are at a party, you take a  couple of hits\noff somebody, I don\u2019t really consider that using drugs.\u201d14\n\n Tr. 8, 41.

See also Ex. 3 (Interrogatories, dated Jul. 14, 2008) at 7.\n      19\n Tr. 41-43.\n      20\n Ex. 2 (Interrogatories, dated May 15, 2009) at 29 of 32.\n      21\n Id.\n      22\n4\nApplicant denied falsifying material facts in response to Section 23 (Your Police\nRecord) of his SCA when he failed to disclose three charges for possession of\nmarijuana that resulted in his attendance of substance abuse awareness programs in\n2001 and 2004.  He wrote, \u201c(b)ecause I believed . . . these charges were removed\n15\nfrom my entire record, thus never happened is what I was told.\u201d  In forming this belief,\n16\nApplicant relied on information offered by counsel or suggested by the authorities. He\nequates the term \u201ccharged\u201d with \u201cconvicted.\u201d  \n17\nDuring a March 2, 2007, interview with a DOD investigator, Applicant noted his\ntwo 2004 arrests, convictions, and referrals to substance abuse awareness courses, but\nfailed to mention a similar incident from 2001. In response to the SOR, Applicant wrote\nthat he admitted the SOR allegation at \u00b6 3.b, but wrote, \u201cI told the investigator\neverything I believed to be true\u201d and claimed he had remembered all the incidents.18\nWhen interviewed by a DOD investigator in September 2007, Applicant\ndiscussed his 2001 and 2004 drug arrests. He failed, however, to disclose his recent\n2007 marijuana possession charge, to which he was ultimately found guilty of drug\nparaphernalia possession and fined. In response to SOR allegation \u00b6 3.a, Applicant\nwrote that he did not mention the incident because, \u201cthe charge was still pending and\n[his] lawyer led [him] to believe [he] would win the case.\u201d  At the hearing, he testified\n19\nthat he assumed that if the matter was dismissed, there was no reason to mention it.20\nIn a May 2009 interrogatory, Applicant expressed his contrition for failing to\nreport all adverse information. He acknowledged he had made a mistake.  He stated\n21\nthat he \u201cunderstood how important these incidents are\u201d and expressed his \u201cfuture intent\nof reporting any reportable incidents.\u201d22\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      23\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      24\n Id.\n      25\n Id.\n      26\n5\nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n23\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n24\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n25\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.26\n\n AG \u00b6 30.\n      27\n6\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the most\npertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to these AGs that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is that \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d27\nIn this case, Appellant admitted multiple allegations regarding drug-related charges\nbetween 2000 and 2007. Such facts are sufficient to raise both Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses)\nand AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Consequently, it is\nApplicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security concerns raised.\nAppellant quit using marijuana five years ago. He credibly explained that his\n2007 conviction of possession of drug paraphernalia was the result of an acquaintance\nleaving some marijuana in his car. Applicant now understands the importance of\neschewing not only the use of drugs, but also his contact with drugs. Given his wise\nchoice in quitting marijuana in 2005 and his appreciation of how he came to be\nconvicted of paraphernalia possession in June 2007, I find that Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) applies.\nThere is insufficient record evidence to fully explore the application of AG \u00b6 32(d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community service). In light\nof his contrition and both his continued and successful employment since 2006,\nhowever, that condition applies to a limited extent.  \nApplicant understands the criminal nature of his past association with marijuana.\nThere is no evidence he will again knowingly involve himself in criminal activity. Criminal\nconduct security concerns are mitigated.  \n\n AG  \u00b6 24.\n      28\n Id. at \u00b6 24(a)(1-2).\n      29\n Id. at  \u00b6 24(b).\n      30\n7\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.  \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances,\n28\nand include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other\nsubstances.  \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\n29\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.  \n30\nApplicant admitted he used marijuana, a controlled substance, from high school\nuntil 2005. He was subsequently found in the possession of marijuana in 2007, an\nincident that was reduced to possession of drug paraphernalia. Such facts are sufficient\nto raise Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 25 (a) (any drug abuse) and AG\n\u00b6 25 (c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia). With disqualifying\nconditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate related security concerns.\nApplicant used marijuana with some regularity while he lived with roommates\nbetween 1996 and 1999. He then reduced his drug use significantly before he quit\nusing marijuana in 2005. Although he was charged for marijuana possession in 2007,\nthe charge was reduced to possession of drug paraphernalia when it was determined\nthe marijuana discovered was not his. He has had no subsequent drug-related\nincidents. There is no indication he plans to use illegal drugs in the future. Drug\nInvolvement Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 26 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\napplies. \nThere is insufficient evidence to raise AG \u00b6 26 (b)(1) (disassociation from drug-\nusing associates and contacts) or AG \u00b6 26 (b)(2) (changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used). It is notable, however, that Applicant, who started abusing\nmarijuana as a teen, is now 32 years of age. He quit using the drug five years ago. He\nhas not been involved with drugs in over three years, when he was convicted of\npossession of an acquaintance\u2019s drug paraphernalia under unique circumstances. In\nlight of these facts, I find that AG \u00b6 16 (b) (3) (an appropriate period of abstinence)\napplies. However, AG \u00b6 26 (b) (4) (a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation) does not apply. \n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      31\n Id.\n      32\n8\nAfter nine years of using marijuana, Applicant has been drug-free for over five\nyears. His last noted contact with drugs was in June 2007. There is no indication that he\nwill use drugs again in the future. Drug Involvement security concerns are mitigated.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n31\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  Here,\n32\nApplicant failed to fully disclose all of his drug charges and arrests in interviews\nconducted in March 2007 and September 2007 (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b). In\naddition, in his September 2006 SCA, Applicant failed to note three possession of\nmarijuana charges from 2001 and 2004 in a question regarding his police record (SOR\nallegation \u00b6 3.c), and he failed to disclose his use of marijuana between 1999 and 2005\n(SOR allegation \u00b6 3.e).  \nAs a preliminary matter, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that\nApplicant deliberately intended to mislead or falsify facts when regard to SOR\nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c. Regarding SOR allegation \u00b6 3.a, Applicant has\nconsistently stated that, in light of his attorney\u2019s assurance of a successful case, he did\nnot need to disclose his then-pending June 2007 charge of marijuana possession to\ninvestigators in September 2007. Regarding SOR allegation \u00b6 3.b, Applicant repeatedly\nhas stated or written that he thought that successful completion of the substance abuse\nawareness programs that led to the dismissals of his previous marijuana possession\ncharges effectively removed them from his police record, making them nullities. His\nstatements to this effect have been consistent since 2007. This misunderstanding also\naffected his incomplete answer to Section 23 (Your Police Record) on his 2006 SCA\n(SOR allegation \u00b6 3.c). It is clear that Applicant, who has a high school diploma and\nattended some college, is unskilled with legal and law enforcement terminology, and\nthat he relied on the advice of others. He similarly displayed an inability to distinguish\nbetween the terms \u201ccharged\u201d and \u201cconvicted,\u201d and believed anything \u201cdismissed\u201d is\nconstructively expunged. In light of his credible testimony, his background, and his\nconsistent remarks regarding these failures, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s\nomissions were intentional or fraudulent.  \nLacking significantly less semantic nuance, however, is his interpretation of SCA\nSection 24 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity), which directly asks whether an\napplicant has illegally used any controlled substances, including marijuana, since the\nage of 16 or in the preceding seven years. While Applicant admitted he had been\ncharged for marijuana possession in a related question, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nquestion about past drug use. Applicant argues that he answered in the negative\n\n9\nbecause he only smoked marijuana \u201cevery now and then\u201d and, therefore, he was not a\nuser. At best, this argument is self-serving and lacks merit; at worst, it reflects poor\njudgment and reliability. The question does not break past illegal drug ingestion into\nseparate categories, nor does it imply a threshold at which a certain amount of\nmarijuana consumption defines a \u201cuser\u201d versus a non-user. It simply asks about past\nillegal use of drugs. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16 (a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) applies. With a PC DC raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate\nthe security concerns.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant immediately disclosed complete facts about\nhis past marijuana use in sufficient time to raise Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition\n(PC MC) AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts). \nFailure to honestly disclose full and complete answers on the SCA undermines\nthe investigative process and provides evidence of unreliability and untrustworthiness. If\nanything helps alleviate the severity of Applicant\u2019s failure to report his past drug abuse,\nit is the fact that he did fully detail his past drug possession charge, thus giving\ninvestigators some indication that criminal activity and drugs could be issues. Moreover,\nwhile other omissions from his SCA may be mitigated because of semantic\nmisunderstandings, Section 24 is straightforward. If there was any confusion as to its\nmeaning, an applicant would best demonstrate good judgment and reliability by first\nasking for clarification about the question or consider the question in its context, not\nsummarily deny past illegal drug consumption. However, this is the only omission that\nthe facts tend to show is intentional, and it occurred over four years ago. Therefore, AG\n\u00b6 17 (c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) applies in part. Furthermore, the candor subsequently displayed by Applicant\nin his interviews with DOD investigators is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress). None of the other PC MCs apply. Under this guideline,\npersonal conduct security concerns related to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3c are mitigated,\nbut related concerns regarding \u00b6 3.e are mitigated only in part. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based on careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept. \n\n10\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a 32-year-old assembler who has reliably held the same position\nsince 2006. He is a high school graduate. He is single and responsibly helping support\nhis two children. While living with roommates from 1996 until 1999, he used marijuana\nwith some frequency. That use then tapered until he quit using the drug in 2005, during\nwhich time he was convicted of marijuana possession three times. He continued\nassociating with drug users until at least 2007, when he was convicted of drug\nparaphernalia possession. Applicant intends to remain drug-free.\nApplicant\u2019s past drug use and any significant criminal conduct are inextricably\nintertwined. He has not been involved with drugs for several years. While there are\nother charges noted for criminal activity, such lesser crimes were apparently caused by\ndisputes concerning whether he had or was eligible for a valid driver\u2019s license. To the\nextent such charges were dismissed when Applicant showed the court he had a valid\ndriver\u2019s license, those charges only reflect a certain laxity in carrying his permit at all\ntimes. Absent evidence his state requires its drivers to carry a driver\u2019s license at all\ntimes, which it apparently does not, these incidents are of comparatively minor\nsignificance to a determination of Applicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was generally credible throughout the hearing, and his\ntestimony was usually consistent with interrogatories and interviews conducted since\n2007. His explanation about why he failed to disclose his drug possession arrests was\ncredible and plausible, especially given his age, education, and the fact he relied on the\nadvice of others. What is less consistent and plausible, however, is his explanation as\nto why he denied past drug use in response to Section 24 on his SCA. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s testimony and his answer to the SOR, someone who smoked\nmarijuana \u201cevery now and then\u201d or would take \u201ca couple of hits off somebody\u201d at parties\nis still someone who has illegally used marijuana. Moreover, his offered distinction\nbetween the meanings of \u201cuse\u201d and a \u201cuser\u201d stands in stark contrast to his July 2008\ncomment conceding past drug use when he stated \u201cdon\u2019t use, havent [sic] in a good\nlong while.\u201d This response shows that Applicant appreciated that he had used\nmarijuana, even if his use had not been recent. Here, Applicant had only quit using\nmarijuana in 2005, so his answer to Section 24 should have been \u201cyes.\u201d Although it is\nrecognized that the passage of three years is a long time to one in his 20s, his answer\nreflects a general intent to minimize the scope of his past drug involvement.\nIn his May 2009 interrogatory, Applicant expressed contrition for his failure to\nreport his past drug use. While some current use of the vernacular may mean that a\n\u201cuser\u201d signifies regular or habitual drug use, its application in this context is self-serving\nand minimizes the scope of one\u2019s drug involvement. Applicant\u2019s failure to fully disclose\nhis past drug use is worrisome. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. Any\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information. Given the\nsecurity concerns remaining under Guideline E and the whole-person analysis,\npersonal conduct security concerns are unmitigated. Clearance is denied.   \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d: \nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline F:\nWITHDRAWN\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance denied.\nARTHUR E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, received October 15, 2007, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. He did not provide additional information to support his 2 request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 1967. He is a widower and has three children. 3 Applicant admitted in his 2007 security clearance application to a charge of buying drugs in 1988. In fact, he was charged with attempt to possess cocaine (felony) in 1991. He was found guilty and he was put on probation. There are no other details in his SF 86 about his history of drug abuse.4 Applicant used crack cocaine from at least April 2004 until January 2005. He reports that the use was approximately 15 to 20 times. However, he does not recall the exact number of times nor the exact dates. During this time period, Applicant held a 5 security clearance. In January 2005, Applicant was working and had to provide a urine sample for a random drug test. Applicant was informed by his employer that his urine sample tested 6 positive for cocaine. Applicant was placed on unpaid leave until he completed a drug rehabilitation class. He attended classes for 6-8 weeks. The Applicant attended three or four times a week according to his recollection. He returned to work in March or April 2005. He reports attending Narcotics Anonymous after that for three or four months. He did not continue. ",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 3, 2007, and elected to\nhave his decision on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on December 13, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on December 21, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to\nfile objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s\nMarch 27, 2008\n\nDepartment Counsel submitted six items in support of her contentions.\n1\nItem 3 (Answer, signed October 15, 2007).\n2\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application, dated May 7,2007).\n3\nId.\n4\nItem 4 at 25.\n5\nItems 3, 5, and 6.\n6\nItem 6 (Response to Interrogatories, dated August 7, 2007).\n7\n2\ncase.  Applicant did not submit additional information. The case was assigned to me on\n1\nMarch 13, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received October 15, 2007, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations in the SOR.  He did not provide additional information to support his\n2\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since October 1967.  He is a widower and has three children. \n3\nApplicant admitted in his 2007 security clearance application to a charge of\nbuying drugs in 1988. In fact, he was charged with attempt to possess cocaine (felony)\nin 1991. He was found guilty and he was put on probation. There are no other details in\nhis SF 86 about his history of drug abuse.4\nApplicant used crack cocaine from at least April 2004 until January 2005. He\nreports that the use was approximately 15 to 20 times. However, he does not recall the\nexact number of times nor the exact dates.  During this time period, Applicant held a\n5\nsecurity clearance.\nIn January 2005, Applicant was working and had to provide a urine sample for a\nrandom drug test.  Applicant was informed by his employer that his urine sample tested\n6\npositive for cocaine. Applicant was placed on unpaid leave until he completed a drug\nrehabilitation class. He attended classes for 6-8 weeks. The Applicant attended three or\nfour times a week according to his recollection. He returned to work in March or April\n2005. He reports attending Narcotics Anonymous after that for three or four months. He\ndid not continue.  Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence to support his\n7\nattendance at drug treatment.\nApplicant purchased cocaine from a man on the streets. He paid cash for the\ncocaine but does not recall how much he actually bought. He reported using the drug on\n\nId.\n8\nItem 6\n9\nId.\n10\n3\nweekends. If he had extra money, he would purchase and use more cocaine. He\nenjoyed the way cocaine made him feel. He also thought it would help with the sense of\nloss after his wife died. Before failing the drug test, he had no problems at work. He\ndenies selling drugs to anyone. He does not believe he was addicted to cocaine. He did\nnot seek any counseling outside of the mandatory work program.8\nApplicant regrets using crack cocaine and wasting his money.  He also stated in\n9\nhis interview with the Department of Defense investigators in October 2006 that he does\nnot intend to use any illegal drugs for the rest of his life.  \n10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Applicant admitted using\ncocaine in 2004-2005. Similarly, AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use\u201d is a\ndisqualifying condition. Applicant tested positive for cocaine during a random test at\nwork in January 2005. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nUnder AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is\nalso potentially disqualifying. In 2004-2005, Applicant purchased cocaine and\npossessed. He admitted that he did so on many occasions. He also had an earlier\ncharge for attempt to possess cocaine in 1991. He was a mature adult at that time. Not\nonly that, Applicant was working and held a security clearance when he was using\ncocaine. Thus, AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance\u201d is an applicable disqualifying condition in this case. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26 (a), the disqualifying conditions\n\n5\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nillegal use occurred numerous times and as recent as 2005. I do not find that this\nmitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26 (b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation. As noted above, Applicant provided no\nadditional information in response to the FORM. He provided no documentary evidence\nconcerning his rehabilitation program and treatment. Also, he has not had a sufficient\nperiod of abstinence for mitigation. In addition, his comments do not convince me of his\nfuture intentions not to use illegal drugs in light of his use of drugs while holding a\nsecurity clearance.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\ncommunity standing.\nApplicant\u2019s use of an illegal drug shows not only poor judgment, but a disregard\nof the law. In addition, using an illegal drug while holding a security clearance\ndemonstrates a disregard for the trust that the Government placed in him when it\ngranted him a security clearance. This could make him vulnerable when he has access\nto classified information. I have doubts about his reliability and judgment. I find his\npersonal conduct creates a vulnerability and raises a security concern under the above\ndisqualifying condition. After reviewing the mitigating conditions, I do not find that any\napply.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been employed for\nmany years with his current employer and has held a security clearance. He has no\ndocumented problems at work prior to the drug test in 2005. However, he did not alert\nhis employer about his drug problems. If he had not been tested, he may still be using\nan illegal drug. He used cocaine in 1991 and then resorted to it in 2004. Granted, he\nlost his wife, but that is no excuse for resort to an illegal drug. He bought cocaine many\ntimes. Applicant reports that he completed the mandatory drug program, but he has\nproduced no documentation to support this claim. He did not provide any record of his\ntreatment or prognosis. Nevertheless, I accept his statement about completing\ntreatment and attending Narcotics Anonymous for 3-4 months as truthful and accurate.\nHis drug use is recent. He was a mature adult at the time that he used cocaine.\nApplicant does not convince me that his poor judgment is not likely to recur. His poor\njudgment to revert to drugs in his 50's is troubling. Applicant has not met his burden of\nproof in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement and personal conduct.\n \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a, in part. SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges the same behavior alleged under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d. Applicant admitted under SOR \u00b6 2.a only the corresponding allegations to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.

After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 64-year-old systems engineer working for a defense contractor as a proposal manager for government contracts (Tr. 32, e-QIP). He assists government contractors preparing and responding to the government\u2019s requests for proposals. Applicant\u2019s education is extensive.

Abramson, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nFrom approximately 1995 to February 2005, Applicant engaged in exhibitionistic \nfantasies that cause security concerns under the guidelines for sexual behavior and \npersonal conduct. He stopped his questionable behavior in February 2005, attended \ncounseling, and disclosed his behavior to his wife. He has lost interest in his \nexhibitionistic fantasies because of physiological and cognitive reasons. He has learned \nhis lesson, and the likelihood of recurrence is remote. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 28, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On November 28, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJuly 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleged security concerns \nunder Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 29, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 19, 2009. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on May 4, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, presented the testimony of an expert witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) 1 through 12, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on May 11, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a, in part. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges the same behavior alleged under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d. Applicant \nadmitted under SOR \u00b6 2.a only the corresponding allegations to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nHe denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, and the corresponding allegations under SOR \u00b6 2.a. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 64-year-old systems engineer working for a defense contractor as \na proposal manager for government contracts (Tr. 32, e-QIP). He assists government \ncontractors preparing and responding to the government\u2019s requests for proposals. \nApplicant\u2019s education is extensive. He completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics in \n1972, received his master\u2019s degree in business administration (accounting) in 1974, and \nearned his doctorate in business administration in the management of science \ntechnology and innovation in 1992 (Tr. 34, e-QIP). Applicant has been married to his \nsecond wife since 1999. He has two adult children of his first marriage. His current wife \nhas three adult children of her prior marriage. \n \nApplicant has had access to classified information since his first job out of college \nat age 21 (Tr. 36). During the last 40 years, he has had access to classified information \nat different levels (including top secret with access to sensitive compartmented \ninformation (SCI)) on and off depending on the needs of his job. He worked for \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \ngovernment agencies and government contractors in specialized positions requiring \nsophisticated knowledge of systems and science. Throughout his career, Applicant has \nmade significant contributions to the government identifying and solving problems \ninvolving a variety of sensitive systems.  \n \nIn 2004, Applicant committed a security violation because he took home \nclassified information that was mixed in with unclassified documents. The next day, \nApplicant reported the incident to his supervisor and his security officer (AE 4). Other \nthan this incident, there is no evidence that Applicant has compromised or caused \nothers to compromise classified information (Tr. 57). According to Applicant\u2019s past \nreports of investigation and background interviews, there was nothing suggesting in his \nbackground, conduct, or character that could have resulted in his exploitation or \nblackmail (AE 2-4). \n \nIn November 2004, Applicant was sponsored by a government agency for \nreinstatement of his access to SCI. During a February 2005 polygraph-assisted \ninterview, Applicant disclosed behaviors that raise security concerns both under \nGuidelines D and E, specifically: \n \n\u2022 From around 1995 to February 2005 (the day of his interview), he dressed and \nundressed in front of his walk-in closet window with the drapes/blinds open, \napproximately two to three times a week (GE 3). The windows faced his \nneighbor\u2019s driveway and home.  \n \nApplicant admitted he dressed and undressed in front of his walk-in closet \nwindow with the drapes/blinds open regularly (Tr. 68-69). He explained he was \nengaging in acts of fantasy of exhibitionism, and that he never engaged in actual \nexhibitionism because he never actually exposed himself to anyone. He became \nsexually aroused fantasizing that someone was observing him dressing or undressing \n(Tr. 110). He explained that he was always careful to ensure that no one was close to \nhis home or in the woods, because he did not want to actually be seen. He claimed he \nis a shy person and would not have done it if he knew someone was capable of seeing \nhim. His home was protected by a fence and surrounded by tall woods. The nearest \nhome and street were far enough from his home that it would have been difficult for \nanyone to see him with the naked eye.  \n \n\u2022 From around 1995 to November 2004, while staying in hotels, Applicant would \nexit the shower naked and walked toward his hotel\u2019s room window while the \ncurtains/blinds were open. He would do this for his sexual arousal two to three \ntimes a week while travelling. \n \nApplicant denied walking naked in front of a hotel window with the curtains/blinds \nopen (Tr. 113). He stated: \u201cI may have opened the curtains slightly so that no one could \nactually see me; but that I could imagine that someone could see me\u201d (Tr. 113). He \nclaimed he was engaging in acts of fantasy of exhibitionism, that he never intended to \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nexpose himself to anyone, and that he never exposed himself to anyone. At his hearing, \nhe explained that he was extremely careful and never opened the drapes/blinds \ncompletely, because he did not want to actually be seen. At the hotels, his fantasy was \nnot as satisfying as when he did it at home because he was afraid of getting caught. His \nfear of actual detection detracted from his fantasy.2  \n \n\u2022 Between about 1999 and June 2002, and between December 2004 and January \n2005, Applicant drove to and from work with his penis exposed outside of his \npants to play with himself and become sexually aroused (Tr. 70, 107-109). On \none occasion, in February 2005, he masturbated to the point of ejaculation while \ndriving to work. \n \nApplicant admitted the above facts at his hearing. He claimed his actions were \nnot an act of exhibitionism, because he never intended to expose himself to anyone. He \nexplained he was traveling on single lane roads at low speeds, and when a car \napproached he covered himself. He further explained that this was a very stressful \nperiod for him. Because of his wife\u2019s health problems, he had been unable to have \nsexual relations for an extended time, and he was pending a prostate needle biopsy to \ndetect possible cancer, which later tested positive for prostate cancer.  \n \nApplicant did not consider his stressful situation an excuse for his actions. He \nexpressed regret for his indiscretion and promised it would never happen again. He \ntestified that as a result of his interview and subsequent embarrassment he has never \nengaged in similar conduct again. \n \n\u2022 Between about 1996 and February 2005, Applicant periodically urinated off the \nbalcony of his home. He also defecated in his yard approximately once a year. \nApplicant engaged in this behavior for his personal gratification. \n \nApplicant explained he engaged in these acts for his private gratification, and that \nthese were not acts of exhibitionism. He was always careful to ensure that no one could \nobserve him in these acts. His home was protected by a fence and surrounded by \nwoods, and far enough from the nearest home and street that it would have been \ndifficult for anyone to see him. He urinated and defecated in his property because of the \ngood feeling of freedom he received. He equated his actions to that of \u201cmarking\u201d his \nproperty. He denied engaging in these acts for sexual arousal.3 \n \nApplicant expressed embarrassment and regret for his actions numerous times \nthroughout his hearing. After his 2005 interview, he was so embarrassed that he has \nnever again engaged in any of the conduct alleged in the SOR. Before the interview, he \n \n2  The August 2000 report of interview indicates Applicant stated he was aroused by hoping \nsomeone would see him undressed (GE 3).  \n \n3  The August 2000 report of interview indicates Applicant stated he urinated and defecated on \nhis property for sexual gratification (GE 3). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconsidered all his behavior \u201cprivate,\u201d because his actions were on his own property, or \nhe always made sure no one actually observed him. According to Applicant, no one \never saw him engaging in this private behavior and he had not told anyone about it. He \ndisclosed his \u201cprivate\u201d behavior during his polygraph-assisted interview because he was \nasked to disclose any behavior that a police officer would consider illegal if the police \nofficer was present.  \n \nAfter his February 2005, interview, he realized the potential negative \nconsequences of his past behavior and completely stopped (Tr. 119-123). He now \nunderstands his behavior was inappropriate for someone of his age, status, and \neducation (Tr. 135). Applicant disclosed his questionable behavior to his wife after the \n2005 interview (Tr. 125). In January 2009, he sought counseling/therapy to help him \ndeal with his behavior and to learn to communicate better with his wife (Tr. 89). \nApplicant has not disclosed any of his questionable behavior with his employer, other \nrelatives, or friends. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of a psychologist as an expert \nwitness (Tr. 147-227). The Doctor assessed Applicant on March 18 and 24, 2009. After \nnumerous tests and two personal interviews, the Doctor concluded Applicant does not \nsuffer from any clinically diagnosable emotional disorder. He believes Applicant has not \nengaged in similar questionable behavior since February 2005. In his opinion, \nApplicant\u2019s recurrence is unlikely for the following reasons: (1) Applicant\u2019s sincere \nremorse and embarrassment; (2) he is extremely intelligent with a superior range of \nintellectual functioning, verbal reasoning, and social convention; and (3) the drive for \nApplicant\u2019s fantasies has decreased both from a physiological and cognitive level.  \n \nIn 2005, Applicant received surgery to address his prostate cancer, and he is in \nremission. As a result of his operation, he now suffers from erectile dysfunction, and \nreduced libido (Tr. 91). He also moved from his house to a condominium. In reference \nto the cognitive level, the Doctor believes the fantasies do not work for Applicant now \nbecause they do not make sense for him anymore. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 12 the government concern is that: \n \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \n  \nBetween approximately 1995 and February 2005, Applicant drove to and from \nwork with his penis outside of his pants. He also urinated and defecated in his yard, \ndressed/undressed in front of an open window, and walked naked in front of his hotel\u2019s \nroom windows. Applicant engaged in this questionable behavior for his own sexual \narousal and gratification.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raised security concerns under AG \u00b6 13: \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.5  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 14 provides three mitigating conditions that, considering the totality of the \ncircumstances are present in this case and mitigate Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior security \nconcerns:  \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s questionable sexual behavior was, to a certain extent, private and \ndiscreet. There is no evidence he was ever seen by anyone performing one of his \nexhibitionistic fantasies. He last engaged in questionable sexual behavior in February \n2005. Since then, he disclosed his behavior to his wife and participated in counseling. \n \n \n5  I find AG \u00b6 13 (b): \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that \nthe person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder,\u201d does not apply. The \nevidence is not sufficient to show Applicant has a personality disorder, and he stopped his questionable \nbehavior in 2005. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAs a result of his prostate cancer operation, Applicant has decreased libido and suffers \nfrom erectile dysfunction. He has lost interest in his exhibitionistic fantasies.  \n \n  \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his past behavior and promised never to \nengage in similar conduct again. Moreover, as a result of the security clearance \nprocess, Applicant has learned his lesson and is fully aware of the potential negative \nconsequences of his past questionable sexual behavior to his ability to hold a security \nclearance.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s questionable past sexual behavior (as discussed above under the \nsexual behavior guideline) triggers the applicability of AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides three conditions that mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n  \nAs stated above in the discussion concerning the applicability of mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 14, Applicant\u2019s questionable sexual behavior was, to a certain \n\n \n9 \n \n \nextent, private and discreet. There is no evidence he was ever seen by anyone \nperforming one of his exhibitionistic fantasies. He last engaged in questionable behavior \nin February 2005. Since then, he disclosed his past behavior to his wife, security \nofficials, and participated in counseling. As a result of his 2005 prostate cancer \noperation, Applicant has decreased libido and suffers from erectile dysfunction. He has \nlost interest in his exhibitionistic fantasies. He mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. During a 10-year period, Applicant \ndrove to and from work with his penis outside of his pants. He also urinated and \ndefecated in his yard, dressed/undressed in front of an open window at his residence, \nand walked naked in front of his hotel room\u2019s windows. He engaged in this questionable \nbehavior for his own sexual arousal and gratification. Applicant placed himself at risk, \ndemonstrated questionable judgment, and an unwillingness to follow/comply with social \nrules of conduct. He also risked criminal prosecution for exposing himself to others. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant is a mature, well-educated man, and a good \nhusband and father. He has successfully worked for government agencies and defense \ncontractors since age 21. He has had access to classified information on-and-off during \nthe last 40 years. The only security violation on record occurred in 2004 when Applicant \nself-reported taking classified information home by mistake. There is no evidence this \nmistake resulted in the compromise of classified information. Through his many years of \ngovernment service, Applicant has made significant contributions to the government \nand government contractors.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his past behavior. He stopped his \nquestionable behavior in February 2005, and promised never to engage in similar \nconduct again. Applicant has learned his lesson and is fully aware of the potential \nnegative consequences of engaging in questionable sexual behavior to his ability to \nhold a security clearance. I find that Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior is unlikely to \nrecur, does not cast doubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment, and that he has taken positive steps to reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant disclosed his questionable behavior to his wife and participated in \ncounseling. His 2005 prostate cancer operation has reduced his libido and he now \nsuffers from erectile dysfunction. He has lost interest in his exhibitionistic fantasies. The \ndrive for Applicant\u2019s fantasies has decreased both from a physiological and cognitive \nlevel. For all the foregoing reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the sexual \nbehavior and personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant has neither invalidated the\npassport nor obtained formal approval for its use. Further, Applicant is potentially subject to foreign\ninfluence because of his family contacts\u2014his father and sister are resident citizens of Iran\u2014and his\nfrequent travel to Iran to address his father\u2019s health issues. Eligibility for ADP-I/II/III position\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive).\n1\n2\nOn 9 April 1993, the Composite Health Care System Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD C I) entered into a memorandum of\n3\nagreement for DOHA to conduct trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January 1987.\nApplicant challenges the 23 August 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his trustworthiness determination\nbecause of foreign preference and foreign influence.  He answered the SOR 18 September 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 22 October 2007 and I convened a hearing 28\nNovember 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 6 December 2007.\n \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\n At hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to take official notice of certain U.S.\nGovernment publications as they pertain to Iran (Tr. 23).\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.a. and 1.d. Accordingly, I\nincorporate those admissions as findings of fact.\nApplicant\u2014a 48-year-old food service general manager employed by a defense contractor\nsince September 1979\u2014seeks a trustworthiness determination for access to the military installation\nwhere his company provides food services. This is his first background investigation.\nApplicant was born in Iran in February 1959. He immigrated to the U.S. in about 1976 to\nattend college, but became a legal permanent resident of the U.S. after the royal Iranian government\nwas overthrown in 1979. He married a native-born U.S. citizen in December 1989. They have two\ndaughters, born May 1991 and August 1998, both born in the U.S. Applicant and his wife own their\nhome in the U.S., and all their financial interests are here.\nAlthough Applicant denies being a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran, he acknowledged that\nIran considers him a citizen (G.E. 1). He applied for an Iranian passport sometime before 2001, which\nhe used to travel to Iran in 2001, 2004, and 2006. He renewed this passport in March 2007; it expires\nin March 2012. He intends to maintain this passport so he can travel to Iran to see his ill father, and\nthe sister who cares for him. He has no property interests in Iran.\nIn his July 2007 response to DOHA interrogatories (G.E. 2), Applicant acknowledged renewal\nof his Iranian passport and his intent to maintain it. Applicant has not surrendered his Iranian passport,\nand does not intend to. Although Applicant seems to grasp the concept that he cannot travel to Iran\non his U.S. passport because of the state of relations between the U.S. and Iran, and Iran\u2019s failure to\n\n3\nrecognize his U.S. citizenship, he apparently fails to grasp the converse concept that he is only able\nto obtain an Iranian passport because Iran considers him an Iranian citizen, and that his application\nfor an Iranian passport is an assertion of Iranian citizenship on his part. In short, he fails to see why\nhis possession and use of an Iranian passport raises security concerns.\nIran is a fundamentalist Islamic republic with a poor human rights record. Its relations with\nthe U.S. are confrontational and unlikely to improve given Iran\u2019s past efforts to acquire nuclear\nweapons, its sponsorship of, support for, and involvement in, international terrorism, and its support\nfor violent opposition to the Middle East peace process. Nevertheless, Iran is not a known collector\nof U.S. intelligence or sensitive economic information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain\nprotected information. \nTravel to Iran remains problematic. The Department of State\u2019s May 2007 Travel Warning\ncontinues to warn U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to Iran, noting that dual\nnational Iranian-American citizens may encounter difficulty in departing Iran. Some elements of the\nIranian government and population remain hostile to the U.S. Consequently, American citizens may\nbe subject to harassment or arrest while traveling or residing in Iran. Americans of Iranian origin are\nurged to consider the risk of being targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. In addition,\nIranian authorities may deny dual nationals access to the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran, because\nthey are considered to be solely Iranian citizens. Large-scale demonstrations have taken place in\nvarious regions throughout Iran over the past several years as a result of a sometimes volatile political\nclimate. U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the travel warning are urged to exercise caution.\nThe U.S. government does not currently have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, and, therefore, cannot provide protection or routine consular services to American\ncitizens in Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as protecting\npower for U.S. interests in Iran. Neither U.S. passports nor visas to the United States are issued in\nTehran. The Iranian government does not recognize dual citizenship and generally does not permit\nthe Swiss to provide protective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals. In addition,\nU.S. citizens of Iranian origin, who are considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens, have been detained\nand harassed by Iranian authorities.\n \nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list factors to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for public trust positions. Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances\npresented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the\nfactors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating\ncondition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance\ngoverning the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n3\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n4\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n5\n4\nPublic trust determinations resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for public trust positions. The government must prove,\nby something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it\ndoes so, it establishes a prima facie case against eligibility. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or\nmitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to eligibility, the Applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to public trust information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by showing that\nApplicant obtained an Iranian passport before 2001, used it to travel to Iran in 2001, 2004, and 2006,\nhad it renewed in March 2007, and is likely to use it to travel to Iran in the future, despite becoming\na naturalized U.S. citizen in the mid 1990s.  Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline C security\n3\nconcerns. Although he has been a dual citizen of Iran and the United States since his birth, his Iranian\ncitizenship would have little security significance if based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship. For his\nconduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, he must have acted in a way to indicate\na preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental\nimpact on the interests of the United States is not required before the government can seek to deny\naccess under Guideline C. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring those given public\ntrust positions will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also\nbe a citizen.\n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference. His dual\ncitizenship is not based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship, but is based on his active exercise of dual\ncitizenship after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  He has not expressed a willingness to renounce\n4\nhis foreign citizenship.   All exercise of dual citizenship occurred after he obtained U.S. citizenship,\n5\n\n\u00b6 11.(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n6\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11.(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n7\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n8\ninvalidated; \n\u00b6 6.\n9\n\u00b6 7.(a).\n10\n\u00b6 7.(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\n11\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country.\n5\nwhile he was an adult.  Applicant's use of his Iranian passport has not been sanctioned by the U.S.\n6\n7\nHe stated no willingness to invalidate his passport.  While Applicant has a legal right to maintain his\n8\ndual citizenship with its attendant benefits and responsibilities, he has not demonstrated that he can\nbe counted on to always act in preference to the United States. I resolve Guideline C against\nApplicant.\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may raise\neligibility concerns if the individual: 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n9\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if those\ncontacts create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.10\nIn this case, the government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B because\nhis father and sister are resident citizens of Iran. Considering first the foreign country involved, Iran\nand the U.S. have strained foreign relations at best. Although Iran is not a known collector of U.S.\nintelligence or sensitive economic information, or known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation, the fact that Iran does not recognize dual citizenship and considers such citizens to be\nsolely Iranian presents security concerns regarding his family members residing in Iran. Applicant\u2019s\ndivided loyalties are demonstrated by his travel to Iran in 2001, 2004, and 2006 and his intent to travel\nto Iran when needed in the future to deal with his father\u2019s health issues.  Ordinarily, travel to a\n11\nforeign country\u2014even a country of origin\u2014has no independent security significance, but serves to\ndemonstrate an Applicant\u2019s ties of affection to family members residing there. However, in this case\nApplicant travels to Iran to care for his ill father, and subjects himself to the jurisdiction of a\ngovernment that is hostile to the U.S., and considers him to be only an Iranian citizen and thus likely\nto be denied access to what little assistance is available to U.S. citizens through the U.S. Interests\n\n6\nSection in Tehran. Even though Iran is not an active collector of sensitive U.S. information, an\nindividual in Applicant\u2019s circumstances who travels to Iran is a potential target of opportunity that\nis an unacceptable risk of being coerced to provide information.

RIVERA\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFrancisco Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nFrom approximately 1993 to 2003, Applicant solicited and purchased the services of\nprostitutes around 18 times. His behavior raised security concerns under the personal conduct, sexual\nbehavior, and criminal conduct adjudicative guidelines. His favorable information, evidence of\nrehabilitation, and the passage of time are sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by his\nbehavior. Clearance is granted.\n\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n1\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n  Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant admitted using the services of a masseuse/prostitute only four to five times\n2\nover the course of four years.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline D (Sexual\nBehavior), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR informed\nApplicant that, based on available information, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary\naffirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to\nclassified information and submitted the case to an administrative judge for a security\ndetermination.  On July 27, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\n1\nThe case was assigned to me on September 4, 2007. The next day, a Notice of Hearing was\nissued convening a hearing on September 21, 2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The\ngovernment presented five exhibits, marked GE 1-5, to support the SOR. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf, and presented five exhibits, marked AE 1-5. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on\nOctober 1, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nAt the hearing, the government moved to amend the SOR to correct typographical mistakes\nin \u00b6 3.a, by deleting the numbers \u201c2007,\u201d and in \u00b6 3.b, by deleting the numbers \u201c138.34,\u201d and\nsubstituting the number \u201c134\u201d. Applicant did not object to the amendments, and I granted the motion\n(Tr. 14-16).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations.  His admissions are\n2\nincorporated herein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old computer systems technologist who has worked for Department\nof Defense (DoD) contractors for approximately five years. In October 1982, he enlisted in the U.S.\nAir Force shortly after completing high school, and served 20 years on active duty. In October 2002,\nhe retired as a Technology Sergeant (information technology specialist), pay grade E-6. The Air\nForce characterized his service as honorable. He was awarded the the Air Force Commendation\nMedal.\n\n  Under Article 134 of the UCMJ, soliciting and/or engaging the services of prostitutes is an offense when the\n3\nact is wrongful, and when under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and\ndiscipline or of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\n3\nApplicant married his wife in April 1985, and they were divorced in June 1993. They have\na daughter, age 20, out of this marriage. He has completed two associate degrees. In January 2001,\nhe obtained an associates degree in information technology. In March 2002, he completed his second\nassociates degree in computer science.\nApplicant has had access to classified information at the top secret level (sensitive\ncompartmented information (SCI)) for almost 24 years, including most of his 20 years of Air Force\nservice, and while working for defense contractors. Applicant\u2019s employment history reflects that\nsince his retirement in 2002 he has worked for two defense contractors. He has been working for his\ncurrent employer since July 2003. There is no evidence he has ever mishandled or compromised\nclassified information while serving in the Air Force or working for defense contractors. \nIn 2004, Applicant was denied access to classified information by another government\nagency. He was informed that he failed a polygraph examination, but he was not informed of the\nreasons why he failed the polygraph. He disclosed this information in his security clearance\napplication (GE 3). In his answers to DOHA interrogatories, and during an interview with a\ngovernment investigator, Applicant disclosed that he had solicited and engaged the services of\nprostitutes (GE 4). From approximately July 1993 to February 1994, while serving on active duty\nand while assigned to a U.S. military base in Japan, he solicited and engaged the services of\nprostitutes on approximately five to seven occasions. There is substantial evidence to establish that\nhis behavior was illegal under the UCMJ.  \n3\nFrom approximately May 1996 through May 2000, while in the service and stationed to a\nmilitary base in the state of Florida, Applicant solicited and engaged the services of prostitutes on\napproximately ten occasions. And, in May 2003, while working for a government contractor in\nFlorida, he solicited and engaged the services of prostitutes one time. I took administrative notice\nof Florida statute \u00a7 796.07, which makes it a second degree misdemeanor (for a first offense) to\nsolicit or to purchase the services of a prostitute.\nApplicant engaged the services of prostitutes after he divorced his wife, and never while he\nwas dating other women (Tr. 32). He explained that because of his hectic work schedule, it was\ndifficult for him to establish long-term relationships with women. The women were unhappy because\nhe was always busy and/or traveling, and they did not stay with him for long. He found it easier to\nsatisfy his sexual needs with prostitutes (Tr. 42). He believed that such behavior was not illegal in\nJapan, and claimed he was not aware it was an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n(UCMJ) (Tr. 41). He testified that the establishment he visited in Japan was located right outside the\ngate of the military base and it was constantly patronized by U.S. servicemen. He never thought too\nmuch about his behavior because he was among many other servicemen who patronized the\nestablishment, and he never heard about any problems related to soliciting and engaging the services\nof prostitutes (Tr. 27-28). \nApplicant claimed he was not aware of the seriousness of soliciting and engaging the services\nof prostitutes in the state of Florida. He believed that such behavior was akin to receiving a speeding\n\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\n4\nperson concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of \u201cthe nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d\n4\nticket for which you have to pay a small fine (Tr. 29). The prostitution establishments in Florida were\nalso close to the military base, and they were frequently visited by military personnel. According to\nApplicant, military police officers as well as state police were always around, and he never heard of\nservicemen getting into trouble for engaging the services of prostitutes. He did not think his behavior\nwas much of a concern to civil or military authorities.\nThe first time Applicant was questioned about his behavior with prostitutes was during his\n2004 polygraph interview. He convincingly stated the last time he solicited and/or engaged the\nservices of a prostitute was in May 2003 (Tr. 36). Applicant claimed his past behavior with\nprostitutes cannot be used against him for several reasons: he has been divorced since 1993, he was\nalways discrete about his actions, and his behavior was infrequent. He believes that not one of his\npast or current supervisors would hold it against him if they were told of his behavior. Applicant\ninformed his current supervisors and his friends (including those who provided him with character\nreference statements) of the reasons behind the government\u2019s security clearance concerns (Tr. 43-\n44). \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse and embarrassment for his past behavior. He promised\nnever to engage in such behavior again. He considers himself to be reliable and trustworthy, and he\nasserts he has good judgment. In support of his assertions, he submitted his military record, and five\ncharacter reference letters from supervisors, co-workers, and friends. Applicant is characterized as\na hard-working person, with exceptional on-duty performance, excellent technical knowledge, and\noutstanding work ethics. In general, his references attest to Applicant\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness,\ngood judgment, and dependability. There is no evidence Applicant has ever mishandled or caused\nthe compromise of classified information while serving on active duty or while employed by a\ndefense contractor.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take\ninto account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each AG applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.4\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline D (Sexual Behavior),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the applicable relevant\nAGs.\n\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n6\nthan a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.5, at 528, 531.\n7\n  See id.; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n5\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it is\n6\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution\n7\nof any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor\nof protecting national security.8\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline D, the government\u2019s concern is that sexual behavior that involves a criminal\noffense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or\nwhich may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. AG \u00b6 12.\nThe government established its case by showing Applicant  solicited and engaged the services\nof prostitutes from July 1993 to February 1994, from May 1996 to May 2000, and in May 2003. His\nbehavior is illegal in the state of Florida. Sexual behavior disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 13(a):\nsexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted; and AG\n\u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior . . . that reflects lack of judgment, apply.\n\n6\nNotwithstanding, considering the evidence as a whole, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nsexual behavior concern. In reaching my decision I specifically considered among other factors,\nApplicant\u2019s credible testimony; his 20 years of honorable service to his country; the fact he has had\naccess to classified information for approximately 24 years with no security violations; Applicant\nwas candid and forthcoming throughout the security clearance process; that it is not likely his\nquestionable behavior could be used as a basis for coercion or exploitation, and that he has not\nengaged in similar conduct for over four years. Sexual behavior mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 14(b):\nthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances,\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; AG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and AG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual,\nand discreet, apply.\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct) the government\u2019s concern is that conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during\nthe security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 15.\nThe government established its case by showing Applicant  solicited and engaged the services\nof prostitutes from July 1993 to February 1994, from May 1996 to May 2000, and in May 2003.\nApplicant\u2019s behavior showed questionable judgment by exposing himself to the risk of acquiring a\nserious venereal disease, and the possibility of criminal prosecution.  Personal Conduct disqualifying\ncondition AG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any\nactivity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States\nand may serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service\nor other group, applies.\nFor the same reasons discussed under Guideline D, I consider Applicant\u2019s behavior under\nGuideline E mitigated by the passage of time, and the other factors outlined in the Guideline D\ndiscussion. Additionally, Applicant disclosed his past questionable behavior to friends and\nsupervisors, thus reducing the possibility of vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nPersonal conduct mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment, and AG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, apply.\nUnder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) the government\u2019s concern is that criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 30.\nThe government established its case by showing Applicant solicited and engaged the services\nof prostitutes from May 1996 to May 2000, and in May 2003. Such behavior was in violation of\nFlorida Statute \u00a7 796.7. Criminal conduct disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a): a single serious\n\n7\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses; and AG \u00b6 31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, apply.\nThere is no evidence Applicant has engaged in similar questionable behavior since May\n2003, or that he has engaged in any other criminal behavior. His honorable military service, as well\nas his job performance while working for government contractors, indicate he has the ability and\nwillingness to comply with laws and regulations. At his hearing, Applicant demonstrated sincere\nremorse. He credibly testified he now realizes the seriousness of his past behavior. He promised not\nto engage in the future in similar behavior. Considering the totality of the circumstances of this\nparticular case, I find Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior is unlikely to recur and it does not cast\ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal conduct mitigating conditions\nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and AG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement, apply.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable AGs. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s credible\ntestimony; his 20 years of honorable service to his country; the fact he has held access to classified\ninformation for approximately 24 years with no security violations; that Applicant was candid and\nforthcoming throughout the security clearance process; his remorse and promise to stay away from\nsimilar behavior; that it is not likely his questionable behavior could be used as a basis for coercion\nor exploitation, and that he has not engaged in similar conduct for over four years. In light of the\ntotality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate all the\nsecurity clearance concerns.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section\nE3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Sexual Behavior\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.d\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Criminal Conduct\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance is granted.\nJuan J. Rivera\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Her \neligibility for a security clearance is denied.  \n \nOn November 6, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On July 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E \nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 13, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 6, 2007, \nMarch 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on December 11, 2007. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on December 17, 2007, and had 30 days from its receipt to file \nobjections and submit additional information. Applicant timely submitted additional \ninformation. On January 28, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to me. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nWithin the FORM, Department Counsel filed a Motion to Amend the SOR to \nchange all references to July 10, 2007 in the subparagraphs concerning debts alleged \nunder Guideline F to November 30, 2006, to conform to the record evidence. Applicant \ndid not file an objection to said Motion. The Motion to Amend is granted.  \n \n \nThe FORM also notes that this is a Co-Subject Case that was processed under \nDISCR Operating Instruction No. 5. The Co-subject is Applicant\u2019s husband. The cases \nwere assigned to the same Department Counsel. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated August 13, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l., and 1.m. She denied the \nremaining allegations under Guideline F. She admitted the allegation under Guideline E.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36 years old, married and has three children. Since September \n2004, she has worked for a defense contractor. Prior to her current position, she worked \nfor private companies, with periods of unemployment between positions. (Item 4). \nPreviously, she submitted a Public Trust Position Application in November 2004. (Item \n8).   \n \n \nIn October 1997, Applicant filed a Petition for Bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. In February 1998, the Bankruptcy Court granted the petition and \ndischarged her debts, the amount of which is not included in this file. \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that eleven debts, totaling approximately $16,094, are more \nthan 180 days delinquent. Applicant admitted owing $13,454 of that amount. She \ndenied owing three medical debts, totaling $983, and asserted that a debt for $1,657 \nwas her husband\u2019s obligation.  \n \n \nIn May 2007, Applicant consulted a credit counselor about her debts, who \nindicated that there were many discrepancies on her credit bureau reports, which he \nwas investigating. None of those discrepancies were disclosed or noted to relate to the \nSOR allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly budget notes a net monthly income of $3,711 and monthly \nexpenses of $2,776. In addition, the budget indicates that she owes $5,047 in financial \nobligations on which she is making monthly payments of $572. She also submitted a list \n\n \n3 \n \n \nof her husband\u2019s financial obligations that totaled $6,567 on which he is making monthly \npayments of $752.  Together, their monthly debt reduction payment is $1,324, leaving a \nmonthly shortage of approximately $400. (Item 5). None of the delinquent debts listed in \nthe SOR are included in those monthly payments, nor is there any evidence \ndocumenting that any of the SOR debts, dating back to 2002, have been paid or \nresolved. (Item 7).          \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n4 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nBehaving responsibility or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship \nwith his creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an \ninability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of \nstrong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant, with a history of serious or \nrecurring financial difficulties, is in a situation of risk inconsistent with the holding of a \nsecurity clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to \nmanage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial obligations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant admitted that she filed a bankruptcy in 1997, indicating that \nher financial problems began prior to 1997. According to the November 2006 credit \nbureau report, Applicant\u2019s subsequent debts began accumulating in 2002. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer \nexamination. \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. Four Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may be \napplicable. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Based on the 1997 bankruptcy \npetition and subsequent accumulation of significant debt, Applicant\u2019s problems cannot \nbe considered isolated; hence, the evidence does not support this potentially mitigating \ncondition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ There is no evidence in \nthe record related to this condition. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not \napplicable. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant submitted a letter from a credit counselor that she contacted \none in May 2007, she did not provide any documentation noting what steps are being \ntaken to address the specific debts listed in the SOR, other than mentioning that there \nare inaccuracies on her credit bureau reports. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to fully \napply AG & 20(c) that requires a showing that she \u201chas received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d  \n \nEvidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(d). \nHowever, Applicant did not provide any evidence that she paid or resolved any of the \neleven debts listed in the SOR.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not \napply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOne Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly relevant in this case. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d may raise a security concern.  Based on Applicant\u2019s admission \n\n \n6 \n \n \nto SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging that she falsified her SF 86 because she failed to disclose debts \nmore than 180 days delinquent, the Government raised this disqualification. \nThe Applicant did not provide any explanation or documentation addressing the \nfalsification allegation. Hence, none of the applicable mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17 apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 36 years old, sufficiently \nmature to be fully responsible for her financial obligations. Additionally, she should have \nhad enough familiarity with the significance of delinquent financial obligations as related \nto the security clearance application, having gone through the process previously. \nAlthough she sought financial counseling in May 2007, she did not present any \nevidence that she addressed the specific delinquent debts listed in the SOR. Until she \nestablishes a budget a plan to manage all of her financial obligations and provides proof \nof a track record of consistent financial management, I am concerned that she will \ncontinue having financial difficulties.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant requested that the case be decided on the\nwritten record.  On April 28, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Thomas M.\nCrean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guidelines\nH and J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nThe Judge found Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of illegal drug use.  From 2001\nto 2002, while serving on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps, Applicant used ecstasy about 13 to\n15  times, marijuana about 50 times, cocaine two times, LSD once, GHB once, and Ketamine once\nor twice.  From 2002 to 2006, Applicant used marijuana about 15 times.  His last use of illegal drugs\noccurred 18 months before the issuance of the decision in his case.  \nWhile in the Marine Corps, Applicant received non-judicial punishment in December 2001\nfor driving under the influence of alcohol.  He was found guilty and was sentenced to 45 days of\nrestriction, 45 days of extra duty, a reduction of one pay grade, and a forfeiture of $900.  Applicant\nwas also court-martialed for violating Article 112(a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for\nusing controlled substances while on active duty with the Marine Corps.  He was sentenced to\nrestriction and a reduction in rank.  In August 2002, he was administratively discharged from the\nMarine Corps with an Other than Honorable Discharge.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record.  As a result,\nthe Judge did not have an opportunity to question him and evaluate his credibility in the context of\na hearing.  However, three fellow workers or supervisors provided letters attesting to Applicant\u2019s\nhonesty and reliability, which the Judge fully considered.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the\nJudge\u2019s findings contain several errors.  Applicant also argues that his prior drug use does not\npresent a problem because his last use, which occurred 18 months prior to the decision, was an\nisolated incident.  Prior to that use, Applicant had not used drugs for four years.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\n\n3\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding \nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620, (1966).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of\nsecurity concern are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable inferences that could be\ndrawn from the record, and are sustainable.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.\n9, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or a party\u2019s ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-26061 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar.\n17, 2008).\nIt is not error to consider an applicant\u2019s past misconduct.  \u201c[T]he security eligibility of an\napplicant cannot be meaningfully assessed by looking only at the applicant\u2019s present situation and\nignoring the applicant\u2019s past conduct.  Such a piecemeal approach is not practical and it would be\ninconsistent with the \u2018whole person\u2019 concept of security clearance determinations.\u201d  See ISCR Case\nNo. 96-0776 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 1997).  In this case, the Judge properly considered the\nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s pattern of conduct as a whole, rather than analyzing each separate\nincident of drug use in a piecemeal fashion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nOct. 20, 2006) citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F. 2d 860 (2  Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events\nnd\nmay have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation).  \nThe Board has examined the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole\nand concludes that the Judge has drawn \u201ca \u2018rational connection between the facts found\u2019\u201d under\nGuidelines H and J and his adverse decision.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United\nStates, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on June 26, 2006. (Gov X 4)  On June 29, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). (Gov X 1)  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 25, 2007.  He admitted all the\nallegations.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. (Gov X 3)\nApril 28, 2008\n\n2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 8,\n2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM), and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or\nmitigate the disqualifying conditions.  He provided additional information on April 2,\n2008.  Department Counsel noted no objection to consideration of the additional\nmaterial on April 4, 2008.  The case was assigned to me on April 17, 2008.  Based upon\na review of the case file and the pleadings, eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under Guidelines H, J, and E.  I\nthoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28 year-old technician for a defense contractor.  Applicant has\nworked for that company for over five years.  He is not married.  He served in the\nMarine Corps from September 1997 until August 2002.  He received an Other than\nHonorable Discharge. (Gov X 4)\nApplicant admitted in an affidavit to security investigators that he used two tablets\nof Ecstasy 13 to 15 times from December 2001 to August 2002 while on active duty in\nthe Marine Corps.  He admitted he used marijuana by smoking it about 50 times from\nDecember 2001 until August 2002 while in the Marine Corps.  He also admitted that\nduring this same time frame, he experimented with LSD one time, twice used cocaine,\nused Ketamine once or twice, and GHB once.   He did not purchase the drugs but\nreceived them from friends.  He also admitted to using marijuana about 15 times from\nOctober 2002 until December 2006. (Gov X 5, at 4-5)\nApplicant noted that he started using illegal drugs after receiving punishment for\ndriving while under the influence of alcohol.  He thought the punishment was unfair and\nhe was tired of being told what to do by his command and he thought the chores given\nhim were a silly form of punishment.  He was at a low point in his life from all of his\ntroubles, and wanted to escape from reality. (Gov X 5, at 4)\nApplicant initially represented to security investigators that he could continue to\nuse marijuana. He explained that he meant that he did not plan to continue to use\nmarijuana but would be around friends who did use the drug.  Since November or\nDecember 2006, he no longer associates with friends who smoke marijuana.  Applicant\nstated he has not sold or cultivated or trafficked in drugs.  He has no financial concerns\nraised by drug use.  He does not feel that his use of drugs would adversely affect his\nlife. (Gov X 5, at 5) \nApplicant admits that while in the Marine Corps he received non-judicial\npunishment in December 2001 for driving under the influence of alcohol.  He was found\nguilty and sentenced to 45 days restriction, 45 days of extra duty, reduced one pay\ngrade, and forfeited $900.  He also admitted he used illegal drugs in violation of the\n\n3\nUniform Code of Military Justice from December 2001 until August 2002.  He was court-\nmartialed for violating Article 112(a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for using\ncontrolled substances while on active duty with the Marine Corps.  He received\nrestriction, and a reduction in rank.  In August 2002, he was administratively discharged\nfrom the Marine Corps with an Other than Honorable Discharge. (Gov Xs 4 and 5)\nApplicant notes that since his discharge from the Marine Corps, he has worked\nfor his employer delivering services to the Marine Corps.  He has over ten years\nexperience with Marine Corps Air Traffic Control systems, and has been entrusted with\nsensitive material and documentation.  He works hard and is an honest and reliable\nemployee.  He looks back on the incidents in the Marine Corps as things he wishes he\nnever did.  \nThree of his fellow workers or supervisors provided letters attesting to his\nhonesty and reliability.  The lead electronic technician stated Applicant performs a\nvariety of duties in electronics and electromechanical areas.  He can be relied on to\naccomplish assigned tasks in a competent manner without supervision.   A fellow\ntechnician notes that he has worked with Applicant for over five years.  Applicant is\nentrusted with confidential information and documentation and he handles his\nresponsibilities effectively.  He considers Applicant as an outstanding gentleman and a\npleasure to work with.  His immediate supervisor notes Applicant is a very competent\ntechnician who has traveled to Department of Defense sites to provide technical\nassistance to military units.  He has proven he can accomplish all assigned tasks with a\nhigh degree of proficiency and he highly recommends him. (Response to FORM, dated\nApril 3, 2008)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to\nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nmadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering\nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  All of\nthe drugs Applicant used are listed in the Act.  Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or\nthe use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction. (AG\n\u00b6 24) \nApplicant\u2019s admitted to using six different controlled substances from December\n2001 until August 2002 while he served on active duty in the Marine Corps.  He also\nadmitted to continued use of marijuana from October 2002 until December 2006.  His\ndrug use raises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use),\nand AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution).  \nI have considered the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions and find none\napply.  Applicant admitted using a variety of drugs and his last admitted use of an illegal\ndrug was about 18 months ago which makes his use recent and frequent, therefore AG\n\u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.\nApplicant notes that since November or December 2006, he has not used illegal drugs\n\n5\nand no longer associates with those that use drugs.  He is a reliable worker for his\nemployer and his supervisors and fellow workers have trust in his judgment.  This\nclearly shows his demonstrated intent to stop using marijuana.  However, this stated\nintent is only recent as opposed to his many years of drug use.  AG \u00b6 26(b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where\ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of\nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation) applies in part since he\nhas demonstrated an intent not to use drugs but the intent is only recent.  He has not\npresented sufficient information to overcome the security concern for his use of illegal\ndrugs.  Guideline H is decided against Applicant\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30)    Applicant received non-judicial\npunishment while on active duty with the Marine Corps.  He also admitted to using\nillegal drugs while on active duty, as well as a number of years until December 2006.\nHis use of illegal drugs violated both military and civilian criminal law.  His conduct\nraises Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses), and CD DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted).\nApplicant raised Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) \u00b6 32 (a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and CC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement).  Initially,\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred while he was on active duty with the Marine\nCorps.  However, he continued to use illegal drugs so he continued to violate criminal\nlaw.  His last admitted use was about 18 months ago.  He willingly used drugs, so his\nuse was not under unusual circumstances.  His recent willing use of illegal drugs casts\ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.   There is some evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation in that Applicant has worked for his employer for about five\nyears and has been a successful employee.  He voiced his desire not to use illegal\ndrugs again.  However, since his criminal conduct was recent and willing, Applicant has\nnot presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for his criminal\nconduct.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\n\n6\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern\nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence\nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  \nApplicant was court-martialed while on active duty with the Marine Corps for use\nof illegal drugs.  He was administratively separated from the Marine Corps with an Other\nthan Honorable Discharge, the lowest administrative discharge that can be given.  His\nsecurity clearance was revoked when it was alleged he used illegal drugs.  This\ninformation raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct,\nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. . .)  \nApplicant raised by his responses to the SOR and the FORM Personal Conduct\nMitigating Conditions (PC MC) \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce\nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.)  Applicant has\nstopped using illegal drugs.  His employer and his fellow workers know of his past\ntroubles and poor conduct in the Marine Corps and his use of drugs.  They know that\nhis security clearance has been revoked in the past for drug use.  Since Appellant has\nacknowledged his past poor conduct and activities, he has taken steps to reduce and\neliminate the negative impact of the activities.  I find for Applicant as to Personal\nConduct.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the\nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommons sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole person concept.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s over five years of good service with his employer and his\ncontribution to the mission of his employer.  I considered his candor in providing\nadverse information concerning his own misconduct.  I considered his criminal conduct\nduring his active duty tour with the Marine Corps and that he has not had any criminal\nconduct since December 2006.  I also considered his actions in driving while intoxicated\nand using illegal drugs.  I considered that his tour with the Marine Corps was terminated\nunder Other than Honorable Conditions.  Applicant has not established that he is\n\n7\ntrustworthy, reliable, and exercises good judgment.  Overall, the record evidence leaves\nme with questions about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement, criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a to 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n_________________\nTHOMAS M. CREAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by adjudicating\nApplicant\u2019s case; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary\nto law.\n(1) On appeal, Applicant states that after Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterial to her, she and her security officer verbally informed Department Counsel that Applicant\ndid not need a security clearance for her position and later faxed him a letter to that effect.\nTherefore, the Appeal Board construes Applicant\u2019s brief as contending that the Judge should not\nhave issued a decision in her case.\nThe Board does not have authority to determine whether a position does or does not require\na security clearance.  Of course, a claim that a case should not go forward because of lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction can be raised at any time during the proceedings, including for the first time on\nappeal.  Here, however, Applicant stops short of asserting that her security clearance application had\nbeen withdrawn.  She merely asserts that a communication was made to DOHA Department Counsel\nindicating that she did not need a clearance for the position that she was performing at the time.\nSuch a representation does not equate to a claim that the security clearance application has been\nwithdrawn, since such applications are sometimes filed in anticipation of a prospective need.  There\nis nothing in the case file to indicate that Applicant\u2019s company had withdrawn its request for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  Nor did Applicant attach a copy of any such documentation with\nher appeal.   Therefore, even after making allowances for her pro se status, Applicant has not met\n1\nher burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in continuing to process her case.\n  \n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the\nJudge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that her\nindebtedness had resulted from circumstances beyond her control (underemployment and the lack\nof health insurance), that she had acted responsibly under the circumstances and made a good faith\neffort to repay her overdue creditors, and that there are now clear indications that her financial\nproblems are under control.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant as to SOR paragraphs 1(c), 1(l), 1(ae), and 1(af).  Those favorable\n2\nfindings are not at issue on appeal.\n3\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still owed approximately $13,359 on 28\ndelinquent debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3,\n2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to some of the SOR allegations.2\nHowever, he reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at\n2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined\nthe relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 18,\n2005. On July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\n1\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 15, 2007. Although not\nexplicitly stated in the response, the assigned Personnel Security Specialist and\nDepartment Counsel reported that she requested that her case be decided by an\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\nSee  AJ Exhibit I (documents pertaining to Applicant\u2019s election of administrative determination).\n2\nThe government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4.\n4\nItem 5 at 4.\n5\nItem 3, Encl. 1.\n6\n2\nAdministrative Judge on the written record without a hearing.  Department Counsel\n2\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on October 25, 2007.  A complete copy of the\nfile of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an\n3\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM on\nNovember 5, 2007, and returned it to DOHA. She provided no further response to the\nFORM within the 30-day period she was given to do so, did not request additional time\nto respond, and made no objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by\nDepartment Counsel. I received the case assignment on January 15, 2008. Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor with no prior military\nservice. She was divorced in October 2002. In the General Remarks section (question\n43) of her SF 86, she stated that she is a single parent of one or more children.\nHowever, no children were listed in response to question 9 on her SF 86, so further\ndetail is unavailable. She has been continuously employed since 1997, except for one\nmonth of unemployment in February 2003.  Her personal financial statement, dated\n4\nJune 4, 2007, reflects about $630 in monthly surplus of family income over expenses.5\nIn her answer to the SOR, dated October 15, 2007, and her sworn answers to\nfinancial interrogatories, dated June 4, 2007, Applicant admitted the truth of all factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.af of the SOR, with explanations. Her admissions are,\nwith the exceptions noted below, corroborated by the credit bureau reports (CBR) in\nItems 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the FORM, and are incorporated herein as findings of fact. For\nease of comprehension, the 32 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR will be broken into\nthree groups involving judgment, medical, and consumer debt allegations. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.ae and 1 af allege six judgment debts totaling $4,701.\nApplicant correctly noted, in her response to the SOR, that the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 1.ae are the same judgment debt, originally in the alleged amount of $225. She\nsubmitted proof of one $20 payment to the collection agency to whom the debt was\nassigned.  This receipt also shows the collection agency now claims an outstanding\n6\nbalance of $575.05 on this debt, after the $20 payment. Applicant also correctly\nresponded that the $371 judgment debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.af are the same, but\n\nItem 5, Equidata CBR, dated May 18, 2007, at page 10 of 16.  \n7\nThis figure values the \u00b6 1.a debt at the SOR-alleged $225, rather than the $575 now claimed by the\n8\ncollection agency.\nItem 3, Encl. 2. \n9\nSee Item 7 at 1; Item 8 at 2. The amounts alleged, $235 and $79, respectively, are correct, and their mis-\n10\ndesignation as medical accounts in the SOR is not considered a fatal variance.\nItem 3, Encl. 3; Item 8 at 2. Applicant provided no proof of her claim that she had made arrangements to\n11\npay $10 per month toward this debt beginning in November 2007. \nItem 3 at 1, Encl. 4.\n12\nCompare Item 3, Encl. 4, with Item 8 at 3 (debt reported delinquent as of June 2006).\n13\n3\nclaimed that she could not contact the creditor. In fact, the CBR she submitted with her\nresponse to financial interrogatories shows that this judgment debt was paid on\nDecember 1, 2005.  Accordingly, Applicant owes three judgment debts, as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6\n7\n1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, in the total amount of $3,701.  \n8\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.y allege 21 medical bills in collections, totaling $4,131.\nApplicant admitted to all of them, claiming they were consolidated in a repayment\nprogram and some had been paid. She submitted an account statement and several\n\u201cpaid-in-full\u201d receipts for medical bills paid under this program.  The first receipt\n9\ncorresponds to the $50 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l, but none of the other receipts\ncorrespond to debts alleged in the SOR. Contrary to the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and\n1.s, and Applicant\u2019s admissions thereto, those debts are for telephone bills to two\ndifferent companies as opposed to medical accounts.  Accordingly, their total of $314\n10\nwill be subtracted from the medical group and added to the consumer debt category\nbelow. Applicant owes 18 delinquent medical debts, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through\n1.k, 1.m through 1.q, and 1.t through 1.y, in the total amount of $3,767.\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.z through 1.ad allege five credit card and consumer-credit debts that\nare charged off or in collections, totaling $5,577. Applicant admitted owing them. She\nsubmitted a collection agency\u2019s offer, dated September 5, 2007, to settle the \u00b6 1.z debt\nfor a lesser amount. She provided no proof of any payment toward this offer, the\npayment coupon that was to accompany payment remained attached to the copy of the\noffer letter, and the debt remained unpaid on her October 25, 2007 CBR.  Appellant\n11\nclaimed to have negotiated a reduced settlement for the $920 debt alleged in \u00b6 1.aa,\nand submitted a collection agency\u2019s settlement offer letter.  This offer actually involved\n12\na different and more recent delinquent credit card debt to a different bank that was not\nincluded in the SOR.  There is no evidence of resolution of the alleged debt. In\n13\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant claimed (without documentation) to have made\narrangements to start repaying the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.ab, and 1.ac, at $10 per month\n\nItem 3 at 1.\n14\nItem 5 at 7.\n15\nItem 5, Equidata CBR, dated May 18, 2007, at pages 3 of 16, and 5 of 16.\n16\n4\neach starting in November and December 2007.  In her June 4, 2007, response to\n14\ninterrogatories, she said she had arranged to start payments on these two debts at the\nend of that month.  She provided no proof of any payment toward either debt. Finally,\n15\nApplicant claimed that the $1,468 debt alleged in \u00b6 ad was the same as the debt alleged\nin \u00b6 1.z. This is incorrect, since the latter debt is for a bank-issued credit card and the\nformer is owed to a collection agency for a fitness center.  Applicant owes these five\n16\ncredit card and consumer-credit debts in the total amount of $5,577 as alleged.\nIncluding the $314 in telephone account debts, improperly alleged as medical debts\nabove, the total of her seven non-judgment and non-medical debts is $5,891.\nCombining these three groups produces a total of 28 delinquent debts still\noutstanding, in the amount of $13,359, toward which Applicant provided no evidence of\npayment or other resolution. The record CBRs reflect that some of these debts first\nbecame delinquent in every year since 1999, with no evidence of any single\nprecipitating event. Applicant provided no other evidence of good character,\ntrustworthiness or judgment in mitigation. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under\nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant number and amount of\ndelinquent debts over the past eight years. She was either unable or unwilling to repay\nthese debts, despite submitting a personal financial statement reflecting an apparent\nability to do so. Excluding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.l, which were paid,\nApplicant demonstrated no effort to resolve any of the remaining $13,359 of proven\ndelinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination and balancing of resulting security concerns\nwith any potentially mitigating matters.\n\n6\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial\nissues have been a continuing problem since at least 1999. Her disregard of these\nfinancial obligations is ongoing, and continues to raise concerns about her current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence does not support this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquencies arose on a regular basis, with new delinquent debt reported in every year\nsince 1999. These delinquencies preceded and followed her 2002 divorce, with no\nevidence of recent responsible action to address them. Although 18 of the 28 debts\ninvolved medical bills, these only involved 28% ($3,767 out of $13,359) of the amount\npast due. This potentially mitigating condition is not supported as a factor for significant\nconsideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant neither asserted nor provided evidence of either of\nthese conditions, except with respect to the $371 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c (which she\ndid not even realize was reported as being paid), and the $50 debt alleged in \u00b6 1.l,\nwhich she paid. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nApplicant reported surplus monthly income, yet regularly incurs delinquent debt.\nShe has made minimal effort to address or resolve the delinquent debts established by\nthe Government, even after receiving notice of the security concerns raised by these\nissues. This supports the inference that she remains financially overextended and,\ntherefore, at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. It further indicates\na lack of judgment and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, thereby raising\nsubstantial questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard\nclassified information.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\n\n7\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for her choices and conduct. She provided no information to show that\nany of these debts arose due to circumstances largely beyond her control. Applicant\nhas been employed almost continuously throughout the period that these debts became\ndelinquent, and reports having the means to begin resolving these delinquent debts\nshould she choose to do so. She has chosen not to resolve them without valid\njustification. There is no evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral change. She\nsubmitted no evidence demonstrating that risk of coercion or duress is not significant\nHer ongoing disregard of lawful obligations, especially after receiving notice of the\nsecurity concerns raised thereby, creates continuing doubt about her trustworthiness\nand reliability. She offered no other evidence to mitigate these concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ab:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ac:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ad:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ae:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.af:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, and denied all remaining allegations with explanation. Applicant is a 35-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. From November 2007 to November 2008, she worked in Iraq as a system administrator for a contractor. On November 11, 2008, she started a new job with another contractor as a desk top engineer. She has approximately two years college credit. She has been separated from her husband since September 2006 and is in the process of filing for divorce. She has a 16-year-old son from a previous relationship. (Tr at 4-7, 27-28, 37, 51; Gov 1; AE C at 13-17, 23-26.) On June 8, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application when she was employed with a previous defense contractor. (Gov 1.) The security clearance application apparently was transferred to her subsequent employers. Applicant testified that Government Exhibit 1 was the most recent security clearance application submitted by her. (Tr at 44.) A subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2007. Her debts were discharged in August 2007.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86 (SF 86) \non June 8, 2005. On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 25, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 2, 2008. Applicant \nwas deployed out of the country. A hearing date was arranged upon her return. On \nOctober 20, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nNovember 6, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered four \nexhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4 without objection. The \nApplicant testified and offered two exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits \nDecember 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n(AE) A \u2013 B without objection. The record was held open until November 20, 2008, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional evidence. On November 17, 2008, Applicant \nrequested an extension to submit documents. The extension was granted until \nDecember 11, 2008. Applicant timely submitted a 26-page document that was admitted \nas AE C without objection. The transcript was received on November 24, 2008. Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, and denied all \nremaining allegations with explanation.   \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance. From November 2007 to November 2008, she worked in \nIraq as a system administrator for a contractor. On November 11, 2008, she started a \nnew job with another contractor as a desk top engineer. She has approximately two \nyears college credit. She has been separated from her husband since September 2006 \nand is in the process of filing for divorce. She has a 16-year-old son from a previous \nrelationship. (Tr at 4-7, 27-28, 37, 51; Gov 1; AE C at 13-17, 23-26.)  \n \nOn June 8, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application when she \nwas employed with a previous defense contractor. (Gov 1.) The security clearance \napplication apparently was transferred to her subsequent employers. Applicant testified \nthat Government Exhibit 1 was the most recent security clearance application submitted \nby her. (Tr at 44.) A subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2007. Her debts were discharged in August 2007. \nHer credit reports listed six delinquent accounts, with a total approximate balance of \n$15,762. Of that amount, $13,329 was a delinquent student loan account. (Gov 2; Gov \n4.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent accounts include: a $140 account placed for collection in \nAugust 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 2); a $325 medical account placed for collection in \nFebruary 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 2); a $150 medical account placed for collection in \nFebruary 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 2); a $13,329 delinquent student loan account \nplaced for collection in April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 2); a $638 delinquent account \nplaced for collection in August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 2); and a $1,180 delinquent \ncell phone account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \nIn 2005, Applicant and her husband started a moving company because her \nhusband was unable to find a job.  Her husband eventually stopped making an effort to \nmake the company successful which resulted in their marital separation in September \n2006. Employees stole from the company which further contributed to the company\u2019s \nproblems. (Tr at 25-27.)  Applicant tried to keep the company in business by herself \nafter they separated. She also had a full-time job. She was unable to pay the bills and \nlost her full-time job in June 2006. (Tr at 39-40.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nOn May 16, 2007, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Her attorney advised \nher to file for Chapter 7 because all of the business accounts were in her name.  She \nclaimed total assets of $51,808 and total liabilities of $81,890.23.  She attended credit \ncounseling as part of a requirement for filing the bankruptcy petition. On August 29, \n2007, her dischargeable debts were discharged. (Tr at 29-36; Gov 3.)  \n \nApplicant was unemployed from July 2006 to January 2007. She worked a six-\nmonth temporary position from January 2007 to June 2007. She was unemployed from \nJuly 2007 to November 2007 until she was hired for the one-year term position in Iraq. \n(Tr at 51-52.) \n \nApplicant earned approximately $6,000 in take home pay during the year she \nwas in Iraq.  She was able to pay most of her debts because she had approximately \n$1,500 left over each month after expenses. She will earn approximately $27 an hour in \nher new job. (Tr at 45-47.)  \n \nThe status of the debts in the SOR are: \n \n1.b:  $140 collection account, paid off. (Tr at 41-42; AE B at 3; AE C at 21.) \n \n1.c: $325 medical account, claims paid April 2008. (Tr at 22, 25.) This debt is not \nlisted on Applicant\u2019s current credit report. (AE B.) Several medical accounts were listed \non Schedule F of Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. This debt was either paid or \ndischarged in bankruptcy. (Gov 3, Schedule F.)  \n \n1.d: $150 medical account, claims paid April 2008. (Tr at 22, 25; AE B at 9.) \nSeveral medical accounts were listed on Schedule F of Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filing. This debt was either paid or discharged in bankruptcy. (Gov 3, \nSchedule F.)  \n \n1.e: $13,329 delinquent student loan has been rehabilitated. The loan is no \nlonger in default. She has an agreement to pay $200 a month towards the loan and is \ncurrent on her payments. (Tr at 22; AE A; AE C at 5-7, 10-12.)  \n \n1.f: $638 collection account, resolved and/or paid. The most recent credit report \nlists the balance on the account as $1. It also indicates Applicant disputed the account. \n(Tr at 44; AE B at 18; AE C at 11.) \n \n1.g: $1,180 cell phone account placed for collection. Applicant states this account \nis not hers. She disputed to account and it was removed from her credit report.  This \naccount is not listed on any of the credit reports that are in the record. The government \ndid not establish that this is a valid debt. (Tr at 21-22; Gov 2; Gov 4; AE B.) \n \nApplicant is in the process of filing her tax returns for this year and the past year. \nShe did not receive W-2s from the companies she worked for in 2007 before going to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIraq. She anticipates a refund. (Tr at 50-51.) Applicant was under the mistaken belief \nthat taxpayers only had to file tax returns every three years unless they owe taxes. (Tr \nat 60-61.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s site manager in Iraq wrote a letter of recommendation on her behalf. \nHe states that she did an excellent job while mentoring others. She was responsible for \nsystems support and provided countless hours of support to ensure the Department of \nDefense networks remained functional at all times. She was always willing to go above \nand beyond what was required of her. (AE C at 3.) Applicant received two Letters of \nAppreciation during her tenure in Iraq. (AE C at 1-2.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) & 19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC & 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant incurred a significant amount \nof business-related and personal debt, which resulting in her filing for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in May 2007.  She was unable to pay her student loans which went into \ndefault.  \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems were the result of a failed business and the breakup of her marriage \nin 2006. Her current financial condition is stable.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies for the reasons mentioned in the \nabove paragraph. The moving business Applicant and her husband started in 2005 \n\n \n6 \n \n \nultimately went out of business in late 2006/2007. The debts from the business and her \nmarital separation in September 2006 made it difficult for Applicant to pay her business \nand personal debts. Her financial conditions were further complicated by the loss of her \nfull-time job in June 2006.  Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nBankruptcy is a legitimate way to resolve one\u2019s debts. She rehabilitated her student \nloans and is paying on them. The other accounts are resolved. \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does applies. Applicant demonstrated that she has control over her finances. \nThe one concern raised at hearing is her failure to file her income tax returns last year. \nShe misunderstood her duty to file her federal income tax returns on annual basis. \nHowever, she worked in Iraq over the past year and is in the process of filing her taxes. \nHer current financial situation is stable.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant had a good basis for filing for \nbankruptcy. Her financial problems were not the result of living beyond her means. \nBankruptcy is a legitimate way of resolving one\u2019s debts. She rehabilitated her student \nloans and is current on her monthly student loan payments. The other debts alleged in \nthe SOR were minimal (total balance $1,253) and have been resolved.  \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nreferences related to her year of working in Iraq. I considered her efforts to resolve her \nfinancial situation.  I considered that her financial problems were the result of a failed \nbusiness, a failed marriage, and several periods of unemployment. Her current financial \nsituation is stable. Applicant has mitigated the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 28-year-old analyst for a defense contractor.  She had four incidents with\nalcohol within a two year period when she was a minor.  Afterward, she attended and graduated from\ncollege, and had no alcohol-related incidents for over six years.  She then had a driving while\nintoxicated incident in 2006 that has not yet been resolved by court action.  She acknowledges her\nmistake of drinking alcohol and then driving in 2006.  In spite of the latest alcohol-related incident,\nshe demonstrated that she does not currently consume alcohol to such an excess as to create an\nalcohol consumption security concern.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\n\nItem 4.\n1\nSee Response to FORM, dated September 3, 2007.\n2\nItems 1 and 3.\n3\n2\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the\nnew Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\nby the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR\non July 9, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nthe Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 25, 2007.  She admitted five and denied one\nof the allegations under Guideline G, and provided some explanation for her actions.  She elected\nto have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 7, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM), and was provided the opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  She\nprovided additional information in her response to the FORM on September 3, 2007.  Department\ncounsel, on September 17, 2007, noted no objection to consideration of the additional information.\nThe case was assigned to me on September 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI thoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old analyst for a defense contractor.  She is single.  She started college\nin 2001 receiving a bachelor of arts degree in 2005.  As part of her employment with the defense\ncontractor, Applicant submitted a security clearance application on June 16, 2005.1\nApplicant admits that in April 2000, when she was six months shy of her 21  birthday, she\nst\nwas involved in an automobile accident and arrested for driving under the influence (underage).  She\nplead guilty, was fined $100, and ordered to perform community service.  Applicant noted that she\nwas not intoxicated at the time since her blood alcohol level was only .03.  She was charged with\ndriving under the influence because she was under the lawful age to drink alcohol and was driving\nafter drinking alcohol.

She denies drinking every weekend to the point of\nintoxication.  There is no information in the case file to establish that Applicant drinks every week-\nend to the point of intoxication.4\nApplicant attributes her alcohol problems to youthful indiscretions and poor family life.\nExcept for the incident in 2006, she was underage for drinking alcohol when all of the other\nincidents took place.  Her parents were alcohol and drug abusers, and her father spent time in prison.\nShe was mostly raised in church sponsored homes.  She admits that when she graduated from high\nschool, she drank alcohol to excess.  She learned how alcohol affected her life, refrained from\ndrinking alcohol to excess for over six years, and completed college.  Her arrest for driving under\nthe influence of alcohol in July 2006 after an automobile accident was a mistake, and  she stated she\nwill learn from that mistake.5\nApplicant is highly rated as an employee by her defense contractor employer.  She has been\nrated as an essential member of the contractor\u2019s team, an asset to the organization, and a pleasure\nto work with.  She has also maintained a good credit score and does not have financial problems.6\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n7\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.8\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2, amended by the new Administrative Guidelines, of the Directive sets forth the standards\nfor determining eligibility for access to classified information, listing the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions to be considered for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair,\nimpartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances,\nas well as the whole person concept.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.

An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\nrecurrence.9\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n10\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\nmay disqualify the Applicant from access to classified information.   Applicant is responsible for\n11\npresenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\n12\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nsecurity clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any mitigating\n13\ncondition.  Administrative Judges cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is\napplicable because the government does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating\ncondition.   \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct\n14\nunder any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to\n15\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d16\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n\nAG \u00b6 21.\n17\n5\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.   Applicant\u2019s arrests for minor in possession of alcohol, and for driving under the\n17\ninfluence of alcohol raises Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and AC DC \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).  Applicant was a minor when she was arrested three times for\npossession of alcohol and once for driving as a minor after drinking alcohol in a two-year time (April\n1998 to April 2000).  She admits she was drinking alcohol excessively during this time.  Four arrests\nin that time frame shows she was habitually drinking alcohol sometimes to the point of impairment.\nSecurity concerns for excess alcohol consumption can be mitigated under Alcohol\nConsumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (So much times has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and AC MC \u00b6\n23(b) (The individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome ths problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (of an alcohol abuser).  Applicant acknowledges that in her\nyouth, she abused alcohol.  She matured and attended college and earned her degree.  From 2000 until\n2006, while a college student and after starting to work, she did not have an alcohol-related incident.\nHowever, she was arrested in 2006 for driving under the influence.  While the court action for this\noffense has not been completed, she acknowledges that she did drive while intoxicated.  She realizes\nher mistake and acknowledged her vow not to have it happen again.  The security concern is for excess\nalcohol consumption that leads to questionable judgment resulting in concerns for reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  The absence of any alcohol-related incidents for over six years while Applicant\nattended college and matured followed by one incident of alcohol abuse does not cast doubt on her\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.  She showed responsible use of alcohol, if not\nabstinence, for over six years, and has overcome her youthful problem with alcohol.  The latest\nincident with alcohol does not show she now consumes alcohol to such an extent as to create a security\nconcern.  I find Applicant mitigated security concerns for alcohol consumption.\nI have considered all of the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness.  I considered Applicant\u2019s candor and honesty in her self-evaluation of her use of alcohol.\nShe did not abuse alcohol for over six years and earned a college degree.  She understands the\nproblems associated with alcohol abuse.  The absence of alcohol abuse for over six years, even\nconsidered in conjunction with the recent one-time use of alcohol to excess by driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol, shows that her present alcohol consumption is not excessive and does not create\na security concern.  I conclude she is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\n\n6\nby section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Nazareth, Jr., Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SF 86) on January 23,\n2003. On August 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 28, 2007. With the\nassistance of his legal counsel, he answered the SOR in writing on September 7, 2007.\nOn September 10, 2007, Applicant forwarded his Answer to DOHA and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non October 30, 2007. On November 8, 2007, I received the case assignment, and on\nDecember 6, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for January 22, 2008.\nMarch 11, 2008\n\n2\nI convened the hearing on January 22, 2008, as scheduled. Six Government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-6) and three Applicant exhibits (A-C) were received into evidence without\nobjection and Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by\nDOHA on February 5, 2008. At Applicant\u2019s request, the record was held open until\nFebruary 25, 2008, for him to submit medical records. On February 20, 2008,  Applicant\nforwarded statements from an employee assistance program (EAP) clinician and from\nhis physician, which were admitted as Exhibits D and E respectively. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nFollowing the taking of evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR\nby adding \u00b6 1.p under Guideline J, alleging that Applicant was arrested in approximately\nApril 2007 for disorderly conduct, for which he was sentenced to community service,\nand furthermore, to cross-reference the arrests set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a through \u00b6 1.m\nand \u00b6 1.o through \u00b6 1.p under a new Guideline G. The motion was based on Applicant\u2019s\nhearing testimony. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object and the SOR was amended. In\naccord with \u00b6 E3.1.17, Applicant was granted two weeks to file documents in response.\nHe forwarded exhibits D and E on February 20, 2008. Department Counsel did not\nobject to their admissibility and they were accepted into the record as full exhibits.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, that\nApplicant was arrested 16 times between September 1978 and April 2007 for various\noffenses (operating under the influence of liquor, disorderly person, shoplifting, battery,\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon, restraining order violation, harassing\ntelephone calls, threatening, malicious destruction of property, domestic simple assault,\ndomestic disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana). Applicant was alleged to have\nbeen convicted of several of the charges: November 1984 disorderly person (SOR \u00b6\n1.f); August 1987 restraining order violation, harassing telephone calls, and malicious\ndestruction of property (SOR \u00b6 1.g); November 1987 threatening and malicious\ndestruction of property (SOR \u00b6 1.h); late November 1987 assault and battery with a\ndangerous weapon and threatening (two counts) and January 1989 probation violation\n(SOR \u00b6 1.i); June 1988 threatening and March 1989 warrant for probation violation\n(SOR \u00b6 1.j); June 2002 domestic simple assault/battery and domestic disorderly\nconduct (SOR \u00b6 1.n); January 2006 possession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.o); and about\nApril 2007 disorderly person (SOR \u00b6 1.p). DOHA alleged under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 2.a)\nthat alcohol was a factor in all the offenses but the 2002 simple assault and disorderly\nconduct (SOR \u00b6 1.n).\nApplicant admitted the arrests and dispositions as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through\n1.n, but indicated that others were at times culpable in some way (SOR \u00b6 1.c, 1983\n\n3\nshoplifting\u2014friend told him the beer was paid for; SOR \u00b6 1.d, 1983 battery and\ndisorderly conduct\u2014cab driver verbally aggressive; SOR \u00b6 1.f, 1984 disorderly\nperson\u2014friend had verbal confrontation with police officer; SOR \u00b6 1.g, 1987 restraining\norder violation, harassing telephone calls, malicious destruction of property and SOR \u00b6\n1.h, threatening and malicious destruction of property\u2014ex-girlfriend consistently\nharassed him; SOR \u00b6 1.i, 1987 assault and battery and threatening\u2014theft of alcohol\nfrom his home; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m threatening and abuse prevention act\u2014ex-wife\nconsistently filed complaints). Applicant attributed the June 1988 incident (SOR \u00b6 1.j) to\nhis abuse of alcohol, after which he received treatment and maintained sobriety until\nJuly 2002 (\u00b6 1.n). Applicant denied the disposition for the January 2006 marijuana\npossession charge (SOR \u00b6 1.o), but volunteered that he had been arrested for\ndisorderly in April or May 2007 (amended SOR \u00b6 1.p). Applicant admitted that alcohol\nwas involved in all the offenses but for SOR \u00b6 1.n. After consideration of the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old shipfitter in a defense contractor\u2019s apprenticeship\nprogram. He has worked for the company since February 2003, with the exception of a\nbrief layoff from October 2006 to April 2007 (Tr. 36-37). He seeks to retain his security\nclearance (Tr. 48).\nAt age 19, Applicant was arrested for operating under the influence of liquor in\nSeptember 1978. He had consumed a few beers before his arrest and failed field\nsobriety tests. The case was continued without a finding to late December 1979. On his\nsuccessful completion of a drunk driving education program the charge was dismissed.\nApplicant denies he was intoxicated on that occasion but admits he felt \u201cbuzzed.\u201d (Tr.\n49-51)\nApplicant continued to drink alcohol. In February 1980, he married his first wife\n(Ex. 1). In January 1981, Applicant was arrested for disorderly person. Applicant does\nnot recall the circumstances, but is sure he was intoxicated on that occasion (Tr. 53).\nThe charge was continued without a finding until August 1981 and then dismissed. (Tr.\n50-51)\nIn August 1983, Applicant was charged with shoplifting after he attempted to\nleave a convenience store with a case of beer. His companion had told him that it was\npaid for. Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the time (\u201ckind of two sheets\nthat day,\u201d Tr. 54), and did not check with a cashier before leaving the premises.\nAdjudication was withheld. (Ex. 6, Tr. 53-55)\nApplicant got into an altercation with a cab driver after drinking at an American\nLegion hall in September 1983. He recalls only that the cab driver became verbally\naggressive when he cancelled the cab, and that he walked away after an argument.\nApplicant was charged with misdemeanor battery and with disorderly conduct. The\ncharges were later dismissed. (Ex. 6, Tr. 55-58)\n\n4\nThe Government alleged, and Applicant admitted that he was arrested in April\n1984 for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Applicant was found not guilty of\nthe offense, and the Government presented no evidence of culpability. Applicant\nbelieves he may have gotten into a fight with a friend but does not recall the specifics.\n(Tr. 59-60)\nIn late November 1984, Applicant and a companion were refused entry into a\nlocal nightclub. A verbal confrontation between the doorman and his companion\nfollowed, and Applicant was arrested for disorderly person after he refused to leave the\npremises when asked to do so. He was sentenced to two months in jail, suspended for\none year, and he was placed on supervised probation. The charge was eventually\ndismissed after he completed the terms of his sentence. (Tr. 61-65) Applicant does not\nrecall how much he had to drink that night but he is certain he was intoxicated (Tr. 62).\nAfter Applicant and his first wife separated (they were divorced in September\n1986), Applicant entered into a cohabitant relationship with his then girlfriend that turned\nsour (Tr. 66-67). Applicant was arrested twice in 1987 for threatening and/or\nharassment. In early August 1987, Applicant was arrested for violating a restraining\norder that his girlfriend had obtained, for harassing telephone calls, and for malicious\ndestruction of property. He was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to three\nmonths in jail, suspended to January 1990 (Tr. 66-67). In early November 1987,\nApplicant was charged with threatening and malicious destruction of property. He was\nfound guilty of both charges which were filed, although Applicant indicated in his answer\nthat his ex-girlfriend had \u201cconsistently harassed [him] after breaking up.\u201d (Answer, Tr.\n67)\nOn their divorce, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was granted custody of their two children.\nThe children were subsequently removed from her home by the department of social\nservices and after working with social services for about a year, Applicant gained\ncustody. (Tr. 78-80)\nIn late November 1987, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery with a\ndangerous weapon and threatening (two counts) after he confronted his teenage\nbabysitter over suspected theft of alcohol from his home. Applicant was drunk at the\ntime, and he got into a physical altercation with his babysitter\u2019s brother. He was\nconvicted of all three counts and sentenced on the assault charge to three months in\njail, suspended to January 1990, and ordered to make restitution. The other charges\nwere filed. In January 1989, he was committed to the house of corrections for three\nmonths for violation of probation following another arrest. (Tr. 69-73)\nIn late June 1988, Applicant was involved in a bar room fight. He had a knife on\nhim at the time and was arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and\nwith threatening (Ex. 6, Tr. 74-75). He was found guilty of the threatening charge,\nplaced on probation for one year, and ordered to pay court costs. Applicant was\ncommitted to an addiction treatment facility for 30 days after his arrest (Tr. 75-76). In\n\n5\nearly March 1989, a warrant was issued for violation of his probation. He was sentenced\nto 60 days, suspended to July 1989, and his case was continued (Answer, Tr. 76).\nIn mid-March 1989, Applicant was charged with threatening on complaint of his\nex-wife. Their divorce had not been amicable and he made \u201ca lot of phone calls\u201d as they\nargued over the children (Tr. 78-79). Two weeks later, Applicant was charged with\nviolation of abuse prevention act. The threatening and abuse prevention act violation\ncharges were both continued to June 21, 1989, and then dismissed. Applicant had been\ndrinking before his arrest (Tr. 81).\nApplicant married his second wife in May 1989 (Ex. 1). Following another\ncomplaint by his ex-wife, Applicant was charged with threatening in October 1989. A\ndefault warrant was issued. Applicant is sure he was drunk at the time (Tr. 81).\nDuring his second marriage, Applicant \u201ccleaned up his act\u201d and was sober for\nalmost 13 years. In July 2002, Applicant confronted his brother at a gas station about\nhis brother\u2019s theft of $3,000 from Applicant\u2019s home. The altercation escalated into\npunching and shoving by Applicant, and his brother struck Applicant\u2019s truck with a pole\nas Applicant departed. Applicant was charged with domestic assault (two counts) and\ndomestic disorderly conduct. He was ordered to attend a domestic violence program\nconsisting of 40 hours of classes, and placed on six months unsupervised probation.\n(Ex. 3, Ex. 5, Ex. 6, Tr. 81- 91) Applicant resumed drinking after this arrest (Tr. 86).\nBefore starting work for his current employer, Applicant completed a security\nclearance application (SF 86) on January 23, 2003. In response to question 26\nconcerning a record of any offenses within the past seven years not otherwise listed,\nApplicant disclosed he served six months probation for a July 2002 domestic disorderly\noffense. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 24 concerning whether he had ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs (Ex. 1). He claims\nto have had no recall of several of the offenses (Tr. 52).\nOn August 26, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service\n(DSS) special agent about the July 2002 incident. Applicant explained that he had an\naltercation with his brother after confronting him about taking $3,000 from his residence.\nHe indicated he had obtained legal representation as he wanted his brother to pay for\ndamaging his truck with a pole, but the \u201ccourt did not pursue this matter apparently\nbecause we were brothers.\u201d Applicant denied the offense was alcohol or drug-related.\n(Ex. 3)\nAs of May 2004, Applicant was in an apprenticeship program at work to become\na shipfitter. During his first month in the department, he consistently worked at a level\nhigher than his peers and was given special projects. He continued to show initiative on\nthe job, although subsequent performance ratings varied from one of the best to\naverage. (Ex. B)\n\nThe evidence is conflicting as to when his marriage ended. He gave the date of his divorce as 2006 (Tr. 101),\n1\nbut also testified his spouse left him in November 2006 (Tr. 108). In light of his subsequent testimony\nconcerning his relapses (he drank after his wife left him until he got in trouble, he stopped drinking, he was\nthen laid off, and celebrated his recall to work by drinking, Tr. 109-10) it is likely that his second wife left him\nin late 2005 rather than 2006. Applicant also testified that he was married in 1989 and they divorced after 16\n1/2 years (Tr. 46), which is also consistent with a separation date in 2005 and divorce in 2006. \n6\nIn about November 2005, Applicant came home from work to find that his wife\nhad left him (Tr. 43, 102, 108).  He began drinking alcohol on weekends, at least six\n1\nbeers per occasion (Tr. 110-11) until January 2006, when his drinking again led to his\narrest (Tr. 109). After consuming a few beers to \u201ca buzz\u201d at a bowling alley (Tr. 92),\nApplicant was stopped by the police in early January 2006 on report of a possible drunk\ndriver. Applicant was observed repeatedly reaching down to his right side as the officer\nwas talking to him. As Applicant exited his vehicle at the officer\u2019s request, the police\ndetected the scent of marijuana. A cellophane bag containing suspected marijuana was\nfound between the driver\u2019s seat and center console, and Applicant was arrested for\npossession of marijuana. He pleaded nolo contendere on advice of counsel. He was\nfound guilty, fined, and placed on six months probation. Following an evaluation, he was\nnot referred for further counseling. (Ex. 4, Tr. 91-98). Applicant reported the incident to\nhis security office at work (Tr. 36). Applicant denies he used any marijuana on the\noccasion of his arrest or that he even knew it was there (Tr. 97-98). His claims his\nbrother used his truck several times and that it must have been his (Tr. 97-98), but it is\ncontradicted by police observation and Applicant\u2019s testimony that he had not reconciled\nwith his brother since the July 2002 incident (\u201cthe farthest that I\u2019ve really done is we\nhave talked a few times. But not really. It\u2019s not the same.\u201d Tr. 91).\nAfter his arrest, Applicant stopped drinking. In October 2006, he was laid off from\nwork (Tr. 110). During his layoff, he was interviewed on March 14, 2007, by a\ngovernment investigator about his arrest for possession of marijuana in January 2006.\nApplicant averred he had been pulled over for a lane violation, and complied with a\npolice request to search his vehicle \u201cas he had nothing to hide.\u201d Applicant\nacknowledged that the police had found a small bag containing marijuana in the seat,\nand that he pleaded nolo contendere in court to the possession charge. Yet he\nmaintained that his brother had admitted to him in July 2006 that it was his marijuana as\nhe had borrowed Applicant\u2019s vehicle in the past. Applicant denied any use of marijuana\nother than a few times in high school in about 1977 and any intent to use marijuana in\nthe future. (Ex. 2)\nIn March or April 2007, Applicant was recalled to work for the defense contractor\n(Tr. 110). He had been having financial problems, and excited at his recall, went out to\ncelebrate with some friends. After drinking to intoxication at a bowling alley, Applicant\nwas arrested for disorderly conduct (Tr. 29-30, 99-100, 110). He pleaded nolo\ncontendere and was sentenced to 15 hours of community service. As of January 2008,\nApplicant had not reported this arrest to his employer (Tr. 36, 106).\n\n7\nSince August 2007, Applicant began receiving the care of a doctor of osteopathy\nfor treatment of \u201cDepression and Addiction Problem\u201d (Ex. E). Applicant has been seeing\nthe physician weekly (Ex. E, Tr. 44, 104).\nIn January 2008, Applicant began counseling with an employee assistance\nprogram clinician. He had two sessions with the counselor by late January, due in part\nto the therapist being unavailable. Applicant has committed to attend the EAP sessions\non a weekly basis for help with relapse prevention. (Ex. D)\nApplicant considers himself an alcoholic, although to his knowledge he has never\nbeen diagnosed as alcohol dependent (Tr. 102). Applicant has attended Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) on and off for the past 20 years (Tr. 103). Applicant attended AA a\ncouple of times in 2007, but none thereafter as he \u201cdid not want to believe that [he]\nneeded to go.\u201d (Tr. 113). Applicant has not attended AA in the past 18 months (Tr. 113).\nAs of January 2008, Applicant was not consuming any alcohol and did not plan on\ndrinking in the future (Tr. 43-44).\n \nSometime after he arrested Applicant in January 2006, the police officer began a\npersonal relationship with a member of Applicant\u2019s family. He has observed Applicant to\nbe a family man quick to lend a hand to others. (Ex. A)\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor attests to Applicant being polite and a hard worker\nwho has never caused him any problems at work. (Ex. C)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n8\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG\n\u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d Applicant was arrested 16 times between\nSeptember 1978 and April 2007 for offenses related to alcohol and/or anger\nmanagement issues. With the exception of the April 1984 assault and battery charge (\u00b6\n1.e), the evidence proves some culpability on Applicant\u2019s part, even when charges were\ndismissed or adjudication withheld. He failed field sobriety tests when arrested for DUI\nin September 1978 (\u00b6 1.a), and was intoxicated when arrested for disorderly conduct in\nJanuary 1981 (\u00b6 1.b), and for shoplifting in August 1983 (\u00b6 1.c). He admits he argued\nwith a cab driver in September 1983 (\u00b6 1.d) after drinking, and was sentenced to two\nmonths (suspended) for the November 1984 disorderly conduct outside the nightclub (\u00b6\n1.f). He was convicted of assault, threatening, malicious destruction, and harassing\nphone call charges in 1987 and 1988 (\u00b6\u00b6 1,g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j). While the 1989\nthreatening charges were dismissed (\u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m), he admits he made several\ntelephone calls to his ex-wife while under the influence of alcohol. He was placed on six\nmonths probation and required to complete a domestic violence program for domestic\n\n9\nassault and disorderly charges involving his brother in July 2002 (\u00b6 1.n), and despite his\ndenials of ownership, the evidence and the finding of guilty support my conclusion that\nhe had marijuana in his possession in January 2006 (\u00b6 1.o). More recently, he drank to\nintoxication to celebrate his recall to work in April 2007 resulting in his arrest for\ndisorderly conduct (\u00b6 1.p). Security concerns are implicated under AG \u00b6 31 (a)(\u201ca single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted\u201d). Furthermore, since his June 1988 threatening offense was in\nviolation of his probation for the November 1987 assault, AG \u00b6 31(e) (\u201cviolation of parole\nor probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program\u201d) also\napplies.\nAG  \u00b6 32 (c) (\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense\u201d) applies, but\nmitigates only of the April 1984 charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\n(\u00b6 1.e). An evaluation of his criminal conduct shows no recurrence of the threatening or\nassaultive behavior since he completed the domestic violence program in 2002/03. Yet\nApplicant continued to allow his use of alcohol to cloud his judgment with negative legal\nconsequences, raising significant doubt about whether he can be counted on to abide\nby rules and regulations. His January 2006 marijuana possession and April 2007\nalcohol-related disorderly conduct are too recent to apply AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence\nof successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d). It is especially\ntroubling that Applicant was involved with illegal drugs at age 46 and after he had\napplied for a security clearance. He exhibits little reform where he continues to deny any\nknowing possession of marijuana in the face of a police report showing Applicant kept\nreaching for the area where the marijuana was found, and by blaming his ex-girlfriend,\nhis ex-wife, and even a cab driver for his threatening and/or abusive behavior.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set out\nin AG & 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and untrustworthiness.\u201d By Applicant\u2019s admission, alcohol was\ninvolved in his criminal behavior excepting the July 2002 assault offense (SOR \u00b6 1.n).\nAG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent\u201d), applies. \nApplicant expressed his personal belief that he is an alcoholic, but it is not\nsufficient to establish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence that would require\nconsideration of AG \u00b6 22(d) (\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence\u201d). An osteopathic physician certified that Applicant has been under his care\n\n10\nfor \u201cDepression and Addiction Problem.\u201d A diagnosis of dependence by his osteopathic\nphysician would require a showing of abstinence to satisfy either AG \u00b6 23(b) (\u201cthe\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser))\u201d or \u00b6 AG\n23(d) (\u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a\nsimilar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program\u201d). The physician\u2019s use of the vernacular \u201caddiction problem\u201d\ncertainly suggests dependency, but it is not clear whether the physician was making a\nwell-informed diagnosis, generalizing based on what Applicant told him about his past\ndrinking, or simply repeating Applicant\u2019s untrained characterization of his problem.  The\nmedical records of Applicant\u2019s treatment with the physician were not made available for\nreview. The fact that Applicant had been drinking before so many criminal incidents\ntends to indicate an alcohol abuse problem at a minimum.\nIrrespective of whether Applicant suffers from an alcohol abuse or an alcohol\ndependency problem, it is too soon to conclude that his alcohol problem is safely in the\npast. Applicant testified, and the absence of any alcohol-related incident from 1989 to\n2006 confirms, that he maintained a sustained period of sobriety. However, this did not\nprevent him from relapsing into abusive drinking in about November 2005 when his\nspouse left him. He drank on weekends, in quantity of at least six beers per occasion,\nwhich he claims was not enough for him to become intoxicated (Tr. 110-11). After his\nJanuary 2006 arrest for marijuana possession, Applicant apparently did not drink until\nApril 2007, when he went out to celebrate his recall to work. His irresponsible\nconsumption, well after he had applied for his security clearance, raises significant\njudgment concerns. Applicant is credited with seeing his physician weekly since August\n2007, and with committing himself to sessions with an EAP counselor. AG \u00b6 23(b)\napplies in part because of these recent actions to deal with his alcohol problem, but not\nenough is known about Applicant\u2019s treatment with his physician, who merely confirmed\nthat he has been seeing Applicant regularly since August 2007. Although the focus of\nhis therapy with the EAP clinician is relapse prevention (Ex. D), Applicant has been to\nonly two sessions due to Applicant rescheduling twice and the clinician\u2019s absence for\nthree weeks. Applicant also testified, with no rebuttal from the Government, that he has\nbeen abstinent since his last arrest for disorderly conduct in April 2007. In light of his\nabuse history, this is not long enough to enable the predictive judgment that his alcohol\nabuse is not likely to recur.  Furthermore, while Applicant testified to his belief that he is\nan alcoholic, his testimony that he was not drunk after consuming six beers casts doubt\nabout whether he has adequate insight into his alcohol problem. None of the other\nmitigating conditions apply.\n\n11\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s reliability and dedication\nat work are not enough to overcome the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption\nconcerns, given the domestic violence and substance abuse problems that resurfaced\nafter more than a decade of responsible behavior. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest at this time to grant or continue a clearance for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 30, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to another administrative judge on December 6, 2007. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on December 18, 2007 scheduling it for January 10, 2008. The case\nwas transferred to me on January 9, 2008, and I convened it as scheduled. During the\nhearing, I received six Government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 18, 2008. Based upon\nFebruary 12, 2008\n\n2\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except\nsubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old, single man who earned a bachelor of science degree\nin marketing and international business in 2000. Since 2003, he has worked for a\ndefense contractor as a pricing analyst.\nBetween 1995 and 2003, Applicant smoked marijuana approximately 15 times\n(Tr. 18). He stopped around the time he obtained his current job. At that time, he was\ninformed of his company\u2019s drug policy.\nOn January 20, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). After spending the night in jail, he was released pending a\nhearing scheduled for March 14, 2006. At the hearing, he was found guilty, sentenced\nto 10 days in jail to be served on weekends, fined, and ordered to attend a 10-week\nalcohol-awareness program. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s intake interview with the alcohol-awareness program\ncoordinator, he disclosed that he had smoked marijuana on one occasion in February\n2006, between the DUI arrest date and the DUI trial (Tr. 14). Consequently, he was\nordered to take a drug test. He failed, testing positive for marijuana, and was then\nordered to meet with a drug counselor (Answer at 1). After one meeting, the drug\ncounselor decided he did not need additional drug counseling (Tr. 44). \nApplicant subsequently completed the alcohol-awareness program, as ordered. It\nconsisted of group counseling approximately once per week, and 16 Alcoholic\u2019s\nAnonymous sessions (Tr. 36). Before the DUI arrest, Applicant had never been\narrested. He has not been arrested since then. \nAt the time of Applicant\u2019s DUI arrest, he had not smoked marijuana in nearly\nthree years. Since the February 2006 relapse, he has neither used it, nor associated\nwith people who use it (Tr. 17). \nIn March 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In response\nto the question of whether he had used illegal drugs within the past seven years, he\nanswered \u201cYes,\u201d and disclosed his marijuana use between 1995 and 2003. He did not\ndisclose the February 2006 marijuana use. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question of\nwhether he had ever used drugs while possessing a security clearance. The\n\nThe record contains no evidence of the clearance level, or whether or not it was an interim clearance.\n1\n3\ngovernment had granted applicant a security clearance  approximately three months\n1\nbefore his marijuana relapse (Exhibit 2 at 7).\nApplicant met with a security clearance investigator in December 2006 (Exhibit\n3). He voluntarily disclosed the February 2006 marijuana usage (Id. At 2).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use from 1995 through 2003, his\n2006 recurrence after being granted a security clearance, and his subsequent failed\ndrug test trigger the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug use,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting\npositive for illegal drug use,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a\nclearance.\u201d\n\n4\nApplicant has not used marijuana since 2006, and he no longer socializes with\npeople who use it. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as [a] disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d applies.\nAlthough Applicant has only used marijuana once in the past five years, I was not\npersuaded that AG 25(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. According\nto the Appeal Board, \u201c[e]lapsed time between an applicant\u2019s last drug use and a Judge\u2019s\ndecision must be evaluated in light of the record as a whole\u201d (ISCR Case No. 06-18905\n(App. Bd. November 16, 2007) at 3). Here, Applicant used marijuana after being\ngranted a security clearance, and while a DUI trial was pending. Under these\ncircumstances, it is too soon to ascertain whether Applicant will remain marijuana-free.\nHe has not mitigated the drug involvement security concern.\nGuideline H, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s omission of his one-time 2006 marijuana use raises the\nissue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\nApplicant asserts the omission was not intentional. He disclosed his marijuana\nuse that occurred between 1995 and 2003, and described it in detail. Although he\nomitted the 2006 use, he voluntarily disclosed it to a security clearance investigator 10\nmonths later. Under these circumstances, his assertion that the omission was\nunintentional is credible. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. Applicant did not intend to falsify\nhis security clearance application.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Id.). Here,\nApplicant\u2019s DUI conviction and his security clearance omission raise the issue of\nwhether AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single, serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d applies.\nApplicant did not intentionally falsify his security clearance application, therefore, he did\nnot violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001. His DUI arrest and conviction was isolated, and he\ncompleted the terms of the sentence. AG \u00b6 30(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\n\n5\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s DUI conviction no longer poses a security concern. Although he\ndeserves credit for eventually disclosing his February 2006 marijuana recurrence, it\ncontinues to pose a security concern. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use through 2003 could\narguably be attributed to youth and immaturity. However, the recurrence occurred when\nhe was 28 years old, six years after finishing college, three years after he had begun\nworking for a defense contractor, and approximately one year after he had been granted\na security clearance. Although he seemed sincerely remorseful at the hearing, it is too\nsoon to conclude under these circumstances that his marijuana use will no longer be an\nissue in the future. Evaluating this case in light of the whole person concept, I conclude\nhe has not mitigated the drug involvement security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The Board will consider\nthe sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings to the extent necessary to address the issues which\nDepartment Counsel has raised on appeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.7(a): \u201ccontact with a foreign family member . . . or other person who is a citizen of or\n2\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.7(b): \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information[.]\u201d\nThe Board has remanded cases in order for the Judge to make findings of fact and conclusions regarding the\n3\ncurrent geopolitical situation in Russia.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-14508 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2008) (\u201cThe Board\nalso notes certain events which have occurred since the close of the record and which have a bearing on this case.  In\nAugust 2008 Russia attacked Georgia . . .  For a discussion of official notice in DOHA proceedings, see ISCR Case No.\n05-11292 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) . . . A current and accurate assessment of the \u201cgeopolitical situation\u201d and the\n\u201csecurity/intelligence profile of the country vis-a-vis the United states\u201d is crucial in Guideline B cases.  See ADP Case\nNo. 06-14978 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 11, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007).  In this case,\nApplicant has regular contact with citizens of a country that has engaged in armed conflict with a democracy friendly\nwith the U.S. . . .   This is a matter bearing on the Guideline B security concern, which requires consideration of the\nnature of the foreign country.\u201d)  In light of Board\u2019s disposition of the case under consideration here, however, no point\nwould be served in remanding it for additional findings on these matters. \n \n4\nIn the analysis section of his decision, the Judge stated that \u201cthe [G]overnment failed to\nestablish a disqualification under Guideline B.  Considering the country involved, Russia and the\nU.S. enjoy competitive foreign relations, although they cooperate on a wide variety of issues.  While\nRussia is actively engaged in the collection of U.S. information, there is no evidence suggesting that\nit targets its expatriate citizens . . .\u201d  Decision at 4.  Department Counsel  argues that the Judge erred\nby concluding that the Government produced no evidence of heightened risk under section 7(a) of\nGuideline B.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument is persuasive.  The Board notes the Judge\u2019s findings\nand record evidence demonstrating that Applicant has a close family member in Russia, with whom\nhe regularly communicates; that Applicant has a business partner who at the time of the hearing was\na citizen of Russia; that Applicant served in the Red Army; and that Russia is a nation with a\nproblematic human rights record that actively seeks U.S. intelligence.  Viewed as a whole, these\nmatters are sufficient to raise a Foreign Influence security concern.   As pointed out by Department\n2\nCounsel, the Judge\u2019s conclusions in this case have the practical effect of requiring Department\nCounsel to prove affirmatively that Russia specifically targets U.S. citizens in the course of its\nattempt to gather protected information.  The language of the Directive (Guideline B) on this topic\nis inclusive and does not require this level of proof from Department Counsel in order to raise\nsecurity concerns that shift the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion on this\nmatter is not sustainable.3\n Department Counsel also challenges the Judge\u2019s decision under Guideline E, arguing that\nthe Judge erred in concluding that the evidence presented by the Government did not demonstrate\na security concern.  Question 17a of the SCA required an applicant to state whether he has any\n\u201cforeign property, business connections, or financial interests.\u201d  Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 10.\nAs stated above, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to this question.  The Board notes GE 2 at 6, which is a\nsummary of Applicant\u2019s security clearance interview.  This exhibit describes Applicant as identifying\na foreign national (FN) with whom he was, at the time of the interview, a partner in a business\n\nApplicant testified that, from an early age, he perfected his English by reading widely in American literature,\n4\nincluding the works of James Fenimore Cooper, Jack London, and Theodore Dreiser.  Tr. at 45.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.15: \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor . . . can raise questions about an\n5\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure\nto provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process . . .\u201d \nThe Judge did not permit Department Counsel to question Applicant as to what kind of information he\n6\nunderstood Question 17a to be soliciting.  The Board concludes that Applicant\u2019s understanding of the meaning of this\nquestion is relevant and a proper matter for cross-examination. \n5\nventure involving software development.  The Board also notes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR,\nand the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, concerning another company founded by Applicant and which has\nforeign clients in Europe, Asia, and Russia.  The names of these clients suggest that they are\ncompanies engaged in business activities.  GE 3, Answers to Interrogatories, at 4.  Under the facts\nof this case, Applicant\u2019s SOR response and the other record evidence described above; Applicant\u2019s\napparent command of English,  his formal education, and business experience; and  the clarity of the\n4\nquestion at issue here constitute substantial evidence of a false statement concerning foreign business\nconnections, which raises security concerns under Guideline E.   The Judge\u2019s conclusion that the\n5\nGovernment had not presented security concerns under Guideline  E is not sustainable on this record.\nFurthermore, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not willfully falsify his SCA is not\nsustainable in light of the contrary evidence in the record.   The Board pays special attention to GE\n2 at 6, in which Applicant explained why he left FN\u2019s name off his SCA.  \u201cThis contact is not\nreported on his security form because it is a business relationship, and when he was required to fill\nout the form for the [interview], he did not want information to be conflicting from original security\npaperwork.\u201d   Although this comment is not elsewhere elaborated upon, it does raise a reasonable\nimpression that Applicant acted with deceptive intent in answering relevant questions.   Additionally,\nthis comment does not appear consistent with Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing to the effect that\nhe left FN\u2019s name off the SCA because, although a Russian citizen, FN resides in the U.S.   Tr. at\n6\n106-7.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not address this apparent contradiction, nor does he assess\nApplicant\u2019s credibility in light of it.  Therefore, the Judge has failed to consider an important aspect\nof the case.   \nThe record as a whole does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of\npersuasion in light of the Egan standard.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision is not sustainable.\n\n6\nOrder  \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.            \nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant answered the SOR 24 December 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 31 January 2008, and I convened\na hearing 2 April 2008.

He has not\n2\npreviously held a security clearance.\nApplicant was born in Russia, then part of the Soviet Union in June 1967. He\ngrew up and was educated there, and performed two-years compulsory military service\nin his early 20s. His ultimate dream growing up was to immigrate to the U.S. In 1990, he\nimmigrated to Israel with his wife because they were unable to obtain visas to immigrate\nto the U.S. However, in 1996 he immigrated to the U.S. on a skilled-worker visa. He\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2003, and obtained his U.S. passport in July\n2003.\nApplicant and his wife have two children: a daughter born in Israel in 1995 and a\nson born in the U.S. in 2001. Applicant\u2019s parents immigrated to the U.S. in 2001. His\nparents-in-law immigrated to the U.S. in 2002. His only relatives still living in Russia are\nhis sister and her family. His sister is a pediatrician working in a medical clinic. It is not\nclear whether the clinic is government-run or a private concern. Her husband manages\na garage.\nApplicant has tried, without success, to persuade his sister and her family to\nimmigrate to the U.S. He flew to Russia in October 2007 to try to persuade her in\nperson, again without success. He does not expect to travel to Russia again, and has\nnot called her since his return to the U.S. However, she calls him every few weeks to\nsee how his family is doing.\n Applicant is alleged to have falsified his March 2006 clearance application (G.E.\n1), by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 17A (SOR 3.a.), summarized on the application print-\nout as \u201cforeign property, business connections, or financial interests?\u201d This answer is\nalleged to be false because a U.S. company co-founded by Applicant 1) had business\nclients in Italy, Spain, Russia, Japan, Israel, and India and 2) Applicant had business\npartners at this company and a second company he co-founded who were resident\ncitizens of Russia. These same corporate connections were alleged to be disqualifying\nbecause of security concerns under foreign influence (Guideline B) and outside\nactivities (Guideline L). Applicant denied the allegations, and the government failed to\nestablish the facts necessary to support the allegations.\nFirst, the companies at issue are, without question, U.S. corporations, having\nbeen founded in the U.S. with U.S. addresses. Second, the government produced no\nguidance that a U.S. corporation with business clients overseas has \u201cforeign property,\nbusiness connections, or financial interests\u201d within the meaning of question 17A. Third,\nApplicant\u2019s evidence established that his two business partners in this first company\nwere naturalized U.S. citizens before the founding of the company, based on the July\n\n3\n1998 and February 1999 issue dates on their U.S. passports (A.E. D). Applicant\u2019s\nbusiness partner in the second company had been a legal permanent resident (LPR) of\nthe U.S. since August 2002 (A.E. D), and had received notice to attend his\nnaturalization oath ceremony in April 2008 (A.E. E). Finally, Applicant terminated his\ninterest in both companies once he became aware of the government\u2019s security\nconcerns (A.E. B, C)\nThe facility security officer at Applicant\u2019s company reports that Applicant is highly\nregarded at the government agency where he works (A.E. A). The agency confirms that\nApplicant is attentive to the agency\u2019s security requirements. \nRussia\u2014a former Soviet Republic\u2014is a nominal democracy with a mixed human\nrights record. It has been the target of terrorist activity in recent years. Russian federal\nforces pursuing terrorists act with impunity while engaging in torture, summary\nexecutions, disappearances, and arbitrary detentions. Additional problems include\ncorruption, media suppression, life-threatening prison conditions, and corruption in law\nenforcement.\nRussia has an active and significant information collection program focusing on\nthe U.S. As of 2005, Russia was one of the two most aggressive collectors of sensitive\nand protected U.S. technology and accounted for much of such targeting. However,\nRussia has not been demonstrated to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation. Furthermore, the U.S. and Russia cooperate over a broad spectrum of\nforeign-policy issues, particularly counter-terrorism efforts.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence), Guideline L (Outside Activities), Guideline E (Personal Conduct),\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n5\n4\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n4\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.5\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B. Considering first the country involved, Russia and the U.S. enjoy\ncompetitive foreign relations, although they cooperate on a wide variety of issues. While\nRussia is actively engaged in the collection of U.S. information, there is no evidence\nsuggesting that it targets its expatriate citizens such that would make Applicant or his\nsister likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence\nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of his family contacts. Applicant\u2019s foreign travel to Russia\nin 2007 has no independent security significance. Applicant\u2019s sister has no\ndemonstrated connection to the Russian government. Department Counsel has\n\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n6\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n5\narticulated no sensible reason I should consider her as a potential source of influence\non Applicant. I conclude that it is unlikely he can be pressured based on his contacts\nwith his sister. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline L.\nThe two companies co-founded by Applicant were U.S. corporations. His co-founders in\nboth companies were either U.S. citizens or LPRs of the U.S. The fact that those\ncompanies had clients who were foreign corporations does not on its face implicate any\ndisqualifying condition under Guideline L, and the government offered no independent\nevidence to connect Applicant to a foreign entity within the meaning of the guideline.\nNor did the government produce evidence to show that Applicant was required to\ndisclose these outside companies, regardless of clientele. Finally, Applicant disposed of\nhis interest in both companies out of an abundance of caution. I resolve Guideline L for\nApplicant.\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guidelines E\nand J.  This conclusion does not flow from any analysis of Applicant\u2019s credibility\n6\nregarding why he failed to list his two outside companies on his clearance application,\nbut from the government\u2019s failure to produce facts demonstrating that these two\ncompanies or their client list constituted \u201cforeign property, business connections, or\nfinancial interests\u201d within the meaning of the relevant question on the clearance\napplication. I resolve Guidelines E and J for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

On January 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive);\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated\nJan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on April 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 4, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 23, 2008. The government offered\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified in\nhis own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through L. DOHA received the transcript\nMay 8, 2008\n\n2\nof the hearing on May 1, 2008. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony,  eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n.Findings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 27, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.f, 1.h, 1.k-1.q, and 2.a, with explanation. He denied\nthe factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, and neither admitted nor denied 1.j of the SOR\nHe also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a public\ntrust position.  \nApplicant is a 40-year old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1986 and continues to take college courses. He is single and has no\nchildren. Since January 2003, Applicant has worked in a position for a federal\ncontractor. He submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, on November 7,\n2006 (GE 1). \nIn 1987, shortly after high school, Applicant was charged with forgery. He admits\nthat he signed a check that was mistakenly delivered to his address. He deposited the\ncheck in his bank account. He does not recall other details but he admits he was\nconvicted and placed on probation. He made restitution (Tr. 91 and (GE 7)\nAgain in 1989, Applicant was convicted of forgery and theft by taking. He and\nsome friends found checks and signed them. In addition, he ordered a piece of\ncomputer hardware and did not pay for it or return it to the company (Tr. 93). Applicant\nwas incarcerated from May 1990 until October 1990. He explained that his home life\nwas not good. He stated that his family was physically and emotionally abusive to him\nand he rebelled by acting out (Tr. 33).\nIn 1992, Applicant was convicted of writing bad checks. He was placed on\nprobation for six months. Again, in 1993, he was convicted of bad checks and theft by\ndeception (GE 7). He recalled he \u201ccame across some checks\u201d and cashed them.  He\ndoes not recall his sentence or how much time he served, but he received probation for\nfive years (Tr. 96-98). During this probation period, Applicant worked for a church and\nhe received counseling. His record also indicated that he violated his probation in 1995\nfor a traffic incident. He does not agree that this was an actual violation of probation but\nhe agreed he was taken to jail until his probation officer was notified of the situation (Tr.\n100).\nFrom 1996 until 2003, prior to his employment with federal contractors, Applicant\nworked as a consultant and as a technology officer in different companies. The only\nperiod of unemployment that Applicant reported was approximately nine months from\nearly 2006 until late 2006 (Tr. 69). The majority of his debts precede that time period.\nDuring cross-examination, Applicant admitted that during the 2006 period of\nunemployment several of his checks were returned for insufficient funds, but it was not\nhis intention to have his checks bounce.\n\n3\nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling approximately $20,000. Applicant\nadmits to approximately $15,000 in delinquent debt. At the hearing, Applicant asserted\nthat some debts were disputed with the credit reporters. He did not provide them with\nany documentation but stated the debts were not his (Tr. 88). According to Applicant,\nhis documents are in storage in another state and he has not had an opportunity to\nretrieve them (Tr. 21). He stated that some records were destroyed (Tr. 66). In some\ninstances the debts have been removed from his 2008 credit report (AE J ). He is still\ndisputing some that have already been investigated and are still on his credit report.\nDespite his admissions to debts in the SOR, at the hearing he explained that he was\nstill disputing many of them and is waiting for the creditors to verify the amount due (Tr.\n61). He is also trying to negotiate with three creditors so that he does not pay interest\nand fees. His answers to questions in his September 2007 interrogatories differ from\nanswers he provided in an interview in January 2007 (GE 5 and GE 6). \nThe current status of the accounts in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/ Amount\nStatus\n1.a\n$226   Credit card\nDisputed\n1.b\n$133   Phone collection\nDisputed/Removed\n1.c\n$1,845 Collection\nRemoved\n1.d\n$2,498 Credit card \nAdmits/Unpaid\n1.e\n$707   Credit card \nRemoved\n 1.f\n$222   Collection (returned check)\nRemoved\n 1.g\n$275   Dental\nDisputed\n1.h\n$206   Collection (returned check)\nDisputed\n1.I\n$6,807 Credit card\nAdmits/Unpaid\n1.j\n$259   Medical\nDisputed\n1.k\n$1,442 Credit card\nAdmits/Unpaid\n1.l\n$5,236   Credit card\nAdmits/Unpaid\n1.m\n$1,465   Credit card\nDisputed\nApplicant stated that he would make arrangements to pay and he is willing to\nresolve the debts if he and the companies can agree to an amount. He contests certain\ninterest and fees that have been included (Tr. 82). Applicant provided no\ndocumentation of payment or payment plan for any of the debts. At the hearing, he was\nclear that he would honor his debts when an amicable payment arrangement was\nreached (Tr. 111). He added that he has not paid some of the larger bills because he is\n\nApplicant stated he now has access to his credit reports and has a fraud alert on them.\n1\n4\nconcerned that he may face unemployment if he does not obtain a favorable\ntrustworthiness determination (Tr. 113).\nWhen Applicant signed his Standard Form SF 85P, Questionnaire for Public\nTrust Position on November 2006, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 20 concerning his\nfinancial record - 180 day delinquencies.\nApplicant explained that he thought he checked \u201cyes\u201d for that question. He states\nthat it was just a clerical error. He is adamant that he did not falsify his application or lie.\nHe further noted that he did not realize until the investigation that he had checked \u201cno\u201d.\nHe was in a hurry to complete the application and did not check it. Applicant stated that\nhe was forthright in his interview with the Government and never denied that he was in\ndebt. He was rushed to complete the form but he also stated that it took him four hours\nto complete. He regrets the error and acknowledges that when he signed the document,\nhe did not reread it.\nApplicant has a net monthly income of $5000. After monthly expenses, he has a\nnet remainder of $2,590 (GE 6). He also has some savings and a retirement account.\nIn January 2007, Applicant was interviewed by investigators as part of the\napplication process. He maintains that he was fully cooperative with the investigator in\nanswering questions about his debts and repeated that he did not hide anything from\nthe investigator (Tr. 104). He disputed many accounts and stated he had no intention of\npaying some of them. At that time he also explained that he would not pay accounts\nuntil the debts could be verified by the creditor or collection agency. However, he also\npromised to set up payment plans on some of them. He originally told the investigators\nthat he had no knowledge of some of the accounts. However, at the hearing Applicant\nadmitted that prior to 1997, he knew he had debts (he just had not checked his credit\nreports).  He also added that he had not received notices for some of the debts, but\n1\nthen stated that he moved frequently and that might be the reason that he had not\nreceived notices from some of the creditors.\nApplicant\u2019s current employer states that Applicant is in \u201cexcellent standing\u201d with\nthe company (AE A). His employee performance appraisals for 2007 reflect that he has\nsuccessfully demonstrated the core tenets of his job. In addition, he received a\npromotion in April 2008 for exceptional dedication and work performance to clients and\ntechnical managers. One of his colleagues, a retired Navy Officer, praises Applicant for\nhis integrity, dedication and commitment to the team and Government clients. He rates\nhim as a valued member of the team. He recommends Applicant for a position of\ntrustworthiness. (AE B). \nApplicant has not disclosed everything about his background with his current\nemployer. He states that it is in his past when he was immature and is not indicative of\nhis behavior today. He apologizes and regrets the occurrences. He also argued that\nsince he does not handle classified information, he does not think it important to\n\n5\ndiscuss everything with his employer due to his emotional maturity and growth that has\ntaken place (Tr. 99).\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n6\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt on numerous\naccounts charged off or placed in collection beginning in 1999. He admits to $15,000 of\ndelinquent debt that is not resolved. Moreover, under AG \u00b6 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal\nfinancial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax\nevasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional\nfinancial breaches of trust\u201d may raise concerns. Applicant\u2019s forgery, bad checks and\ntheft by deception ad admitted fall under this disqualifying condition. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant has a long history of financial difficulty and the debts are ongoing\nto the present. Applicant\u2019s incidents of forgery and theft by deception are in the distant\npast but they are not mitigated due to his recent falsification and his recent returned\nchecks. He did not present any evidence to persuade me that it is unlikely to recur, nor\n\n7\nthat it does not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. The evidence does not raise this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant listed one period of unemployment in his application. However, he did not\nelaborate on it, nor did he explain what, if any, impact it had on his ability to pay his\ndebts. He presented no evidence to show that he acted responsibly in identifying and\nresolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did not present any information concerning financial\ncounseling. He has not resolved his delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement.\nSince Applicant was on notice about the Government\u2019s concern regarding his financial\ndifficulties and his debts, he has spent time disputing them. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies where\nthe evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue.\u201d Applicant put the burden on the credit reporters to verify the debts. This does\nnot show financial responsibility or a record of payment. The fact that some debts have\nbeen removed from his latest credit bureau report does not mean that he did not owe\nthe debt. Applicant was also firm that he will repay certain accounts if he can be\nassured that certain fees would be removed. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions do not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\n16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\n\n8\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, Applicant offered explanations for his not listing the overdue debts\non his public trust questionnaire. However, the explanations are inconsistent and not\nreasonable. He admitted to knowing that he had significant debt. He said he was\nrushed to complete the application. He then stated that he spent almost four hours on\nthe application. This leaves me with the conclusion that he deliberately omitted them in\nthe hopes that they would not be discovered. I find that he intentionally omitted relevant\ninformation from his application in 2006.\nI have considered the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(a) \u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts.\u201d Applicant did not do so until he was questioned by the\ninvestigators in 2007. None of the other mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been employed with\nhis current employer since 2006. He has some years of experience with a federal\ncontractor. His current employer recommends him. However, his employer is not fully\naware of Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicant expresses regret for his actions and poor\njudgment. However, he has not provided any mitigating information concerning his\nfinancial problems nor his plan to resolve them. Despite the fact that he has managed\nto have some accounts removed from his latest credit report, he has not met his burden\nof proof in this case. Granted, his forgery incidents are in the distant past; however, he\nhas recently had checks bounce for insufficient funds. His recent behavior does not\noutweigh the long history of financial irresponsibility. Moreover, he falsified his\ntrustworthiness application as recently as 2006.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I\n\n9\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising under the\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nB. Daniel Lynch, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 13, 2007,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Security Violations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 7, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant  filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary and capricious; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous; and whether the\ncase raised Guideline E security concerns.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant holds two Bachelor of Science\ndegrees and a Master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering.  He works as an electrical engineer for a\ndefense contractor.  In March 2006 Applicant failed to secure a classified container in an approved\nmanner.  He received a warning letter.  This incident was a violation of the National Security Manual\nand the National Industrial Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  \nIn November 2006 Applicant failed properly to secure classified material and media in an\napproved container.  This too was a violation of the National Security Manual and the NISPOM.\nHe received another warning letter.  Applicant had two prior security violations, not referenced in\nthe SOR.  In 1990 he was cited and counseled for leaving his safe open.  In 2005 Applicant and two\nor three other individuals received warning letters for storing special access material in a safe not\nauthorized for those documents.  Applicant was the primary custodian of the safe.   \nApplicant argues that the Judge did not consider certain mitigating evidence, for example\ndocuments and witness testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s job performance, trustworthiness, and\nsecurity awareness.  The Board has considered all the arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s brief,\nevaluating them in light of the record as a whole.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the\nevidence in the record unless he specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Although Applicant appears to disagree with the weight which the\nJudge assigned to certain pieces of evidence, he has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s analysis is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See ISCR Case no. 07-07144 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2008).\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant points to other decisions, by the Appeal Board and by the Hearing\nOffice, which he argues support his request for a favorable determination.  The Board gives due\nconsideration to these cases.  However, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E2.2.3.  Moreover, Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges\nnor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).

The Board has considered this aspect\nof the decision in light of the record as a whole.  Given the record in this case, any error in this\nregard is at most harmless.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nAugust 7, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November  7,\n2006. On December 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nK and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on April 4, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMay 14, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 11, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing on June 26, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and three other\nwitnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Through counsel, he submitted Exhibits A\nthrough E, which were entered without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\n\n2\nhearing (Tr) on July 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant\nand the additional witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact: \nApplicant is 54 years old. He is married, and he has two children. He has\nreceived two Bachelor of Science degrees and one Master\u2019s Degree in electrical\nengineering. \nApplicant works as an electrical engineer for a defense contractor, and he seeks\na DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline K - Handling Protected Information) \nThe SOR lists 4 allegations under Adjudicative Guideline K. All of the allegations\nwill be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. On or about March 3, 2006, Applicant received a first warning letter from his\nemployer after a security inspection revealed that Applicant had failed to secure a\nclassified container in an approved manner.\nIn the Final Report of Investigation (Exhibit 4), the investigator stated that\nApplicant\u2019s safe was not secured because the \u201clock bar [was] not in place.\u201d An\nexamination of a sample of the material in the safe determined it to be DoD Secret. The\ninvestigator indicated in his report that Applicant informed him that he had \u201cworked late\nand forgot to secure the cabinet.\u201d  Compromise was considered extremely minimal.\nHowever, it could not be ruled out, and therefore Applicant received the Security\nViolation. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s testimony, he conceded that he had inadvertently left open his\nsafe (tr at 72).\n1.b. The security violation, summarized in subparagraph 1.a., above is a violation\nof DoD 5520.22-M, the National Security Manual, dated February 28, 2006, and DoD\nNational Industria Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) Supplement, dated April 1,\n2004.\n1.c.  On or about November 29, 2006, Applicant received a second warning letter\nfrom his employer after a security inspection revealed that Applicant had failed to\nsecure classified material and media, some of which had their specific classification\nmarkings crossed out,  in an approved container.\n\n3\nIn the second Final Report of Investigation, dated February 7, 2007, (Exhibit 4),\nthe investigator stated that Applicant \u201cfailed to store media and two binders marked as\nSecret/SAR/SJS in a SJS approved container within an SJS approved area. [Applicant]\n. . . also failed to conduct proper downgrading procedures and did not take into\nconsideration the media was originated on a SAR system. [Applicant] . . . instead\ndowngraded a disk by marking out the DJS/SAR with a black marker.\u201d\nThe investigator indicated in his report that \u201cbecause the same DoD security\ncontainer was inadvertently left unsecured on 3 March 2006, and the fact it could not be\ndetermined when the binders were placed in the DoD container the potential for\ncompromise cannot be ruled out.\u201d\nApplicant testified that he had removed SAR or Special Access Required from\none of the disks he placed in his file because \u201cI was told that the information [on the\ndisk] was not SAR, and at the time I didn\u2019t understand the rules and regulations of the\nmarkings, cause on hard copy documents, if we knew something\u2019s not SAR, we can\ncross that out.\u201d (Tr at 75-76). \n1.d.  The security violation, summarized in subparagraph 1.c., above is a\nviolation of DoD 5520.22-M, the National Security Manual, dated February 28, 2006,\nand DoD National Industria Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) Supplement, dated\nApril 1, 2004.\nWhile it was not alleged in the SOR, it was revealed during the hearing that\nApplicant has had two additional security violations. Applicant revealed that in\napproximately 1990 he was cited and counseled for leaving his safe open (Tr at 85). \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from January 2004 through November 2007 also revealed\nduring his testimony that an additional warning letter was issued to Applicant in June\n2005, although apparently it was no longer in the file, and therefore was not included in\nthe SOR (Tr at 30-32).  This warning was issued to Applicant and two or three other\nindividuals who shared a safe, because it was determined that special access material\nwas in a safe not authorized for these documents. Applicant was the primary custodian\nof the safe at the time these documents were located to be incorrectly stored.   \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor also testified that there is a web based annual security\ncertification that all program access individuals must complete, and that covers such\nareas as handling of special access materials and storing them in proper containers (Tr\nat 34). Finally, this supervisor submitted a character letter recommending Applicant\nretain his security clearance (Exhibit A).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. The Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s security violation, as alleged in\nparagraph 1, above exhibits questionable judgement and unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations. \n\n4\nMitigation\nApplicant testified that since his last warning he has better organized, cataloged\nhis safe and drastically reduced the number of document in it so he knows exactly what\ndocuments are in the safe to limit the likelihood of having inappropriate documents in it\n(Tr at 91). He also locks his safe now every time he removes a classified document\nrather than waiting until he has finished with the document and replaced it (Tr at 92 -93).\nFinally, two additional witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant, his daughter and\nhis wife. His daughter characterized her father as a very responsible person, who never\nrevealed anything inappropriate about his work to her. Applicant\u2019s wife of 27 years\ntestified that her husband is honorable, truthful, and extremely reliable. Applicant also\noffered into evidence three additional character letters from individuals who know or\nhave known him in his professional or private life (Exhibit D). They all were extremely\nlaudatory in describing  Applicant as careful, honest,  intelligent, and reliable.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information\nWith respect to Guideline K, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper handling of secured information, which resulted in three letters of\nwarning during the period from 2005 through 2007, is of great concern to the\nGovernment. His storing material improperly in his safe, leaving his safe unsecured and\nchanging the classification on a secured disk comes within the Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 34. (b) (collecting or storing classified or other protected information in an\nunauthorized location), (g) (failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or\nother sensitive information) and (h) (negligence or lax security habits that persist despite\ncounseling by management).\nIn reviewing the Mitigating Conditions (MC) under 35., I find that Applicant\u2019s three\nviolations, that occurred within the last three years, are too recent and too frequent to\nconclude that such conduct will not recur again. Based on Applicant\u2019s former\nsupervisor\u2019s testimony about the training that employees receive, I can not conclude\nthat Applicant received improper or inadequate training. While MC (b) (the individual\nnow demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities)\ncan be argued to be applicable, I do not find it controlling because it is too recent from\nthe time of the violations to establish the security significance of this mitigating factor.  \nIn this case, the Government has met its burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has negligently failed to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified information, which raises doubt about his trustworthiness,\njudgement, reliability and willingness and ability to safeguard such information. I find\nthat these events happened too recently and too frequently for Applicant to overcome\nthe Government's case against him at this time.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline K\nof the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\n\n6\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s conduct\ncomes under DC (d) (3) because his pattern of rules violations supports a whole-person\nassessment of untrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations \n I resolve Paragraph 2, Guideline E, against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines K and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including the recency and frequency of rules\nviolations, I find that the record evidence leaves me with sufficient questions and\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole\nperson concept. For all these reasons, I conclude that at this time, Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 17, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 15, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the\nJudge did not articulate a nexus between the circumstances alleged in the SOR and Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility.  He also argues that the Judge gave insufficient weight to the evidence as to\nApplicant\u2019s strong ties to the United States, his testimony that his allegiances lie exclusively with\nthe United States and protecting classified information, and the fact that his in-laws in Lebanon have\nno contact with their government.  Finally, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s overall unfavorable\nconclusion is inconsistent with other hearing-level decisions in which applicants in ostensibly similar\ncircumstances have been granted clearances.    Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on\n1\nthe part of the Judge.\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-22643 at\n7 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not required.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 03-18218 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2005).\nThe Board gives due consideration to the cases cited by Applicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-05903 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  However, the Board has previously noted that decisions\nin other hearing-level cases are not legally binding precedent, even if an applicant can establish close\nfactual similarities between those cases and his case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile his decision in this\ncase with decisions in other ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables\nknown as the whole-person concept.\u201d  Directive at \u00b6 E2.2(a).  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own\nmerits . . .\u201d Id at \u00b6 E2.2(b).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\n\n3\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09542 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007). \nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge found\nin favor of Applicant under Guideline C and with respect to some of the factual allegations under\nGuideline B.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nJudge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number of variables to reach a common sense\ndetermination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2(c).  In some instances, this process led to favorable findings for\nApplicant.  However, the Judge also articulated a reasonable concern that Applicant's circumstances\ncould make him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Decision at 10.  That\nconcern is based on close ties to his in-laws in Lebanon and his repeated visits to Lebanon with his\nspouse and children, considered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country\nvis-a-vis the United States.  Applicant offers an alternative interpretation of the record evidence.\nHowever, that alternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s\ninterpretation arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his unfavorable\ndetermination under the disqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there\nis sufficient record evidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the\nJudge to err on the side of national security.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(b).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple      \nMichael D.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is the 46-year-old chief executive officer of a building material procurement and general contracting company seeking to do business with the State Department. He has never held a clearance. Applicant was born in Lebanon. When he was 13 years old, he and his family moved to France. Applicant testified his father was an ambitious, self-made man, who saw that Lebanon had no future (Tr. 93). Applicant decided to attend college in the U.S. because his father had a high regard for U.S. education and had worked all his adult life with U.S. firms and organizations (Tr. 38). He came to the U.S. on a student visa, and obtained bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from U.S. universities (Tr. 6, 38-39). He became a U.S. citizen in 1993.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on April 3, 2006. On \nOctober 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C \n(Foreign Preference). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 1, 2007 and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on November 13, 2007. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 7, 2007, and the case was \nassigned to me on December 12, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, \n2008, setting the case for January 30, 2008. Applicant requested a continuance on \nJanuary 22, 2008, which I granted. His request for a continuance and my order granting \nApril 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nit are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II.  DOHA issued a second \nnotice of hearing on February 6, 2008, setting the case for February 26, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through P, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 7, to enable him to \nsubmit additional evidence. On February 29, 2008, Applicant requested additional time \nto submit evidence, and I extended the deadline until March 14, 2008 (HX III). Applicant \ntimely submitted AX Q, and it was admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nresponse to AX Q is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit IV.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 5, 2008. The record closed on March 14, 2008.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of adjudicative \nfacts about Lebanon and Syria. The request and its enclosures were not admitted in \nevidence but are attached to the record as HX Exhibit V. I granted Department \nCounsel\u2019s request, except for one paragraph based on Enclosure 9 to HX V, a report \nprepared by the Congressional Research Service. I declined to take administrative \nnotice based on Enclosure 9 because there was no showing that the facts recited and \nconclusions reached had been accepted as not subject to reasonable dispute by any \nagency of the United States (Tr. 30-35). See Fed. R. Evid. 201. Enclosure 9 was \nredesignated as GX 5 and admitted without objection. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out below in my Findings of Fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is the 46-year-old chief executive officer of a building material \nprocurement and general contracting company seeking to do business with the State \nDepartment. He has never held a clearance.  \n \nApplicant was born in Lebanon.  When he was 13 years old, he and his family \nmoved to France. Applicant testified his father was an ambitious, self-made man, who \nsaw that Lebanon had no future (Tr. 93). Applicant decided to attend college in the U.S. \nbecause his father had a high regard for U.S. education and had worked all his adult life \nwith U.S. firms and organizations (Tr. 38). He came to the U.S. on a student visa, and \nobtained bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from U.S. universities (Tr. 6, 38-39). He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1993.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse also is a native of Lebanon.  They were married in the U.S. in \nJune 1992. She earned a degree in architecture in Lebanon, came to the U.S. around \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1989, and became a U.S. citizen in February 2000. They have three children who are \nnative-born U.S. citizens.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has four siblings.  Two sisters reside in the U.S. and one in \nFrance. The record does not reflect their citizenship. Her brother is a citizen and \nresident of Lebanon and works for her father\u2019s construction company (Tr. 67-68). The \ncompany does mainly residential construction and has no ties to the Lebanese \ngovernment (Tr. 68).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother was born in Syria and moved to Lebanon as a child.  Both his \nmother and father are citizens of Lebanon, became U.S. citizens in October 1993, and \nreside in France. His mother has never been employed outside the home, and has no \naffiliations with foreign governments. His father was an industrialist, manufacturing \narchitectural building materials. He is now retired. He has had no affiliations with foreign \ngovernments or foreign armed forces.   \n \nApplicant has regular telephone contact with his parents. His parents visit him in \nthe U.S. once or twice a year and stay with him or his brother during their visits. His \nparents last visited Lebanon at least five years ago. They visited primarily to see friends, \nbecause they have very little family left in Lebanon (Tr. 69). They have no property or \nfinancial interests in Lebanon (Tr. 69). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother was born in Lebanon, completed his education in the \nU.S., and became a U.S. citizen in November 1993. His younger brother was born in \nLebanon and became a U.S. citizen in March 2002. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nLebanon. They have been visiting the U.S. for extended periods for 20 years, and they \nreceived permanent resident status in the U.S. in April 2004 (AX J, K; Tr. 60). However, \nApplicant testified his in-laws have deep roots in Lebanon (Tr. 95). Applicant has regular \ntelephonic contact with them, and he testified he has \u201chigh affection\u201d for them (Tr. 90). \n \nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse and their three children visited her parents for a \nweek in Lebanon in 2007. His spouse and the two older children used Lebanese \npassports (Tr. 70). The third child, a two-year-old, traveled on a U.S. passport (Tr. 71). \n \n \nApplicant has visited Lebanon annually, usually during the summer to visit family \nwith their children. He used a Lebanese passport, even after he became a U.S. citizen, \nbecause Lebanon is the country of his birth. He testified he gained nothing in \nconvenience or financial cost by using his Lebanese passport (Tr. 79). He used his U.S. \npassport for all other travel. At the hearing, he expressed his willingness to surrender or \ndestroy his Lebanese passport (Tr. 78-79). He destroyed it in the presence of an official \nof the Defense Security Service on March 11, 2008 (AX Q). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nDuring a security interview in February 2007, Applicant told a security \ninvestigator he was willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship (GX 3 at 3). He \nreiterated his willingness to renounce his Lebanese citizenship at the hearing (Tr. 60). \n \nApplicant\u2019s company was formed in July 2003 to supply material to U.S. \ncontractors in Afghanistan and Iraq. He and his older brother are the owners of the \ncompany (Tr. 84). His company has performed numerous contracts for the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers and the State Department (AX P), and it was named as the State \nDepartment \u201cSmall Business of the Year,\u201d based on its performance of one of those \ncontracts (AX D, N, and O).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s company has been prequalified by the State Department to \nparticipate in new contracts for construction of classified facilities (AX L, M; Tr. 57). The \nState Department sponsored his application for a clearance (GX 4 at 3, 5). His \napplication is supported by several senior State Department officials (AX B, F, H) as \nwell as several business colleagues (AX A, E, G, I). State Department officials describe \nhim as \u201chonorable and completely reliable,\u201d with \u201cimpeccable business and professional \nstandards,\u201d and a \u201cstellar performer.\u201d One colleague describes him as a person of \n\u201cimpeccable integrity, brutal honesty, and sound judgment.\u201d All colleagues commented \nfavorably on his honesty, integrity, and high professional standards. \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse are active in their local church, local swim teams and \nsoccer teams, and community services.  He coached soccer for several years at a local \nrecreation center (Tr. 40). \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts about Lebanon and \nSyria. Lebanon is a parliamentary republic that has been in a state of war with Israel \nsince 1973. Its foreign policy and internal policies are heavily influenced by Syria, who \nmaintains intelligence agents in Lebanon and is a state sponsor of terrorism. The \nunstable political situation in Lebanon enables foreign terrorist organizations to operate \nwithin its borders. Hizballah is the most prominent terrorist group in Lebanon. The \nLebanese government recognizes Hizballah as a legitimate resistance group and \npolitical party. Hizballah maintains offices in Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon, has \nliaison officers to Lebanese security forces, and is represented by elected deputies in \nthe Lebanese parliament. Hizballah is closely allied with Iran, supports a variety of \nviolent anti-Western groups, and has been involved in numerous anti-U.S. terrorist \nattacks.  \n \n \nLebanon has a poor human rights record. Lebanese security forces have \nengaged in arbitrary arrest, murder, torture, and other abuses. There is an atmosphere \nof government corruption and lack of transparency. Militias and non-Lebanese forces \noperating outside the area of Lebanese central government authority have used \ninformer networks and monitored telephones to obtain information about their perceived \nadversaries. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s parents are dual citizens of Lebanon and the U.S. \nresiding in France (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and b), his spouse is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the \nU.S. residing in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.c), his spouse\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of \nLebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and he traveled to Lebanon in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). The security concern under Guideline B is set out in AG & 6 as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member . . . if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a). A \ndisqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n7(b). Finally, a security concern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d). \n \nWhere family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign \ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are U.S. citizens and they do not reside in a hostile country.  \nThe SOR does not allege any security concerns arising from their connections with \nFrance, and Department Counsel presented no evidence raising such concerns. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen and resident of the U.S., but her parents, although \npermanent U.S. residents, also reside in Lebanon for much of the time and have deep \nroots there. Applicant has \u201chigh affection\u201d for his in-laws and maintains regular contact \nwith them. The presence of his in-laws in Lebanon and their vulnerability to abuse by \nLebanese authorities as well as terrorists in Lebanon raises the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \n\u00b6 7(a) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse resides in the U.S., where she is less vulnerable to terrorism.  \nHowever, she visits her parents regularly in Lebanon, accompanied by family members. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s ties of affection and obligations to both his spouse and in-laws, \nthere is a \u201cheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d \nexercised indirectly on him through his family ties. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 7(d) is raised.  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \n\n \n8 \n \n \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). This condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s relationships \nwith his in-laws are close, and they reside in a country with a poor human rights record \nwhere terrorism is rampant and a terrorist organization is part of the political structure. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.  The \nAppeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that an \napplicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interests of the family member and the interests of the U.S. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 6 (App. \nBd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). Thus, an administrative judge was not \npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the \nnew guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to his family and in-laws certainly is not \u201cminimal.\u201d  He is still \nconnected to his Lebanese heritage, as demonstrated by his continued his of his \nLebanese passport, but he has no love for the current government of Lebanon. He, his \nspouse, and children continue to visit family members living in Lebanon. The evidence \nis insufficient to establish that Applicant would be likely to resolve a conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interests if his spouse, children, or in-laws were threatened by foreign \nagents, Lebanese security forces, or terrorist groups operating in Lebanon. Thus, I \nconclude Applicant has not met his burden of establishing this mitigating condition. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Lebanon and the \nU.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.a), he has an active Lebanese passport that was renewed after he \nbecame a U.S. citizen (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and he used his Lebanese passport to travel to \nLebanon on several occasions (SOR \u00b6 2.c). The exercise of Lebanese citizenship \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a is the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and c. Thus, SOR \u00b6 2.a is \nduplicated by \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and c, which plead the evidence supporting \u00b6 2.a. When the same \nconduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under the same guideline, the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. \nBd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \nand c in Applicant=s favor.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts \nin such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, \nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful \nto the interests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. Dual citizenship standing alone is not \nsufficient to warrant an adverse security clearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at \n5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not \nwhether an applicant is a dual national, but rather whether an applicant shows a \npreference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep 15, 1999). \n \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant\u2019s repeated use of \nhis Lebanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen raises this disqualifying condition. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). This mitigating condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). Applicant told a \nsecurity investigator he was willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship, and he \nrepeated his willingness to renounce it at the hearing. This mitigating condition is \nestablished. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may \nbe mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). The destruction of his passport on \nMarch 11, 2008, establishes this mitigating condition. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal citizen of the U.S., deeply devoted to his family and a valued \nmember of the community. All his immediate family members are U.S. citizens. He has \nestablished an impeccable business reputation and a personal reputation for integrity, \nhonesty, and loyalty. The presence of his in-laws in Lebanon and the political conditions \nin Lebanon are beyond his control. He has taken significant steps to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns in the SOR. Nevertheless, the presence of his in-laws in Lebanon, his \nbonds of affection for those in-laws, and his repeated visits to Lebanon, accompanied \nby his spouse and children, present a vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress that is not mitigated. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference, but he has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 29, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification of a\nsecurity-clearance application. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nApril 2, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n Directive, \u00b6 2.2 (By mutual agreement, the Directive extends to other federal agencies, to include NASA).\n3\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on December 3, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 17, 2008. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on March 13, 2008, and the transcript (Tr.) was received on March 21, 2008.\nApplicant presented no documentary evidence at the hearing. Therefore, the\nrecord was left open until March 28, 2008, to provide him an opportunity to do so.\nApplicant timely submitted matters, which were forwarded by department counsel who\nmade no objections. The post-hearing matters are admitted as follows: (1) Exhibit\nA\u2013IRS documentation; and (2) Exhibit B\u2013statements for Visa credit card account.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges multiple delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a\u2013\u00b6 1.j)\nranging from $100 to $8,982 for about $90,000 in total. His response to the SOR is\nmixed, admitting and denying various debts. Under Guideline E, he admits the\nallegations that he made deliberately false statements when answering two questions\nabout his financial record on a security-clearance application. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 61-year-old security guard who works for a company that provides\nsecurity services to an NASA facility.  He has worked as a security guard at the same\n3\nNASA facility since 1978, initially part-time and then full-time since 1980. During his\nyears as a security guard he has worked in positions of authority such as key-control\nclerk and dispatcher. He currently earns about $13 per hour. His educational\nbackground includes completing high school and two years of junior college. \nApplicant has been married since 1972. His wife is now 56 years old. They have\nlived at the same residence since 1973. They have two adult children, ages 27 and 24,\nand one grandchild. His wife was employed throughout their marriage until about 1994\nwhen she was injured, had surgery, and was unable to work. She received disability\ninsurance until she was adjudicated as disabled for social security purposes in about\n1998. Since then, she has received disability payments and she currently receives\nabout $1,500 monthly.  \n\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. For example, a January 2007 credit\nreport shows 17 of 49 accounts in the trade section of the report have some sort of\nderogatory information; the report also shows 6 accounts in the collections section\n(Exhibit 2). The delinquent debts in the SOR are established by the credit reports\n(Exhibits 2, 4, and 5). He has not contacted any of the creditors in the SOR. Nor has he\npaid, settled, or resolved any of the debts in the SOR. In general, he plans to pay the\ndebts off and will do so by starting with the smallest debt and working his way up (Tr.\n32\u201333). \nHe has, however, resolved two other matters. The first was an outstanding debt\nowed to the IRS for tax year 2004 (Exhibit A). He entered into an installment agreement\nwith the IRS with a beginning balance of about $1,400, and he completed his payments\nduring 2006\u20132007. The second was a Visa credit card account with a credit union that\nhad a balance of about $1,900 (Exhibit B). Beginning in February 2007, he made\nseveral monthly payments of various amounts resulting in a zero balance by December\n2007. In addition, about three to four years ago, he refinanced his home mortgage and\ntook out about $25,000 in equity. He used the money to make payments to various\ncreditors. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his wife\u2019s inability to work and the\nloss of her salary. His wife was earning about $55,000 annually and their lifestyle and\ndebts were based on two incomes (Exhibit 3). He attempted to remedy this situation\nwith a second job as a security guard. He worked full-time at two jobs for about three\nyears until his own health problems forced him to stop in November 2007.\nIn his testimony, he estimated having about $400 in the bank. Also, he estimated\na $5,300 balance in a 401(k) account. Aside from his house, that is the totality of his\nfinancial assets. He had no idea of how much money his wife has, as they handle their\nmoney separately, including responsibility for paying bills.\nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in December 2006 (Exhibit\n1). When signing the application, he certified that his statements were true, complete,\nand correct to the best on his knowledge and belief and were made in good faith, and\nhe acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under\nfederal law. In particular, he answered two questions about his financial record as\nfollows:\n\u2022\nQuestion 28a\u2013asking if in the last seven years he had been over 180-days\ndelinquent on any debts, to which he replied \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose any debts;\nand \n\u2022\nQuestion 28b\u2013asking if he was currently over 90-days delinquent on any debts,\nto which he replied \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose any debts. \nHe gave negative answers to the two questions because he knew his job was on the\nline and he was trying to keep it (Tr. 71). \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n4\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n6\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions under Guideline F). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,\n19\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n5\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n17\n18\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none\napply. Two deserve discussion. First, MC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014does not apply.  The injury and disability of Applicant\u2019s wife were factors that\n19\nled to the financial problems. This circumstance reduced the family\u2019s income and\n\n MC 4 is \u201c the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n20\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n21\nconditions under Guideline E).  \n Revised Guidelines at p. 10.\n22\n6\nstrained the family budget. The MC does not apply, however, because Applicant did not\nact reasonably under the circumstances. Much time has passed since his wife\u2019s injury\n(1994) and her adjudication of disability (1998), and this should have been sufficient\ntime to adjust. Although some slippage could be expected and tolerated under the\ncircumstances, it appears Applicant and his wife did not make the necessary\nadjustments to their lifestyle in light of their reduced income. That is not reasonable\nconduct under the circumstances.   \nSecond, a potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to\ninitiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  He\n20\nhas taken some positive steps to resolve his financial problems as evidenced by paying\noff the IRS and the Visa credit card account noted above. But his efforts, in light of the\nremaining unaddressed financial problems, are not enough to qualify as a good-faith\neffort. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s stated intent is to resolve his financial problems, he has\ndone little so far to demonstrate his intent. What is missing here is: (1) a realistic and\nworkable plan to clean up his financial house; (2) documented actions taken in\nfurtherance of the plan; and (3) a measurable improvement to the situation. Given the\ncurrent circumstances, it is likely that the financial problems will continue or recur\nbecause he is facing a mountain of financial problems. Accordingly, Guideline F is\ndecided against Applicant. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n21\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations [that may] raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or\nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d22\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made false statements when providing answers\nto two questions about his financial record when he completed a security-clearance\napplication. He admitted giving false answers in his reply to the SOR, and he explained\nin his hearing testimony that he did so in an attempt to keep his job. Taken together, the\ncircumstances show Applicant was trying to hide his financial problems. This situation\n\n DC 1 is the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n23\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n7\nraises a security concern and falls squarely within DC 1,  which includes the deliberate\n23\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from a security questionnaire. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E have been considered and\nnone apply. His explanation\u2014he wanted to keep his job\u2014may be an understandable\nsentiment, but it is not an acceptable explanation in extenuation or mitigation. Making\nfalse statements during the security clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is\nnot easily explained away, extenuated, or mitigated. Applicant has not presented\nsufficient evidence to do so. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On March 12, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 20, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 2, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nJuly 11, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR at 1.\n1\nGE 1 (Security clearance application) at 1, 8.\n2\nId. at 5-7; Tr. 26-30.\n3\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request in April 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on April 29, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 2, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on May 9, 2008, which Applicant received on May 15, 2008. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on June 4, 2008. The government offered three\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 3. All were received and admitted into evidence, except GE 3,\nwhich the government withdrew. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He did not submit\nany exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2008 and\nthe record closed on June 4, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nEvidentiary Ruling\nApplicant objected to the admission of GE 4, arguing incorrect dates of birth and\naddresses in the report. After discussion with Applicant and Department Counsel, I\noverruled his objection and admitted GE 4 into evidence. (Tr. 17-24)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 2.a of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 2.b of the SOR.1\nApplicant, who is 25 years old, works in data acquisition for a Department of\nDefense contractor. He began his current employment in September 2006 and\ncompleted his security clearance application (SF-86) immediately.2\nHe graduated from high school in 2000, and currently attends college part-time.\nHe is working on his bachelor\u2019s degree. He holds a second degree black belt in Tae\nKwon Do. He previously taught Two Kwon Do at a local facility to students between the\nages of 10 and 35. He currently lives with his parents.3\nOn June 20, 2001, the police began investigating a complaint against Applicant\nfor furnishing obscene material to a minor. During the investigation, the police arrested\nApplicant and charged him with eight criminal counts. Applicant hired an attorney to\nrepresent him, and denied the allegations which served as the basis for his arrest. In\nDecember 2005, the prosecutor dismissed the charges against him without prejudice\n\nGE 4 (Police report); Tr. 35-38, 47-51. I carefully listened to Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing and have\n4\nread the police report and transcript of his testimony. It is not necessary to review all the details of the\ncircumstances surrounding his arrest as it is not necessary for my decision.\nGE 4, supra note 4, at 29-31, 35, 37, 70.\n5\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 20-21; Tr. 70-80.\n6\n3\ndue to witness lack of co-operation. The prosecutor has not re-filed the charges and the\ntime to file has expired.  \n4\nStatements by the Applicant as written by the police in the investigative report\nreflect that before he was read his rights, Applicant told the police that he accidentally\nsent the obscene material in question to the alleged victim. The investigative report also\nindicates that the police did not find any illegal material on his computers. In his house,\nthe police found a penthouse and playboy magazine. At the hearing, Applicant denied\nany wrongdoing.  \n5\nWhen he completed his security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto the following question:\nSection 23: Your Police Record \nf. In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with or\nconvicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above?\n(Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.00 unless the violation was\nalcohol or drug related.)\nApplicant admitted he answered \u201cno\u201d to this question in his response to the SOR.\nAt the hearing, he acknowledged his \u201cno\u201d answer was intentional. He explained that he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d after talking with a Naval recruiter. Prior to accepting his current job, he\ncontacted a Naval recruiter because he was considering enlisting. He specially asked\nthe recruiter if he needed to list his arrest since his case had been dismissed without\nprejudice and was told no, the same answer he got when he first called a Navy 1-800\nnumber for general information about enlisting. He asked this question because he\nknew he would probably need a secret security clearance if he was in the Navy. He\nfocused his question on the fact that his dismissal was without prejudice and the need\nfor a secret clearance.6\nThe government mailed Applicant interrogatories, which Applicant answered on\nJanuary 31, 2008. Question 3 asks:\nAvailable information revealed a search warrant was executed at your\nresidence on June 27, 2001, after allegations were made that you\nfurnished obscene material to minors. You were charged with four counts\nof Furnishing Harmful Items to Minors, Attempting to Destroy Evidence,\nAggravated Assault, and two counts of Tampering with Evidence. All\n\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and answers dated January 31, 2008) at 4, 8. \n7\nId. at 5, 8.\n8\n4\ncharges were dismissed on December 16, 2005, due to lack of victim\ncooperation.\nPlease provide an explanation of the incident(s) associated with these\ncharges. If you have any documents related to this matter, you may\nsubmit a copy(ies) with your response.\nHe responded that a ludicrous allegation had been made against him by a particular\nindividual suffering from mental problems. He explained briefly the events of the\nevening without going into any details about his arrest or the nature of the charges\nagainst him and the subsequent legal process.  \n7\nQuestion 4 asked Applicant to explain why he did not list the arrest in June 2001\non his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (E-QIP). He stated that\nhe did not answer \u201cyes\u201d to Question f. in Section 23 because he relied upon information\ngiven to him by the person who answered the telephone when he called the 1-800\nnumber for Navy recruiting and the Naval recruiter with whom he spoke.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\nAG \u00b6 30(b) and (f) are not applicable in this case.\n9\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; and\n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated\nrehabilitation program.9\n\nThe government is not required to establish that an applicant has been convicted of a crime for the\n10\ndisqualifying conditions to apply under AG 31.\nBecause AG \u00b6 30(b) and (f) do not apply, the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 32(e) is not raised.\n11\n6\nIn the instant case, the police arrested and charged Applicant with eight criminal counts\nfor furnishing obscene materials to minors, obstructing a criminal investigation,\naggravated assault, and tampering with evidence. Because the police arrested and\ncharged him, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31 (a) and (c) apply.  The government has established its prima\n10\nfacie case.\nSince the government has established its case, Applicant must present evidence\nof mitigation.  Under AG \u00b6 32, the Applicant could mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns through any of the following conditions:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.11\nApplicant argues that since the prosecutor dismissed his case without prejudice,\nhe has established mitigation. The dismissal of his case is not the same as proving that\nhe did not commit the crime alleged.  It has been seven years since the police arrested\nhim and there is little likelihood that the State will re-file his case. He has not been\narrested for any other criminal conduct since this time. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) has some\napplicability because the arrest occurred over seven years ago. However, in light of my\nfindings under Guideline E, Applicant is not entitled to full credit under this mitigating\ncondition.\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions and conclude that none\napply.\n\nThe remaining disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c)-16(g) are not raised in this case.\n12\n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAlthough the following conduct will normally result in an unfavorable clearance\naction or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility, this\nconduct is not at issue in this case:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing condition may be disqualifying in this case:12\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\n(E-QIP) when he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question f in Section 23 about any criminal arrests in\nthe last seven years. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to\napply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. He acknowledged in his response to the\nSOR and at the hearing that he intended to answer \u201cno\u201d to this allegation. I, however,\nfind his rational for answering \u201cno\u201d not credible and conclude that he intentionally\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n13\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nfalsified his answer to this question. The government has established its prima facie\ncase under DC AG \u00b6 16(a) as to allegation 2.a in the SOR.\nFor DC AG \u00b6 16 (b) to apply to SOR allegation 2.b, the government must\nestablish that Applicant\u2019s deliberately falsified material facts when he answered\ninterrogatory questions 3 and 4. Applicant provided a brief response to question 3 which\ndid not provide any details about the circumstances surrounding his arrest. His answer\nto this question evades the specific request to provide full and complete information\nabout the incidents surrounding his arrest. His answer to question 4, however, complies\nwith the interrogatory information requested. I find that he did not falsify his answer to\nQuestion 4, but deliberately avoided providing details about his arrest as requested in\nQuestion 3. DC AG 16 (b) applies. 13\nIn light of my finding of deliberate falsification, none of the mitigating conditions\nset forth in AG \u00b6 are applicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was 19 years old when the\npolice arrested and charged with him serious criminal conduct involving young people.\nSince this time, he has not been arrested for any criminal conduct. Over the last seven\nyears, he has continued studying for his bachelor\u2019s degree and worked steadily. He has\nnot been involved with drugs nor does he have any alcohol problems. (See AG &\n2(a)(4).) \n\n9\nApplicant has not been truthful about his arrest and the facts surrounding his\narrest. He denies he did anything wrong in June 2001 and he has this right until the\nState proves otherwise. However, by failing to acknowledge his arrest as well as the\ncircumstances surrounding it in a forthright manner, he has shown that he cannot be\ntrusted and that he lacks integrity and the capacity to be honest. He is embarrassed and\nashamed of his arrest. He is not required to announce his misconduct to the world. He,\nhowever, must be totally forthright about it. Because he cannot be completely truthful\nabout his conduct to himself and minimizes it, he places himself in a position to be\ncoerced, pressured, or exploited because of his arrest for providing obscene materials\nto minors.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from criminal conduct and\npersonal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 21, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n(1) Applicant argues that he was denied due process because he did not receive a full\ninvestigation of the case, and a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon a totality\nof the evidence.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThe method and scope of background investigations are outside the scope of review of the\nAppeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0293 at 4 (App. Bd. May 5, 2000).  The hearing is the\nApplicant\u2019s opportunity to produce other evidence beyond that developed by his background\ninvestigation for the purpose of rebutting, explaining, extenuating, or mitigating facts to which he\nhas admitted or which have been proven by Department Counsel.  See, e.g., Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The\nJudge is then duty bound to consider all of the evidence developed on the record of the case before\nhim.  Any attempt on the part of the Judge to independently investigate allegations or develop facts\nwould, of course, conflict with the Judge\u2019s role as an impartial fact finder.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n02-32606 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2004).\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nbiased or unfair.  Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in\na manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).  Lack of partiality is not\ndemonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached unfavorable conclusions.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0954 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 1995).  Applicant has not met the heavy\nburden of persuasion noted above, in that he fails to identify anything in the record below that\nindicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to question the fairness, impartiality, or\nprofessionalism of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).\n(2) Applicant also argues that the favorable evidence in the record was sufficient, as a matter\nof law, to overcome any security concerns presented by his close ties to family members in Ukraine.\nThe Board does not find this argument persuasive.\n\n3\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-24013 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2008).\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant under Guideline C and SOR paragraph 1(b).  However, he reasonably explained why the\nevidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B.  The Judge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning\nweighing of a number of variables to reach a commonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In some\ninstances, as noted earlier, this process led to favorable findings for Applicant.  But, the Judge also\narticulated a reasonable concern that Applicant's circumstances created a conflict of interest that\ncould potentially make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.  That concern is based\non close family ties in Ukraine, considered in the context of the overall political/security profile of\nthat country vis-a-vis the United States.  Applicant offers an alternative interpretation of the record\nevidence.  However, that alternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the\nJudge\u2019s interpretation arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101\nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his unfavorable\ndetermination under the disqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there\nis sufficient record evidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the\nJudge to err on the side of national security.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 06-04371 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n18, 2007).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple     \nMichael D.

The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant provided his answer to the SOR on September 4, 2007. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on September 8, 2007 for a hearing that was originally scheduled for\nNovember 26, 2007. At the hearing, four exhibits (AE 1 through 4) were placed in the\nrecord to support the Government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s one exhibit (AE A) was also\nreceived in evidence. Applicant called one witness and also testified. On December 19,\n2007, Applicant submitted one additional exhibit (AE B) through Department Counsel.\nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n2\nThe exhibit (also received in evidence) contains material provided by Applicant through\nhis employer to the Ukrainian Embassy pertaining to his request to renounce his\nUkrainian citizenship. All exhibits were received in evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on December 4, 2007. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the two allegations under the foreign influence guideline and\ntwo allegations under the foreign preference guideline. He is 29 years old, and has been\nmarried for about eight years. He seeks a security clearance. \nForeign Influence\nApplicant was born in the Ukraine in March 1978. He began his college education\nat a private Ukranian university in September 1994. His wife was born in the U.S. in\n1971. After she graduated from a U.S. university with degrees in linguistics and\nRussian, her professor suggested she travel to Ukraine to improve her language skills.\nApplicant\u2019s wife came to Ukraine in the summer of 1995 and spent next three years\nstudying the language, and working for several U.S. companies. Applicant met her in\n1995 while employed in a summer job at the same university. In October 1998, he was\nissued a Ukrainian passport that is valid for 10 years. (SOR 2.a.) \nIn June 1999, Applicant, 21 years old, received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Ecology\nat the Ukrainian university. Following graduation, he married his wife, and they moved\nto the U.S. in September 1999 to build their future. In October 2003, he and his wife\ntraveled to Ukraine for pleasure. (SOR 1.b.) He used his Ukrainian passport. \nIn October 2004, Applicant became nationalized as a U.S. citizen. He obtained\nhis U.S. passport in December 2004, and used the passport for travel to the Ukraine in\nAugust 2006 (SOR 1.b.) for a vacation lasting about 14 days. \nApplicant\u2019s mother (SOR 1.a.), 50 years old, was born in the Ukraine in April\n1957, and is a resident citizen of the country. She has been a genetic scientist for the\npast 25 years, with a concentration on cattle breeding. She has been employed by a\nprivate company that does some work for the Ukrainian Government, and some work\nfor private customers. She has never been a member of the Communist Party. \nApplicant\u2019s stepfather (SOR 1.a.), 58 years old, who married his mother in June\n1987, works for a small, private company as a carpenter in Ukraine. The company\ninstalls doors and windows for its customers.\nApplicant\u2019s two younger brothers (SOR 1.a.) are actually his half siblings born in\nUkraine and currently reside there. Applicant\u2019s middle brother, who is 19 years old and\nattends a private college, will not have to serve in the military due to a medical\n\n Applicant fully disclosed his property interest and stock interest in his security forms identified as GE 1 and\n1\nGE 2.\n3\ncondition. His youngest brother, 16 years old, is a senior in high school. Both brothers\nlive at home with Applicant\u2019s parents. \nAs Applicant noted in his SCA (GE 1), the Government of Ukraine privatized\ngovernment property in the 1990s. Applicant\u2019s family of five was (and still is) living in an\napartment. Under the privatization process, each family member was awarded one fifth\nownership of the apartment.  Applicant estimated his ownership interest in the\n1\napartment was about $4,000.00. Although he immigrated to the U.S. in September\n1999, the Ukranian Government was still billing all apartment interest holders for utilities\nand taxes. His mother eliminated Applicant\u2019s name as an interest holder in the\napartment, so she would not have to continue paying his taxes and utilities. Applicant no\nlonger has a financial interest in the apartment.\nAs a part of the privatization process, the Ukrainian Government also privatized\nsome government businesses by giving stock to its citizens. The citizens were given\ninvestment certificates that could be invested in the Ukrainian economy. Applicant\ninvested his certificate in an oil company, and received about $100.00 in stock. His\nmother was advised that the stock had to be upgraded in some undefined manner,\nrequiring Applicant\u2019s presence at a shareholder meeting in a city in Ukraine. With no\ndesire to travel to the Ukraine or keep the stock, he wants to have the old shares\ntransferred to his mother so she can execute the conversion. Applicant estimates the\nstock is worth about $10.00 at the present time.\nApplicant keeps in regular contact with his family in Ukraine. He e-mails his\nfamily once a week, and contacts his family, primarily his mother, by telephone once a\nmonth. His wife\u2019s parents, U.S. citizens by birth, live about 3 \u00bd miles from Applicant. He\nand his wife socialize with them several times a week. Applicant has seen his family\nface-to-face twice since he immigrated to the U.S., once during a vacation in 2003, and\nagain while on vacation in 2006. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife returned with Applicant to the U.S. in 1999, she wanted to\nwork for a newspaper. Instead, she decided to help her mother care for their seriously ill\ngrandmother. When her grandmother\u2019s condition worsened, a permanent nurse was\nhired to take over his wife\u2019s care responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s wife decided to obtain training in the health industry. She completed 1\n\u00bd years of therapy training to become a certified therapist. She opened a\nmessage/therapy business about a week before the hearing.  \nIn his September 2006 interview (GE 3), Applicant repeatedly indicated that\nneither he nor any of his family members had ever been pressured or coerced by a\nforeign entity. None of his family members work or are agents of a foreign country. He\nreceived briefings reminding him to report all foreign contacts. Before he left for the\n\n4\nUkraine in August 2006, he informed his security department. His security officer\ninformed him to report any foreign contact immediately to his security department.\nWhen he returned from his Ukrainian trip, he informed his security department there\nwere no foreign contacts. When asked why he thought the security procedures were in\nplace. He replied:\nWell, it is the information that could be used against the United States by\nsome people that have intentions of bringing down the American\nGovernment, or just destroying the American country. \nIt all might sound like a small bit of information, it might not be important,\nbut when it becomes part of the big picture that is when those groups of\npeople can take certain action. (Tr. 72)\nForeign Preference\nApplicant indicated to the Government in September 2006 he was willing to\nrelinquish his Ukrainian passport if required in order to obtain security clearance access.\n(GE 3) In a letter dated May 23, 2007 (attachment to GE 4), Applicant stated he had no\nintention of renewing his Ukrainian passport, and was ready for suggestions on\nrelinquishing his passport. On November 14, 2007, Applicant initiated the process for\nrenunciation of his Ukranian citizenship by paying $150.00 to the Ukranian Embassy.\n(AE B) \nIn a letter dated November 21, 2007, and addressed to the hearing office of\nDOHA, the Director of Corporate Security with Applicant\u2019s employer explained the\ncircumstances under which Applicant surrendered his Ukrainian passport. On\nNovember 15, 2007, the Director was advised by DOHA that he had authority to take\ncustody of passports. On November 20, 2007, Applicant surrendered his Ukrainian\npassport to his employer\u2019s security office. He was told the passport would not be\nreturned and would be destroyed upon expiration. Applicant was also told his security\nclearance would be administratively terminated if he requested the passport. Applicant\nstated he no longer wanted dual citizenship and had no plans of requesting his\npassport. \nHaving decided to renounce his Ukrainian citizenship, Applicant went to the\nUkrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., and learned from the Vice Council that he\nwould have to submit documentation, including his passport and an affidavit from his\nparents attesting that he owed them nothing. Applicant assembled the appropriate\ndocumentation and his security office mailed the package, including his Ukrainian\npassport (in their possession) on December 18, 2007 to the Ukranian Embassy for\nfurther action. See, AE B. \nSince he began working for his current employer in May 2005, Applicant has\nmade regular contributions to his retirement account. The account is now worth about\n$20,000.00. Applicant also opened a separate retirement account during his previous\nemployment. That account is worth about $5,000.00 Though he could not vote in the\n\n5\n2004 election because he registered too late, Applicant voted in the local, state, and\nnational elections in 2006. \nCharacter Evidence\nIn May 2005, Applicant began working for his current employer as an electrical\ntest specialist. In January 2007, Applicant began working as the Environmental\nEngineer for the Director of Environmental Safety-Occupational Health. Applicant\u2019s job\nis auditing and inspecting the facility, and handling the waste generated. Within the\nperformance evaluation system, according to the Director, that consists of a systematic\narray of stated goals and objectives that are monitored throughout the year, Applicant is\nviewed as a valuable member of the team. In the Director\u2019s view, Applicant has never\nhad a security or safety issue while under his supervision. The Director defined the\nrequirement to report business travel, but was not really certain about the reporting\nrequirements for a pleasure trip, indicating, \u201cI can\u2019t speak to that. I believe there is a\nrequest, but how formal I - -\u201d (Tr. 27)\nThe Ukrainian Government is a parliamentary system with an executive, a\nlegislative and a judicial branch. While freedom of speech is respected by the\ngovernment, freedom of the press is still sometimes subverted. Although the country\nhas achieved remarkable progress in switching from a government-controlled economy\nto a market-based economy, government corruption and serious human rights abuses\nremain at a significant level. Ukraine agreed to nuclear non-proliferation, and provided a\nlarge number of troops to help the coalition forces in the Iraq war. Ukraine cooperates\nwith the U.S. in the war on terrorism. Finally, Ukraine is not on the list of state sponsors\nof terrorism. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n6\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-\nthe-clock responsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nForeign Influence (FC)\nForeign contacts and interests may raise security concerns if the applicant, with\ndivided loyalties, may be manipulated to help a foreign entity that is not in the U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to coercion. \nForeign Preference (FC)\nWhen an individual\u2019s actions show preference for a foreign country over the U.S.,\nhe may be prone to make decisions harmful to the U.S.\nAnalysis\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual with\ndivided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced by a foreign entity,\nor is vulnerable to coercion or pressure. Adjudication under this guideline should\nconsider the identity of the country where the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, and whether the country targets U.S. citizens for intelligence information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe government has established a case for disqualification under the foreign\ninfluence guideline. Applicant\u2019s mother, stepfather, and two brothers were born and live\nin Ukraine. His mother has been a genetic scientist for 25 years. His stepfather is a\ncarpenter and his half brothers attend school. FI disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a.\n\n7\n(contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\napplies. Applicant has regular contact with his foreign family members who are resident\ncitizens of Ukraine. This contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation under\nthe 7.a. of the FI guideline. \nAfter considering the entire record, I conclude that neither FI MC 8.a. (the nature\nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.), nor FI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.,S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest), nor FI MC 8.c. are applicable. \nOne of the elements of FI MC 8.a. is an evaluation of the country involved.\nRecognizing that friendly as well as unfriendly nations have conducted intelligence\ngathering against the U.S., the nature of a country\u2019s government and its relationship\nwith the U.S. is still relevant in determining whether an applicant\u2019s family are subject to\ncoercion or pressure. It logically follows that the risk of pressure is greater in a country\nthat has an authoritarian type government, and/or whose interests are inimical to those\nof the U.S., and who conducts intelligence gathering or is on the list of state sponsors of\nterrorism. Ukraine has a democratic form of government with an improving market\neconomy. It is not a state sponsor of terrorism, and there is no evidence that it is\nengaged in intelligence gathering. However, there is evidence of corruption in the\ngovernment, and less than commendable human rights record. \nIn evaluating the positions or activities of Applicant\u2019s foreign family members as\nrequired by FI MC 8.a., the totality of the family ties to a foreign country as well as each\nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 00-0317, (Ap. Bd. Mar. 29,\n2002) Though none of the family members work directly for or are agents of the\nUkrainian Government, there is evidence showing how close Applicant is to his family\nmembers. Though he has seen his family twice in the last eight years, he e-mails them\nonce a week and telephones them about once a month. Pressure could be placed on\nthem or through them to Applicant, putting him in a position of having to choose\nbetween them and the U.S.\nFI MC 8.b. does not apply because Applicant\u2019s ties to the Ukraine are not\nminimal. Second, though his ties to the U.S. are emerging, there is only about 11\nmonths of evidence concerning his job performance, and almost no independent\nevidence of relationships and loyalties away from the job. FI MC 8.b. is inapplicable due\nto the close relationship between Applicant and his foreign family members.\nSubparagraph 1.a. is resolved against Applicant.\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.b. of the SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s pleasure trips to Ukraine in\n2003 and 2006 raise security concerns under the FI guideline. Applicant used his\nUkrainian passport in 2003 before he became a U.S. citizen. In 2006, he used his U.S.\npassport. Both trips were related to family relationships and have no independent\nsecurity significance. Subparagraph 1.b. is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHaving weighed and balanced the SOR with the chronological circumstances of\nthis case, Applicant\u2019s foreign property interests, although alleged under the foreign\npreference (FP) guideline, should be evaluated under the FI guideline, as the record\ndoes not suggest or infer Applicant is trying to take any action as set forth in FP DC\n10.a.2. (residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements), or FP DC\n10.a.5. (using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another\ncountry) FI DC 7.e. (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation) has application to\nApplicant\u2019s $4,000.00, or one-fifth property interest in an apartment owned by his family,\nand the $100 in stock Applicant has in the Ukrainian oil company. \nThe record does not address Applicant\u2019s income and/or the combined income of\nhe and his wife. Applicant did talk about his other U.S. assets. He mentioned his\n$20,000.00 retirement account with his current employer, and his $5,000.00 account\nwith a previous employer. Applicant credibly testified his mother was successfully able\nto rescind his apartment interest so she would not have to pay his utility and tax\nobligation in addition to hers. The only plans Applicant has regarding the $100.00 in\nstock (that is only worth about $10.00 currently), is to transfer the stock to his mother so\nshe can take the necessary steps to preserve the stock and  place ownership in her\nname. \nWhile I believe FI DC 7.e. does not apply to circumstances because a\nsubstantial property interest is not involved, I find that Applicant\u2019s property interest\ndoes not cause a conflict and could not be used to pressure Applicant. FI MC 8.f. (the\nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such\nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure the individual) applies to mitigate Applicant\u2019s foreign property\ninterests. Subparagraph 2.b. is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nForeign Preference (FP)\nThe concerns of the FP guideline apply to actions that show a preference for a\nforeign country over the U.S. Applicant\u2019s possession of a Ukranian passport (valid until\nOctober 2008), after receiving his U.S. citizenship in October 2004, and obtaining his\nU.S. passport in December 2004, warrants application of FP DC 10.a.1. (possession of\na current foreign passport) \nHowever, Applicant has presented substantial documentation under FP MC 11.b.\n(the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce his citizenship) and FP MC\n\n9\n11.e. (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security office, or\notherwise invalidated) to substantiate a finding for him under the FP guideline. As noted\nin the factual findings, Applicant indicated a willingness to relinquish his Ukranian\npassport. In June 2007, he repeated his willingness and disclosed his investigative\nresults describing the process culminating in the renunciation of his Ukrainian\ncitizenship. In November 2007, he took additional steps to destroy his passport by\nturning it over to his security office for destruction. Finally, AE B indicates that Applicant\nhas executed all the steps to complete renunciation process. Subparagraph 2.a. is\nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept\nIn reaching my ultimate findings, I have also evaluated the evidence in the\ncontext of the general factors of the whole person concept found in Enclosure 2, page\n18 of the Directive. Applicant\u2019s strong ties with his foreign family members makes him\nvulnerable to pressure and influence that could be exercised through his foreign family\nmembers to him. Based on the totality of the evidence in the context of the whole\nperson, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the security\nconcerns of foreign influence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C): FOR APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hoffman, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant is an Iraqi born, naturalized U.S. citizen, who has lived in the United \nStates since 1998. He supported military operations in Iraq on multiple occasions \ndeploying with U.S. Army unites. He has substantially more connections to the United \nStates than to Iraq. Applicant\u2019s mother and brother are citizens of Iraq residing in the \nU.S. Applicant has a brother and three sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I conclude \nApplicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under guideline \nB, foreign influence. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \n \n1\nJune 30, 2008\n\nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 18, 2007, detailing security \nconcerns under Foreign Influence.  \n  \n \nOn November 7, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On January 31, 2008, I was assigned the case. On May \n7, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on May 19, 2008. \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were \nadmitted into evidence. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional matters. On June 2, 2008, additional documents were received. Department \nCounsel did not object to the material and it was admitted into evidence as Ex. F. On \nJune 5, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx) I\u2500V. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, the factual \nallegations of the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old translator who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince September 2005, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant received \na letter of recommendation for his work with the U.S. Army. (Ex. A) He was a language \nlinguist and document translator whose \u201cwork entailed long hours in austere conditions \nwith an ever present risk of hostile fire.\u201d (Ex. A)  Applicant was a team player always \nwilling to sacrifice his own time and creature comforts to ensure that the mission was \naccomplished. His language skills, keen personal insights, and cultural acumen enabled \nthe Task Force to accomplish its mission in a timely manner. He received three \nCertificates of Appreciation and a Letter of Appreciation for his support of the mission. \n(Exs. B, D, E, and G)  \n \n \nAs a linguist translating and analyzing captured documents, Applicant helped in \nthe review and translation of thousands of captured documents. (Tr. 26)  Applicant \nsacrificed his home, family, and his own personal safety and security, to travel to Iraq. \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2\n\n(Ex. C) He was recognized for his professionalism, work ethic, maturity, eagerness to \ncontribute, willingness to be flexible, and natural ability to mentor younger contractors. \n(Ex. C and D) He was instrumental in locating the top Al-Qaeda operative in Iraq. (Tr. \n23) Applicant believes he is helped in his job by being born in Iraq and knowing Iraqi \nslang, which other translators did not know. (Tr. 41)  \n \n \nIn 1988, his father, then age 46, who worked for a car parts company died. His \nfather was conscripted to do work with the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi army had the power to \nsimply grab people off the street and conscript them to labor for the army. His father \nsuffered from a kidney problem and had surgery scheduled a week from the day he was \nconscripted. (Tr. 81) He was gone for two months with no communication with his \nfamily. His family did not know his whereabouts and feared he was dead. His father was \nallowed to return home after two months, but died a week after his return.  \n \nApplicant was 16 years old at the time. At age 18, Applicant was required to do \nmandatory military duty with the Iraqi Army. He served from April 1990 until July 1990. \nWhen Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Applicant deserted. (Tr. 32) Had he \nbeen caught, he would have been executed. Two years earlier, his brother had \ndeserted, was captured, but was able to bribe his captors and instead of being executed \nwas sentenced to two years imprisonment. (Tr. 83, 112) His brother was jailed from \n1986 to 1988.  \n \nIn 1991, Applicant and his brother, surrendered to the U.S. Army and went to a \nPOW camp in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 33) He was there for one year and four months, from \nApril 1991 to August 1992, before coming to the U.S. as a refugee. (Tr. 33)  Leaving as \na refugee, Applicant lost his Iraqi citizenship. (Tr. 77) In October 1998, he became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. He describes the day as an excellent day and as \u201cthe happiest \nday of his life.\u201d (Tr. 120) In February 2004, he was hired by a language resource firm. \nFrom February 2004 until August 2004 he prepared for his first deployment. From \nNovember 2005 to November 2006, December 2005 to January 2006, and in February \n2007 until his clearance was removed in October 2007, he served in Iraq with the U.S. \nArmy as a translator. (Exs. 2, B, D, and E, Tr. 27, 28) During his three deployments to \nIraq, Applicant had no contact with any of his relatives living in Iraq. When his siblings \nask about his job, he tells them he is a cook. (Tr. 38, 93) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother has been a resident of the U.S. since 2000. His mother has \nno desire to return to Iraq. She wants to stay in the U.S. and have her family join her \nhere. (Tr. 70, 124) His mother applied to bring four of his seven siblings who are living in \nIraq to the U.S. (Tr. 67) His siblings dream of coming to the U.S. (Tr. 124) Applicant has \nthree sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq and do not work outside the home. \nHe has not seen his sisters since he left Iraq in 1991. He talks with two of his sisters \ntwice a month and the other sister four times a year. (Ex. 3) Applicant\u2019s mother usually \ncalls his relatives in Iraq and Applicant may talk with his siblings. (Tr. 118-119)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s one sister, whose husband sells cars part-time, was a former bank \nclerk. Her husband is also an engineer working for the Iraqi Navy in oil sales. (Tr. 102-\n103) Applicant last talked with this brother-in-law in 2004. (Tr. 118) He has a sister, who \n \n3\n\nwas widowed in 2004, who lives in Iraq and is unemployed. At one time, he sent funds \nto help his widowed sister. Since 2006, he has sent no funds. (Tr. 47) His brother in \nGermany now supports this sister. (Tr. 85, 98) His youngest sister is divorced, lives with \nher sister, and is also unemployed.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother living in Germany also left Iraq as a refugee. His \nbrother was a cook who wants to open a grocery store, but since August 2006 has \nworked for a spice company. (Tr. 86) Applicant has a brother who lives with him in the \nU.S. and is working to become a U.S. citizen. His brother must be a U.S. resident for \nfive years before he can apply for citizenship. His brother just married and is returning to \nschool. Since leaving Iraq in 1991, he has seen his brother who lives in the U.S. He saw \nhis youngest brother who he saw in 1999 when Applicant visited Syria. (Tr. 115) In \n2004, Applicant saw his brother in Germany when Applicant was deploying to Iraq and \nhad a nine hour delay at the airport. (Tr. 116)  \n  \nApplicant has a brother who works on a farm in Australia and has become an \nAustralian citizen. (Tr. 99) His youngest brother lives in Iraq and was working in an \nelectrical equipment store, but is now a student studying computer science. (Tr. 102, \n117) \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law who was a store owner died. His mother-in-law \nis unemployed and lives in Iraq. (Tr. 107) His wife has two brothers and a sister living in \nIraq. His sister-in-law is an in home tutor. One of his brothers-in-law is in the Iraqi Army \nworking forthe U.S. forces. (Tr. 108, 134) His other brother-in-law is a barber. His wife \nhas telephone contact with them every two weeks to once a month and is trying to get \nthem into the U.S. as permanent residents.  \n \n \nIn May 1999, Applicant visited Syria and Jordan where he visited his family who \nhad traveled from Iraq. This was the first time he had seen his mother in seven years. \n(Tr. 36) Only his youngest brother was able to see him. His other brothers were \nrestricted from leaving the country. (Tr. 36) He was out of the U.S. for 24 days. In June \n2000, he went to Syria to see relatives who traveled from Iraq for his marriage in \nJordan. He had first met his wife when he was 16 years old. (Tr. 88)  \n \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant married an Iraqi citizen who is working on obtaining her \nU.S. citizenship. They have three children all born in the U. S., a son born in August \n2001, a daughter born in 2006, and a son born in 2008. Applicant has no foreign \ninvestments. (Tr. 61) Their home is worth $160,000. Applicant also owns a rental unit \nworth between $80,000 and $100,000. (Tr. 60) Applicant has no loyalty to Iraq. (Tr. 32) \nHe believes Iraq never gave him \u201canything, no respect, no freedom, nothing.\u201d (Tr. 33) \nThe only passport he has is his U.S. passport. (Tr. 77)  \n \n \nApplicant wants to become an Iraqi Advisor, which involves assisting and \nadvising U.S. military commanders and staff. (Ex. F) It requires the ability and \nwillingness to work in close supporting units, operation centers, with other advisors to \nfacilitate meetings between U.S. and Iraqi government officials. (Tr. 43-44)  \n \n \n4\n\n \nIraq \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Iraq is a constitutional, \nparliamentary democracy with a federal system of government. (Hex I) It is a republic \nwith a freely elected government led by a Prime Minister. (Hex I) The 2005 Iraqi \nConstitution guarantees all Iraqis basic rights in many areas. Iraq\u2019s legislative branch \nconsists of an elected Council of Representatives. Iraq\u2019s judicial branch is independent, \nand is under no authority but that of the law. The focus of the United States policy in \nIraq remains on helping the Iraqi people build a constitutional, representative \ngovernment that respects the rights of all Iraqis and has security forces capable of \nmaintaining order and preventing the country from become a safe haven for terrorists \nand foreign fighters. The ultimate goal is an Iraq that is peaceful, united, stable, and \ndemocratic, with institutions capable of providing just governance and security for all \nIraqis and is an ally in the war against terrorism.  \n \nThe risk of terrorism directed against U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remains \nextremely high. (Hex III) The Department of State continues to strongly warn U.S. \ncitizens against travel to Iraq, which remains very dangerous. (Hex V) There is credible \ninformation that terrorists are targeting civil aviation. All vehicular travel in Iraq is \nextremely dangerous. The government was only recently able to diminish violent \nattacks, although large efforts were made to implement better security measures. (Hex \nV) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n5\n\n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, \nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nguideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG & 6) \n \nApplicant mother and seven siblings were citizens of Iraq. His mother now \nresides in the U.S. as does one of his brothers. Another brother is now an Australian \ncitizen living in Australia and another brother lives in Germany. He has three sisters and \none brother who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant left Iraq fleeing the \nHussein regime by going to a POW camp in Saudi Arabia. In 1992, he came to the U.S. \nas a refugee. In 1998, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has been deployed to \nIraq three times working with the U.S. military forces. Having considered all of the \nForeign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable conditions that could possibly \nraise a security concern are AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and AG & 7(b) \u201cconnections to a \n \n6\n\n \n7\nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation\u201d apply. \n \nThe new Iraqi government relies upon the U.S. for support as it moves forward \nwith its new form of government. While Iraq=s human rights record under Saddam \nHussein was very dismal and some problems continue, its human rights record is slowly \nimproving under the new government.  \n \nIn every case where a sibling lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this \nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of \nthis case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or \ncoercion is not substantiated. Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and few ties to \nIraq. While he still has a brother and three sisters living in Iraq, he lives with his wife and \nmother in the U.S. He has no financial or property interests in Iraq. His three children \nwere born in the U.S. He owns a home and a rental house in the U.S. Applicant=s ties \nwith the U.S. are much stronger than his ties with Iraq. \n \nApplicant\u2019s work as an interpreter supported the U.S. military mission in Iraq. He \nhas gone to Iraq three times to work with the U.S. military. He worked long hours in \naustere conditions with an ever present risk of hostile fire. The Army holds his work in \nhigh regard. He provided more than language interpretation skills. He explained local \ncultural nuances and practices which greatly assisted the military in accomplishing its \nmission. During his time in Iraq, he worked very hard to help the Army and developed a \nhigh level of trust with the Army. In part due to his efforts, the highest ranking Al-Qaeda \nleader in Iraq was located and killed and information obtained adversely impacted on \nthe remaining Al-Qaeda members in Iraq.  \n \nIf a heightened risk exists because he has siblings in Iraq, he has mitigated that \nconcern under AG & 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d and AG & 8(b) \u201cthere is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother, works for a spice company in Germany, another \nbrother works on a farm in Australia and is an Australian citizen, a third lives in the U.S. \nand his youngest brother is a student in Iraq. His three sisters do not work outside the \nhome. He has a brother-in-law who is employed by the Iraqi Navy, but Applicant has not \ntalked with him since 2004. None of his siblings are involved with organizations which \nseek to harm the U.S.  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n                                                          \nDuring the three deployments Applicant was in Iraq, he did not contact his \nsiblings. They have not experienced any repercussions from any source because of \nApplicant. There is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his \nclose ties and his loyalties to the U.S., he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nIn the more than 17 years since he left Iraq, Applicant returned three times, each \ntime working closely with the U.S. military as an interpreter. Because he guided the \nArmy personal on local customs and nuances related to the spoken word, translated \ncaptured documents, and responded very well in highly dangerous situations, the Army \nviews him as a valuable resource in helping it achieve its mission in Iraq.2 With his long \nabsence from Iraq, he has few contacts in the country outside of his four siblings.  \n \n2In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), the Appeal Board recognized an \nexception to the general rule in Guideline B cases when \u201can applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and regulations occurs in the context \nof dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the \n\n \n \n \n9\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who go to Iraq, Applicant and his siblings are \nin no greater danger than any other individual living and working in Iraq. The U.S. and \nIraq governments have developed a close and positive working relationship. Iraq \ndepends upon the U.S. to help in its fight to combat the developing insurgency and \nterrorist forces. The Iraq government is moving forward with democracy and developing \na rule of law, with the assistance of the U.S. \n \nApplicant has no love for the former brutal regime. The Hussein regime killed his \nfather, imprisoned his brother, and he and his brother were able to escape the country \nonly by surrendering to the U.S. military and going to a POW camp. When he left Iraq, \nhe was no longer an Iraqi citizen. Frequently, Applicant went in harms way to assist \nU.S. special forces in performing their duties in Iraq. He did this not once, but during \nthree different deployments. The only reason he is not there now is because he lost his \nclearance because of his siblings living in Iraq. \n \nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because \nhe has four siblings living in Iraq. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \nnational security . . .

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nOn January 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 4, 2008, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 7, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge pursuant to \u00b6 \nMay 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nE3.1.7 of the Directive. The request is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The case was \nassigned to me on March 31, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 1, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on April 28, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 7, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nThe SOR references \u201cADP\u201d positions. Department Counsel made an oral motion \nto amend the SOR by deleting any reference to ADP positions and substituting \nappropriate \u201csecurity clearance\u201d language. Applicant did not object to the motion and it \nwas granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 68-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a Bachelor \nof Science degree. He served in the U.S. Navy on active duty from 1959 to 1963 and \nthen in the Naval Reserve until 1989. He retired as a chief petty officer. He has worked \nfor his current employer since 2001. He was married and divorced three times and is \ncurrently married. He has three adult children.1  \n \n \nApplicant was driving a motorcycle in August 2000. A truck sounded its horn \nbehind him. He became distracted and bumped the car in front of him with his \nmotorcycle. Applicant and the driver of the car he struck both pulled their vehicles to the \nside of the road and saw there was no damage to the car. He then returned to the road \nand saw the truck that beeped the horn. He chased after the truck and followed it to a \nparking lot. He went up to the woman driving the truck, got in an argument and \nphysically assaulted her by slapping her. Applicant does not dispute the above events. \nHe and the victim provided different specifics of the events. Applicant\u2019s versions are \nalso inconsistent. He told an investigator in 2006, that he returned to the road after the \nminor accident and he happened to see the truck stopped in a parking lot. This is \ninconsistent with his testimony that he chased the truck. He testified that when he went \nup to her truck, \u201cshe was just a very aggravating kind of person.\u201d He stated he reached \nin the window and slapped her, but did not otherwise strike her and did no damage to \nher truck.2 He testified: \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 41-46; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 49, 59, 78-79; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; GE 2-4; AE A. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nShe was a very large person to start with. And the way she was talking to \nme was very agitating. I mean she was just, very brazen and I just lost my \ntemper.3 \n \n \nThe victim\u2019s description as taken from the criminal and civil complaints was \ndifferent. She stated that after Applicant and the other car pulled to the side of the road, \nshe continued driving. Applicant caught up to her and started sounding his horn at her. \nWhen she pulled off on a ramp, he passed her and stopped his motorcycle at the top of \nthe ramp, blocking her way. He got off his motorcycle and approached her, but she \ndrove around him. He followed her as she pulled into a parking lot. He went up to her \ntruck, screamed and used profanity toward her, opened the door, and struck her in the \nface with his hand. As she was attempting to get out of the truck, he slammed the door \non her leg. Four witnesses observed the assault. She asked for help and said to call \n911. She pulled a pad from her purse to write his license number but he grabbed the \npad from her hand. She grabbed it back and wrote down the plate number. He covered \nhis license plate with a glove and left the scene. She provided the police with the license \nplate number and identified the Applicant in a photo line-up.4   \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with battery and damage to personal \nproperty. He pled guilty to battery and the damage to personal property charge was \ndismissed. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail, suspended, one year of unsupervised \nprobation, 30 hours of community service, and fined $76. He served his probation \nwithout incident.5  \n \n \nThe victim of Applicant\u2019s assault sued him for damages. There was a jury trial in \nFebruary 2004, in which Applicant appeared and was represented by counsel. She was \nawarded compensatory damages of $25,000 and punitive damages of $125,000. \nInterest was also ordered on the judgment to accrue at the rate of 10% per annum from \nthe date of the verdict until paid.6  \n \n \nApplicant has not paid any part of the judgment against him. He has stated that \nhe does not plan on paying anything on the judgment. He told an investigator in \nSeptember 2006, that he did not feel that it was a fair judgment, that he had a \u201clousy\u201d \nlawyer, and that the court was stacked against him because he was not born in the \nstate where the trial was held. He reiterated in a statement provided in a response to \nInterrogatories, dated November 28, 2007, \u201cI have not made any payment toward the \ncivil action judgment against me and I don\u2019t intend to.\u201d In his Answer to the SOR he \nstated, \u201c[d]ue to no action taken I don\u2019t believe that I will ever be presented with any \ndetermination of a payment plan or method of payment; therefore, until such a plan is \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 60. \n \n4 GE 2-4. \n \n5 Tr. at 46-47; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; GE 2-3. \n \n6 Tr. at 47-49, 52; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; GE. 2, 4-6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nestablished I don\u2019t plan to do anything about making payment.\u201d7 He was asked about \npaying the judgment at his hearing: \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: How about the judgment? Do you think it\u2019s fair that you \nwould have to \u2013-  \n \nAPPLICANT: No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair at all, Your Honor. I don\u2019t think \nwhat I did deserves any of that at all, I really don\u2019t. \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: Are you not paying it because you don\u2019t have the money \nor because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or both? \n \nAPPLICANT: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair at all. And, of course, I don\u2019t have \n$150,000.00.  I\u2019m just barely trying to get all my debts paid off and like \nthat. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair at all. \n \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: I understand. \n \nAPPLICANT: I really think I got railroaded out.  I\u2019m not a [citizen of state \nwhere judgment issued]. And [state where judgment issued], I think that \nhas a lot to do with it. \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: So I take it, even if you had the money, you would not \npay it, voluntarily? \n \nAPPLICANT: I would have to think about that one, Judge. If I had the \nmoney, it might be a different story, but I don\u2019t have the money.8 \n \n \nApplicant married his current wife in 2005. She is from another country. He has \nnot told her about his conviction or about the judgment against him. He stated that he \njust did not see a reason to tell her about it. His co-workers are also unaware of the \nconviction and judgment. Applicant testified that while he was not proud of his \nconviction, he would reveal it if necessary, and it could not be used as a basis for \nblackmail or coercion.9 \n \n \nApplicant responded to a DOHA Interrogatory on May 28, 2004, asking him to \nprovide the result of the lawsuit held in February 2004. He responded: \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 52-54; GE 2; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; AE A. \n \n8 Tr. at 61-62. \n \n9 Tr. at 76-78. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe outcome of the civil lawsuit against me was that I pay one hundred \nfifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) to the plaintiff plus 10% interest per \nannum until paid. No payment of settlement has been determined.10 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on June 16, 2006. Applicant listed his conviction for battery under the \nquestion that asked about his police record. Question 28a asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He answered \u201cNo.\u201d Question \n29, asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been a party to any public court actions not \nlisted elsewhere on this form?\u201d He answered \u201cNo,\u201d but he listed a \u201c[c]ivil suit resulting \nfrom traffic accident\u201d and \u201c[s]uit went to court and plaintiff won but no further action \noccurred.\u201d11  \n \nApplicant denied the two falsification allegations in the SOR. He stated he \nalready provided the requested information via the Interrogatory.12 I considered all the \nevidence, including the Interrogatory and the derogatory information that Applicant \nincluded in the Questionnaire. I find there is insufficient evidence for a finding that \nApplicant intentionally falsified his Questionnaire for National Security Positions as \nalleged in the SOR.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n                                                          \n10 AE A. \n \n11 GE 2. \n \n12 Tr. at 28-33. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and convicted of battery against a woman after a traffic \nincident. This raises both of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFour Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing his \ncriminal act. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) are not applicable. The incident happened almost \neight years ago and there is no other criminal record or history of similar incidents. \nApplicant says he is sorry about the incident, but does not appear particularly \nremorseful. He continues to blame the victim of the assault for causing him to lose his \ntemper. He has also refused to pay any of the judgment which a civil court ordered him \nto pay to the victim of his assault. Applicant was 60 years old when he committed this \nassault, an age where he should have known better. While there is some evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation, I am unable to find that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) is not \napplicable. AG \u00b6 32(d) has been raised as a factor for consideration.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \n\n \n8 \n \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant omitted some information from his Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions; however, he had already provided the information to DOHA through an \nInterrogatory. There is insufficient evidence to find that it was a deliberate omission. AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c are concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a alleges the $150,000 judgment addressed above. The judgment is \nnot personal conduct on Applicant\u2019s part. It is a court order for him to pay substantial \nmoney based upon his personal conduct, i.e., the battery of the woman in the truck. \nThat behavior was shocking and reprehensible. It also resulted in a $150,000 judgment \nthat is accruing interest at 10% per year. His actions made him vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable.  \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThere was no evidence that Applicant obtained counseling for the anger that led \nto the assault. He admitted he slapped the woman and pled guilty to the battery in his \ncriminal trial. I am unable to state the behavior is unlikely to recur for the same rationale \nprovided under the discussion for criminal conduct. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are not \napplicable. His wife and co-workers are unaware of the conviction and judgment. He \nhas refused to pay the $150,000 judgment which is growing by 10% every year. He has \nnot sufficiently lessened his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress to \nraise AG \u00b6 17(e) as a mitigating condition.  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has a judgment against him for $150,000 that is accumulating interest \nat the rate of 10% per annum. Both of the above potentially disqualifying conditions \nhave been raised.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n10 \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe judgment against Applicant was the result of his criminal assault. He has \nrefused to pay any part of the judgment. No mitigating condition is applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 68 years old. When he \nwas 60, he chased a woman on his motorcycle, caught her, and physically assaulted \nher. He pled guilty to battery. She sued him and won a judgment against him for \n$150,000, which is accruing 10% interest per year. He refuses to pay the judgment \nbecause he does not think it is fair and he does not have the money to pay it. He \ncontinues to blame the woman he assaulted for aggravating him to the point where he \nlost his temper. I also considered that this was a one-time incident in an otherwise clean \nrecord. He has a stable work record and served honorably for an extended period in our \narmed forces. Despite the positive evidence, Applicant\u2019s actions raise serious concerns \nabout his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct, personal conduct, and financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 6, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), also known as Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nJune 24, 2008\n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n2\nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on \nNovember 26, 2007, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing. One document was attached to the answer.  \n \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 4, 2008, \nwas provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He provided some additional \ninformation which was received by DOHA on April 15, 2008, and admitted without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on May 9, 2008. Additional information was \nsubmitted on June 11 and 19, 2008, and they were admitted without objection. Two \ndocuments were credit reports that were already in the record (Exhs. 6 and 8). Two \nothers were receipts for payments made on two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and d.). The final \ndocument concerned payment of $226 on an account not alleged in the SOR.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR seven of the eight allegations in the \nSOR of financial considerations relating to delinquent debts. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked \nthere since February 2005 as a security officer. He had a motorcycle accident in April \n2003 and sustained injuries resulting in medical expenses and a one-third reduction in \nsalary for the following year before he moved to his present location. Over several years \nin his former employment and a one-year period of unemployment before obtaining his \npresent job, he incurred debts of approximately $20,000 and they have become \ndelinquent. He moved from the west coast where he was employed because of the high \ncost of living and drug crimes near his residence. However, he had difficulty obtaining \nemployment and the expenses they incurred were for moving costs, utilities, a \ncomputer, vehicle repossession, rent, and other living expenses.  \n \n \nApplicant is married with one child. Their daughter has a learning disability and \nrequires full attention so his wife does not now work except as a school aide working \nwith their daughter. They are now able to keep up with present financial obligations but \nnot able to resolve the delinquent debts at issue. They do not have a credit card or an \nautomobile. He commutes to work on a borrowed motorcycle. He has a net income of \n$2,000 per month and, after expenses, has $93 remaining (Exh. 5). He was in the Army \nfor approximately six months in 2001.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n3\nFinancial Considerations \n \n \n Applicant admits to over $18,000 of the $20,000 debts alleged in the SOR. He \ndenies one debt of approximately $1,200 (SOR 1.f.). He is investigating the status of the \ndebt but did not supply any additional information in the response to the FORM. Two of \nthe remaining delinquent debts have been resolved or is being resolved. The smallest is \na utility bill for $54 which has been paid (Exh. B). He has paid $100 (Exh. C) on a $226 \ngarbage bill (SOR \u00b6 1. d.) and is making payments.  He avers that several other debts \nhave been charged off but does not deny that he owes them. The largest single debt is \napproximately $14,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) for an automobile repossession that has not been \npaid.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective\u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n4\n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that Guideline F provides the standard for resolution of the allegations \nset forth in the SOR. It states: \n \nGuideline F Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report (Exh. 6). \nAt least seven of the debts remain unresolved. Only the one for $226 has been proven \nto be partially paid in the amount of $100. The government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19 (c).  \n \n \nFive Mitigating Conditions (MC) are provided under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) in the \nGuideline and have been considered:  \n \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n5\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant provided documentation in his answer and his response to the FORM to \nestablish mitigation for two of the debts. However, his statements concerning his intent to \nmake  payments to creditors are insufficient because he did not provide any proof that \nsuch was being done or his financial ability to do so. While his income appears insufficient \nto materially resolve the debts, he has not act responsibly under the circumstances since \nhe has only resolved two of the smallest debts and admits that he has insufficient \nresources to resolve the others.  Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b620 (a) and (b) do not apply. \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply because there are no clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control, and he did not establish that he acted in \ngood faith to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to his one disputed debt \nbecause he did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n6\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions previously discussed through application of the whole person concept. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations. He has made some progress in \nresolving the smallest debts but currently has substantial unresolved, delinquent debt. \nWhile he admittedly does not have sufficient income in his present circumstances to \nmake much progress resolving the delinquent debt, he has not entered debt counseling \nor taken other steps that would justify applying mitigating conditions.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting \nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

In his reply to the SOR, Applicant admits the Guideline J allegations, but he denies the allegations under Guidelines G and E. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. In May 2000, he was awarded a bachelor of science in electrical engineering technology. He has worked in the defense industry since June 2000. His current position is known as a system and network engineer. His day-to-day work involves supporting a ground-based missile- defense program. His annual salary is about $69,000.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 28, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline J for criminal conduct, Guideline G for alcohol\nconsumption, and Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification of a security-clearance\napplication). For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nApril 10, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on November 28, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on December 26, 2007. The hearing took place as\nscheduled on March 11, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 19, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges six incidents of criminal conduct, five of\nwhich are alcohol-related incidents\u2014driving under the influence (DUI). Under Guideline\nG, the SOR cross-references to the five alcohol-related incidents under Guideline J.\nAnd under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant falsified material facts on a security-\nclearance application because he disclosed only one of his five alcohol-related\nincidents. In his reply to the SOR, Applicant admits the Guideline J allegations, but he\ndenies the allegations under Guidelines G and E. Based on the record evidence as a\nwhole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. In May 2000, he\nwas awarded a bachelor of science in electrical engineering technology. He has worked\nin the defense industry since June 2000. His current position is known as a system and\nnetwork engineer. His day-to-day work involves supporting a ground-based missile-\ndefense program. His annual salary is about $69,000. He is seeking to retain a security\nclearance. He believes he was initially granted a security clearance via his military\nservice in a state national guard unit where he worked with the same missile-defense\nprogram. He served in the guard for six years until his honorable discharge in 2000. \nApplicant has never married, but he describes a woman as his common-law wife\nwith whom he has two children, ages four and six. She is employed outside the home\nas a counselor working with children. \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, which consists primarily of alcohol-\nrelated offenses (Exhibits 2 and 3). He described the incidents in a January 2007\ninterview (Exhibit 2), and the incidents are summarized as follows:\n\u2022\nJanuary 1994\u2013arrested and charged with unlawful breaking and entering of a\nmotor vehicle; case ended in a dismissal or no bill.\n\u2022\nAugust 1998\u2013arrested, charged, and convicted of DUI.\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\n3\n\u2022\nJanuary 1999\u2013arrested, charged, and convicted of DUI.\n\u2022\nJune 1999\u2013arrested and charged with DUI; disposition uncertain. \n\u2022\nMarch 2002\u2013arrested, charged, and convicted of prowling and DUI.\n\u2022\nMay 2003\u2013arrested and charged with DUI; convicted in 2007. \nThe most recent DUI incident is discussed below.\nApplicant was arrested for DUI in May 2003 when he was found sleeping in his\nauto on the side of the road. He had been drinking at his cousin\u2019s house in his\nhometown, which is more than 100 miles from the community where he lives and works.\nAfter leaving his cousin\u2019s house, he decided not to drive, and so he pulled over and\nwent to sleep in the vehicle. The police arrived at some point and arrested him for DUI.\nHe was held in jail overnight and released the next day. \nApplicant says he lost track of the incident for various reasons, such as the\ngeographic distance, moving and changing addresses, etc. (Tr. 52\u201353). He became\naware of an outstanding arrest warrant during the January 2007 interview; the arrest\nwarrant was issued in July 2003 (Exhibit 2). He then took action to have the case\nresolved and it concluded in September or October 2007 when he was convicted of\nDUI. He was fined $815 and placed on two years of probation, which expires in about\nOctober 2009. The probation is supervised and requires him to report to a probation\nofficer periodically. In addition to the conviction and probation, the state revoked his\ndriver\u2019s license for three years. He believes it is revoked until sometime in 2011.  \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in November 2005 (Exhibit\n1). Concerning his police record, Question 23d asked him to answer the following\nquestion: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted or any offense(s) related to\nalcohol or drugs?\u201d He responded affirmatively and disclosed the March 2002 DUI\nincident. He did not disclose any of the other DUI charges and convictions.   \nHe has abstained from alcohol since sometime after his arrest for the 2003 DUI.\nDoing so suits his lifestyle and his health concerns. In 2002, Applicant had successful\nsurgery for brain cancer. As a result, he takes medicine to control seizures and he has\nbeen told by his doctors that he should not drink alcohol. In connection with this\nproceeding, Applicant sought out and participated in a substance-abuse program\n(Exhibit A). He successfully completed the program in January 2008. Applicant has not\nreceived a diagnosis of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\n\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n16\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n17\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n DC 4 is the \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\n18\n5\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n14\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n15\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct.\nIn particular, DC 1,  DC 3,  and DC 4  apply against Applicant as evidenced by his\n16\n17\n18\nmultiple arrests, charges, and convictions for DUI, as well as his status as a probationer\nuntil October 2009. In addition, the gap in time from the May 2003 DUI arrest to the\nconviction more than four years later in 2007 is of some concern. This circumstance\nsuggests a degree of irresponsibility on Applicant\u2019s part. The breaking-and-entering\ncharge in SOR \u00b6 1.f, however, is not much of a concern because the charge was\ndismissed and it appears Applicant may have been at the wrong place at the wrong\ntime. To sum up, the totality of the criminal conduct calls into question Applicant\u2019s\njudgment as well as his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline also contains several conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns, but none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. It is true that his last arrest was nearly\nfive years ago and he quit drinking alcohol the same year. But the 2003 DUI offense\nwas not resolved until 2007, and Applicant is now a probationer until about October\n2009. This means he is now serving a lawful sentence imposed by a state court. This is\na key fact. And it explains why the criminal conduct guideline is being decided against\nApplicant while the alcohol consumption guideline is being decided for Applicant. His\nprobationary status militates against a successful case in reform and rehabilitation. In\nother words, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will serve probation without violation and\nthen go on to be a law-abiding citizen. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against\nApplicant. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 15\u201316 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n19\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 15. \n20\n DC 1 is \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child\n21\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 15.\n22\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n23\nconditions).  \n6\nUnder Guideline G for alcohol consumption,  the security concern is that\n19\n\u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d  \n20\nThe guideline contains several conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying. In general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s pattern of\ndrinking-and-driving. The most pertinent DC concerns alcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work,  which applies against Applicant due to the multiple arrests, charges, and\n21\nconvictions for DUI. Taken together, these facts and circumstances raise questions\nabout Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline also contains four conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThe most pertinent is MC 1, which provides as follows:\nSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.22\nMC 1 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor because nearly five years have passed since the last\nalcohol-related incident. He has abstained from alcohol since sometime in 2003, and he\nis now a family man with a partner to whom he is committed and he is raising two\nchildren with her. Likewise, alcohol consumption is inconsistent with his medical\ncondition and the prescribed medicines he takes for his condition. His excessive\nconsumption of alcohol is in the past, and it no longer casts doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because he has established a pattern of\nabstinence. Accordingly, Guideline G is decided for Applicant. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n23\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n24\n DC 1 is the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n25\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n7\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n24\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about\nit, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 23d in his\nNovember 2005 security-clearance application. It is undisputed that Applicant was\nrequired to report all DUI charges and convictions in response to this question. He did\nnot, reporting only the 2002 DUI incident. He contends that he answered the question in\nthis way because: (1) he was told he only had to list felonies; and (2) he may have\nmisread the question (Tr. 39\u201343, 68\u201371). His testimony is not credible. Given his\nmilitary experience and his experience as an employee in the defense industry, he had\nto know his lengthy record of drunk driving might be a problem for his security\nclearance. He simply understated his record hoping he would pass. Moreover, his\nvarying explanations undermine his credibility. The record evidence is sufficient to\nconclude that Applicant deliberately omitted or falsified material facts when he\nanswered Question 23d by understating his history of alcohol-related offenses.  In\n25\nother words, his answer to Question 23d was at best a half-truth\u2014it was not a full, frank,\nand truthful answer. \nAll of the MC under Guideline E have been reviewed and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making false statements to the federal government during the\nsecurity-clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away,\nextenuated, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nfalsification of the security-clearance application was given great weight, and the case\nwould have been decided against Applicant on this basis alone. Likewise, the whole-\nperson concept (including his honorable military service, the absence of workplace\nmisconduct, and his alcohol-related rehabilitation efforts) was given due consideration\n\n8\nand that analysis does not support a favorable decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

He remained in\nthe U.S., working as a software engineer for several companies before obtaining his\ncurrent position.3\n\nId. at 19-21, 24, 25.\n4\nId. at 23-26; Gov X 5, supra note 3, personal interview.\n5\nGov X 4, supra note 2, at 26-30; Gov X 5, supra note 3, personal interview.\n6\nGov X 5, supra note 3, personal interview.\n7\nGov X 3, supra note 1, at 1; Gov X 4, supra note 2, at 7; Gov E 5, supra note 3, at 2, 5-6, personal interview;\n8\nGov X 7 (Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI)) at 2, 4-5;\nDepartment of State, Consular Information Sheet, dated August 9, 2007.\n3\nApplicant married in April 1995. His wife, who was born in India, became a U.S.\ncitizen in January 1995. They have two children, ages 10 and 8, who were born in the\nU.S. His wife and children reside with him in the U.S. 4\nApplicant\u2019s parents, ages 72 and 68, reside in India, where they were born. His\nfather is a retired university professor and his mother a housewife. Both are citizens of\nIndia. His brother and sister reside in India, where they were born. They are citizens of\nIndia. His brother works for a U.S. company in India and his sister works as an\nelectronics communications engineer in a scientific laboratory for the Indian\ngovernment.5\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law, who were born in India, are\nnaturalized U.S. citizens and reside in the U.S. His sister-in-law, who was born in India,\nlives in the U.S. and is a resident alien, working in the U.S. for a U.S. company.6\nSince arriving in the U.S., Applicant has traveled to India six times to visit with his\nparents and siblings. He talks with his parents regularly by telephone and with his\nsiblings approximately once a month. During this same time, he traveled once to\nCanada on a family trip and once to Ireland on a business trip.7\nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in March 2005 and obtained a U.S. passport\nshortly thereafter. His Indian passport is no longer valid. In May 2005, he acquired a\n\u201cPerson of Indian Origin\u201d card. India provides this card to former citizens and individuals\nwhose father or grandfather are or were citizens of India. This card allows Applicant to\ntravel to India without applying for the entry visa India requires all visitors to have before\nentering the country. Applicant has offered to give this card to his security office to hold\nuntil he needs it for travel. He would provide the security office with details of his trip\nand a contact number while in India before requesting the card. He would return the\ncard upon his return to the U.S. He will not invalidate the card as it makes his travel\npreparations for India easier, which can be important if he must travel quickly. He must\nstill use his U.S. passport when traveling to India. If his visit is less than 180 days, as a\ncard holder, he need not register when he arrives. The card provides no citizenship\nbenefits to him, particularly political rights and voting rights, but allows him to act in the\nsame manner as other visitors. Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he has not participated in\nthe Indian political process.8\n\nGov X 5, supra note 3, Answer to Question 15 and personal interview.\n9\nGov X 5, supra note 3, Answer to Question 16 and personal interview.\n10\n4\nIn July 2005, Applicant opened a non-repatriable account (NRE) at a bank in\nIndia for the sole purpose of providing his parents with money to pay emergency\nexpenses because he has a family responsibility to help his parents. He deposited\n$1,000 in U.S. dollars in the account, which the Indian bank converted into Indian\ncurrency. Only U.S. dollars can be deposited in the account. Once the money is\nconverted into Indian currency, it cannot be converted back into U.S. dollars. The\nmaximum amount of money in the account has been $2,000. In the last year, the\naccount earned approximately $20 in interest. Applicant does not provide his parents\nwith monthly income. His parents own their home and his father receives a monthly\npension. His sister lives with his parents and provides financial assistance to them.9\nApplicant loaned his brother $15,000 to purchase a condominium in India. The\nrecord does not contain any evidence which reflects that Applicant retains an ownership\ninterest in his brother\u2019s condominium. Applicant does own property and other assets in\nthe U.S., which have an estimated value of $630,000.10\nApplicant has never served in the Indian or U.S. military. His finances are stable\nand solid. He does not have a criminal record nor is there evidence of alcohol and drug\nabuse by him. The record does not contain any information which indicates that his\nfamily members in India are political activists or involved in any type of criminal activity.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. India is the largest democratic\ncountry in the world. Like the U.S., India is committed to political freedom protected by a\nrepresentative government. The U.S. and India share a common interest in the free flow\nof commerce and resources, in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable\nAsia. Although the two countries differed over India\u2019s nuclear weapons program and the\npace of economic reforms in India, the U.S. views India as a growing world power with\nwhich it shares common strategic interests. Because of their strong partnership, the\nU.S. and India enjoy a very active working relationship on many issues, including\nterrorism, space, and nuclear weapons. The U.S. has authorized the sales of certain\narms to India. India is a collector of economic information and maintains a positive\nrelations with Iran. The government of India generally respects the rights of its citizens,\nalthough some serious human rights problems remain. The Indian government does not\nsupport or sponsor terrorism or terrorist organizations, but some acts of terrorism have\noccurred within India.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or\nother such benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business\ninterests in another country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\n \nThe Indian government requires all persons visiting India to obtain a visitor\u2019s visa.\nFor former Indian citizens seeking to visit India, the government of India developed the\n\n7\nPerson of Indian Origin card which allows the former citizens to bypass the lengthy\nprocess of obtaining a visa before entering the country. With this card, former citizens\nare not required to register their visit when they arrive in India, unless they stay more\nthan 180 days. The card simplifies the visiting process for former citizens.\nApplicant obtained this card for the sole purpose of making his preparation for\ntrips to India easier, especially if he had to return quickly. The card gives him no rights\nof citizenship, although it allows him to participate in activities in which other visitors\nwould engage. He uses his U.S. passport to travel to and from India, as this is his only\npassport.  The card does not show that Applicant has a preference for India. None of\nthe Guideline C disqualifying conditions are raised. Guideline C is found in favor of\nApplicant.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to\nhelp a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in\nU.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is\nknown to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information;\n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that the\nindividual's access to protected information may involve unacceptable risk to\nnational security;\n\n8\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in\nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation;\n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national;\n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, or\nemployee of a foreign intelligence service;\n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting\nto increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and,\n(I) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the\nindividual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and two siblings are citizens of India and continue to reside in\nIndia. He visits with them periodically and talks with all of them on a regular basis. He\nobtained a Person of Indian Origin card to make his entry into India easier when he\nvisits. He has established a small bank account to assist his parents with financial\nemergencies. His continual and ongoing contacts with his immediate family members\nmay raise security concerns under the disqualifying conditions identified in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)\nand (7)(b).\nApplicant lives with his wife and two young children in the U.S. All are U.S.\ncitizens. Because these family members are in the U.S., he is not at a heightened risk of\nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. Likewise, because his wife\u2019s\nparents are citizens and residents of the U.S. and his sister-in-law works and resides in\nthe U.S. with her closest family members, Applicant\u2019s marriage has not placed him in a\nposition of a heightened risk. Thus, AG \u00b6 7(d) is not raised.\nFor a security concern to be raised under AG \u00b6 7(e), Applicant must have a\nsubstantial business, financial or property interest in India or an Indian owned or\noperated business. He does not. He loaned his brother money to buy a condo in India.\nHe did not buy his brother the condo, thus, Applicant has no ownership in this property.\nHis financial interest is limited to the amount of the loan, and will reduce as the loan is\nrepaid. The bank account he created for his parents contains a very small amount of\nmoney. The account has been established in such a way that it limits how deposits are\nmade, requires the conversion of deposits into Indian currency, and prevents the\nconversion of Indian currency to U.S. dollars. Applicant\u2019s financial transactions in India\ndo not indicate a substantial business or financial interest in India. His minimal actions\n\n9\nand occasional financial support for his family do not raise a security concern,\nparticularly since his financial and property interests in the U.S. are substantial. This\ndisqualifying condition is not raised. \nApplicant worked for a power company operated by the Indian government over\n15 years ago. Since his departure from this job and his immigration to the U.S., he has\nnot had a business relationship with the company or its employees. He does not have\nany regular contact with the company or any of its employees. A security concern is not\nraised by this long ago employment.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation;\n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are\napproved by the cognizant security authority;\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or\norganizations from a foreign country; and,\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used\neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\nIndia is a strong ally of the U.S. It is a democracy with a representative form of\ngovernment. India and the U.S. share many common interests. The countries, however,\ndisagree on certain issues. Currently, the U.S. and India are engaging in dialogue on\nthese issues, which has resulted in important steps towards a resolution of their\ndifferences. Because both countries are democratic countries, their representatives\nunderstand the value of talking and working towards mutual agreement from different\npoints of view. This approach to problem solving fosters mutual respect and trust, which\n\n10\nreduces the likelihood of pressure or coercion from a foreign government on the\nApplicant. The Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings are not involved in politics. His parents\nand brother do not work for the Indian government. His sister\u2019s employment with the\nIndian government is not likely to place him in a position of having to chose between the\ninterests of the U.S. government and India, in part because of the strong relationship\nbetween the U.S. and India. Given his family\u2019s lack of political involvement and criminal\nactivity, it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position to choose between the\ninterests of his family and the U.S. government as provided in AG \u00b6 8(a).\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born and raised in a\ndemocracy. He chose to immigrate to the U.S., the birthplace of democracy. He\ncontinues to hold dear the principles and freedoms found in a democracy. As is natural\nin all human beings, he still maintains ties with his parents and siblings. He feels a\nresponsibility to make a small amount of money available to his parents for\nemergencies. He does not provide them with regular financial support because they\nhave a retirement income and receive financial support from his sister. His family\nmembers are self-sufficient and not in need of financial support from him.  He has never\nbeen arrested or convicted of any criminal charges. He has worked and studied hard.\nHe is a responsible family man and citizen of the U.S. It is unlikely that his continued\ncontacts with his immediate family members in India will create a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the Indian\ngovernment because India is a democracy and a strong friend of the U.S. Applicant has\nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guidelines B and C. \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                               \nMary E. Henry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on August 8, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 25, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 16, 2007, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on December 11, 2007, in San Francisco,\nCalifornia. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 8, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through\nM, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 19,\n\n2\n2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a. and 2.d., and he denied\n1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 58 years old. He is married, and he has three children and one\nstepson. He received a Ph. D. degree in Psychology in 1979.\nApplicant does work for defense contractors, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 5 allegations regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court in 2001 for a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, in which he claimed liabilities of $217,000. His debts were\ndischarged on January 29, 2002. As stated above, Applicant admitted this allegation.\nHe cited several reasons for his financial difficulties, which will be discussed below. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,090.\nApplicant testified that this had been a debt of his, but it was discharged in the\nbankruptcy, cited as 1.a., above. Exhibit C is a letter from Applicant\u2019s former attorney,\nwho filed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy with the court on October 23, 2002. The attorney\nstates that all of Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged on January 29, 2002, and he\nattached a Schedule F, listing all creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims. Since\nCreditor 1 is listed on Schedule F, I therefore find that this debt was discharged in\nbankruptcy in 2002, and Applicant no longer owes this debt. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $11,502.\nApplicant acknowledged that this also had been a debt of his, but it was discharged in\nthe bankruptcy. Exhibit C also lists this debt to Creditor 2 on Schedule F.  I therefore\nfind that this debt was discharged in bankruptcy in 2002, and Applicant no longer owes\nthis debt. \n1.d. This second overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$14,870. Applicant also acknowledged that this had been a debt of his, but it was\ndischarged in the bankruptcy. Exhibit C also lists this second debt to Creditor 2 on\n\n3\nSchedule F.  I therefore find that this debt was discharged in bankruptcy in 2002, and\nApplicant no longer owes this debt.\n1.e. This SOR paragraph alleges that, based on a Personal Financial Statement\nexecuted by Applicant on May 30, 2007, his monthly expenses exceed his monthly\nincome, and this does not even include the debts he owes as alleged in 1.b. through\n1.d. First, as discussed above, Applicant does not owe debts 1.b. through 1.d., as they\nhave been discharged in bankruptcy.  \nApplicant cited several factors for his previous financial difficulties. His first wife\nhad been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. He also had been employed as a counselor\nby a church, which was the primary source of his income. At some point, he\nexperienced a change of outlook and philosophy, and because of this he resigned his\nposition with the church and separated from his wife, both during the same period of\ntime in 1995. His income decreased by 75%, but he continued to support his wife after\nthey separated. Because of his loss of income , his financial situation continued to\ndeteriorate until he filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Applicant\u2019s first marriage also ended in\ndissolution 2001. \nApplicant testified that, together with his current wife who earns approximately\n$90,000, his finances are in very good order and he does not have any overdue debts.\nHe introduced a credit report, dated August 14, 2007, (Exhibit B), which indicates that\nhe has no current delinquent accounts and that his financial score as of July 28, 2007,\nwas 690, which a very good score. He also testified that he purchased a home in 2007\nfor $430,000 with a fixed-rate mortgage of 6.25%, and he stated that he would not have\nreceived such a favorable rate if his finances were not in good order. \nFinally, Applicant  also offered into evidence two letters from individuals who\nknow or have known him for may years in his professional life (Exhibits L and M). One is\nthe president of a company that does background investigations for the United States\nGovernment, and who indicated that Applicant  has performed over 300 investigations\nfor his company. The other is an individual who is a retired Special Agent in Charge with\nthe United States Department of State and now performs background investigations.\nThey spoke in extremely laudatory terms of his high integrity and ability.\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed Security Clearance Application (SCA) on\nFebruary 27, 2003. Question #38 asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question and\nincluded the debts listed as 1.b. through 1.d., in the SOR. As discussed above, these\ndebts had already been discharged in bankruptcy, and he also averred that before the\nbankruptcy was filed he had never been overdue on his debt, so Applicant\u2019s response\nwas correct. \n2.b. Question #39 of the SCA asks,  \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to this question and again listed no debts.\n\n4\nAgain, as these debts had already been discharged in bankruptcy, Applicant\u2019s response\nwas correct. \n2.c. The Government alleges that during an interview with a Department of\nDefense  investigator Applicant stated that he received income as a result of counseling\nas a psychologist. However, he was not authorized to do so, since his license to\npractice as a psychologist had been revoked in August 1999. Applicant testified credibly\nthat since 1999, he has not and does not hold himself out as a licensed psychologist.\nRather he performs therapy as a psychotherapist for which no license is required. He\nalso testified that he had not informed the investigator that he practiced psychology. \nI find no evidence that Applicant engaged in practicing as a license psychologist\nwithout proper authorization. It is far more likely, based on the common substitution of\nterms, that Applicant did say he practiced psychotherapy, and the investigator recorded\nit as psychology. \n2.d. The Government alleges and Applicant has admitted that in October 1995 he\nwas civilly sued by a female client for Sexual Conduct and Inappropriate Behavior,\nwhich resulted in the case being settled out of court, Applicant losing his license to\npractice psychology, and damages being paid by his malpractice carrier in the amount\nof $100,000. Applicant testified that despite the outcome of this case, he was never\ninappropriate with his client. He averred credibly that this incident was fabricated by an\nindividual who wanted to hurt him. He fought the case but without an attorney, which he\nfelt he could not afford at the time, and he was ultimately unsuccessful.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\noccurred beginning in 1995, and were resolved in bankruptcy in 2001. Applicant\u2019s now\nhas his finances in good order and has no overdue debts, so I find that his previous\nadverse financial condition does not cast doubt on his current reliability. \nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from Applicant\u2019s loss of employment and ultimately the\ndissolution of his marriage. Applicant  acted responsibly in continuing to take care of his\nwife who was ill, even after they separated, and ultimately resolving the difficult situation\nin the legally available, although not preferred method of bankruptcy. l I find this\npotentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \n Applicant is now more financially sound and better prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nGUIDELINE E, PERSONAL CONDUCT\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhile AG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, I find that none apply in this case. First as discussed above, Applicant\u2019s\nrepresentations regarding his finances on questions 38 and 39 of the SCA that he\ncompleted were in fact correct. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s testimony that he has not held\nhimself out as a licensed psychologist, but rather he simply practiced psychotherapy,\nwhich he is entitled to do.  Finally, It is unclear what actually happened during the\nincident alleged in 2.d., above,  but since more than 12 years has elapsed since this\nevent, and this is the only evidence that has been introduced of misconduct against\nApplicant, I do not find this allegation to be of security concern.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s reasons for his previous\nfinancial difficulties, his excellent economic condition today, and current his positive\nstatus, I find that the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJanuary 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 2,\n2005.  On August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 27, 2007, and requested\nan Administrative Determination by an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 30, 2007.  The Applicant\nresponded to the FORM (Response) on December 18, 2007.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 27, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in all the Subparagraphs, with explanations.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant\u2019s past due debts were caused, in part, by a stroke the Applicant\nsuffered in 1996, and by his subsequent paralysis (Response at page 2).  The Applicant\nnow has a positive monthly cash flow of about $673 (Government Exhibit (GX) 3 at\npage 21)\n1.a.  The Applicant was indebted to creditor #1 in the amount of about $358 (GX\n7 at page 7).  On September 4, 2007, the creditor agreed to a settlement of this debt for\n\u201c50% of the balance\u201d (GX 3 at page 9).  On September 17, 2007, the Applicant paid\n$186 in settlement of this debt (GX 3 at page 7).  An October 2007 Credit Report (CR),\nthat post dates the issuance of the SOR, now lists this debt as \u201cPAID COLLECTION\u201d\n(GX 8 at page 3).  I find this debt has been settled.\n1.b.  The Applicant was indebted to creditor #2 in the amount of about $639 (GX\n5 at page 5).  In his answer to the SOR, the Applicant avers that this debt was settled\nfor $497 (GX 3 at page 3).  On September 17, 2007, the Applicant paid $497 towards\nthis debt, but it is unclear if this debt has been settled to the satisfaction of the creditor\n(GX 3 at page 6).  The October 2007 CR still lists this debt as \u201cUNPAID\u201d (GX 8 at page\n1).\n1.c.  The Applicant was indebted to creditor #3 in the amount of about $2,488\n(GX 7 at page 7).  In his answer to the SOR, the Applicant avers that this debt was\nsettled for $1,340 (GX 3 at page 3).  The Applicant has also submitted a \u201cCASHIER\u201dS\nCHECK\u201d drawn to the creditor in that amount (GX 3 at page 10).  According to the\nOctober 2007 CR, the remaining balance has been \u201cCHARGED OFF,\u201d and the\n\u201cACCOUNT CLOSED BY THE CREDIT GRANTER\u201d (GX 8 at page 2).  I find this debt\nhas been settled.\n1.d.  The Applicant was indebted to creditor #4 (the Social Security\nAdministration (SSA)) in the amount of about $15,580, for overpayment of disability\nbenefits (GX 7 at page 7, and Response at page 1).  On September 14, 2007, the\nApplicant has contacted the SSA, and requested that he make monthly payments of\n$100, in lieu a one lump payment (GX 3 at pages 16~26).  The SSA has not yet\nresponded to this request; and as such, this debt is still outstanding.\n\nThe Government alleges that the past due amount is $3,007, but this is not supported\n1\nby the evidence cited by the Government.  GX 5 at page at page 4 notes $55 past due. \nGX 6 at page 2 notes $2,488 past due as noted above.  GX 7 at page 7 notes $0 as\npast due, and GX 8 at page 2 notes $1,258 as past due.\n3\n1.e.  The Applicant was indebted to creditor #5 in the amount of about $2,4881\n(GX 6 at page 2).  This account is listed as \u201cTRANSFERRED OR SOLD\u201d (Id).  It\nappears to have been sold to creditor #3.  I find this debt has been settled.\n1.f.  The Applicant was indebted to creditor #6 in the amount of about $181 (GX 7\nat page 7).  In his answer to the SOR, the Applicant avers this debt has been paid (GX\n3 at page 3).  This is corroborated by a letter from this creditor (GX 3 at page 8).  I find\nthis debt has been paid.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n4\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG Subparagraph19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG Subaragraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  These are countered, however, by\nSubparagraph 20(b), as \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,. . . unexpected medical emergency . . .), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@  As noted above, the\nApplicant suffered a stroke in 1996, with subsequent paralysis.\nMore importantly, AG Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.@ Here, the Applicant either paid, settled, or offered corroborating\nevidence that he has settled, all but one of the alleged past due debts.  Only the SSA\noverpayment has not been settled, but the Applicant is making a good faith effort to set\nup a monthly payment plan.  Applicant has a positive monthly cash flow of nearly $700;\nand as such, can reasonably address a counter offer from the SSA.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Subparagraph 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\n\n5\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG Subparapraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHere, the Applicant is addressing the Government\u2019s financial concerns as best\nhe can.  He has ignored none of the alleged past due debts, and has paid or settled all\nbut one.  He is only waiting for the SSA to respond to his payment plan offer.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his Financial\nConsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nRICHARD A. CEFOLA\nAdministrative Judge\n",
