He failed to take any action to resolve most of the\ndebts listed in the Statement of Reasons (SOR), and his testimony and the evidence he\npresented gives little reason to anticipate he will resolve those debts in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nOn November 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR, dated December 8, 2008, admitted all SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 15, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on February 25, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued\non April 2, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 27, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified, called one witness, and submitted 6 documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript\nwas received on May 5, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 35-year-old man who has been employed as a senior communications\nequipment analyst by a defense contractor since October 2002. From July 2002 through\nSeptember 2002, he worked for this same employer through placement by a staffing\nagency. Applicant\u2019s manager testified he has known Applicant since October 2004, and\nhas continuing and regular contact with him. In his opinion, Applicant is an outstanding and\ninnovative technician who is reliable and trustworthy. He is confident Applicant has the\nability to safeguard classified information.  \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1992, and he attended a technical school\nfrom November 1992 to July 1994. He did not graduate from the technical school. \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on October 29, 2007, in which he listed his employment history prior to working for\nthe defense contractor as follows: 09/2001 to 06/2002 - customer service through a staffing\nagency; 08/2001 to 08/2001 - unemployment; 07/2001 to 07/2001 - computer technician\nthrough a staffing agency; 06/2001 to 06/2001 - factory worker through a staffing agency;\n05/2001 to 05/2001 - unemployment; 02/2001 to 04/2001 - sales representative for a\nsecurity alarm service; 06/1999 to 01/2001 - regional sales representative for a computer\ncompany; and 11/94 to 06/1999 - service technician for a systems company. Applicant also\ndisclosed in the e-QIP that he left the job with the security alarm service due to an\nallegation of unsatisfactory performance.\nApplicant has been married since September 1998. Two children have been born\nof this marriage, ages ten and four. Applicant also has two children, ages 11 and 15, from\nan earlier relationship. His wages are garnished about $650 per month for child support\nand to liquidate a child support arrearage. \n \nApplicant attributes the beginning of his financial problems to his loss of\nemployment as a sales representative in January 2001. He testified he was earning about\n$60,000 annually from that job and his income declined considerably thereafter. (Tr. 72)\nHis work history from January 2001 to October 2002,  as evidenced by the information\ncontained in the e-QIP, fully corroborates that testimony.\n\n3\nApplicant testified his finances were further strained when he and his wife separated\nfor a period of time in 2003, due to the increased expenses of maintaining two households\non their combined incomes. Following their reconciliation and into 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife\nwas mobilized by the military reserve and stationed in the United States, but away from\nhome, for eighteen months. The record does not establish what loss of income, if any, they\nexperienced as a result of her military service. However, she currently works as a licensed\npractical nurse (LPN), earning about $18 an hour, and serves as a corporal/specialist\n(paygrade E-4) in the reserve, making it very likely that there was a loss of income while\nshe was activated. Finally, Applicant experienced a number of unplanned for emergency\nexpenses in the past several years. \nApplicant\u2019s current net pay is about $2,400 per month. His wife works weekends and\nher net monthly pay varies from about $1,400 to $1,990. According to Applicant, she also\nearns about $180 per month from the reserves. However, her earning statement, dated\nJuly 23, 2008, listed her net pay as $51.41, due in part to a thrift savings plan loan\nrepayment in the amount of $75.38. (GE 4) Applicant testified that after payment of his\nmortgage, recurring monthly expenses, and payments on three debts, his monthly\ndiscretionary income is about $540. \nApplicant submitted proof that he has fully satisfied the $803 collection debt listed\nin SOR subparagraph 1.c with the payment of the negotiated settlement sum of $166.91.\nHe has also satisfied the collection accounts listed in subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f, which had\nbeen owing in the combined amount of $186, by making payment-in-full. All three of these\naccounts were paid in March 2009.\nApplicant testified the $530 collection account listed in subparagraph 1.b arose from\nthe non-payment of the last month of cable service and the failure to return the cable box.\nHe admits he still has the cable box and that he did not pay for the last month of service,\nbut claims he cannot return the box or pay for the service because of the transfer of the\naccount to a collection agency and the sale of the original cable provider to another\ncompany.\nApplicant admits he is responsible for the other six collection accounts, owing in the\ntotal amount of $16,261, and that he has not taken any action to resolve any of them. Each\nof these debts are for medical expenses. Applicant testified the majority of this debt was\nincurred when he experienced a serious medical emergency while he was either\nunemployed or employed without insurance. When Department Counsel asked Applicant\nif he had contacted his creditors, Applicant testified as follows:\nI\u2019ve talked to just about all the creditors at any given point. Whether I contact\nthem or they contact me. And when we discuss the account, if I have money\nI will try to pay something and if they - - you know, they\u2019ve tried to enter into\nsome kind of financial arrangement. And with the other debt that I have, the\nother payments that I have, I just basically say I don\u2019t have anything, I can\u2019t\ncommit to anything right now. I will pay you as much as I can when I can.

They also disclose the purchase\nof a video game at the cost of $102.20. When Applicant was asked why, considering the\npending hearing on the SOR, he and/or his wife weren\u2019t willing to cut back on these type\nexpenses to at least satisfy some of the smaller debts listed in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s only\nresponse was: \u201cI don\u2019t have a good answer for that because I absolutely see your point and\nI respect it.\u201d (Tr. 79)          \n   \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id. at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n5\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nThe SOR alleges 10 accounts that were submitted for collection, owing in the\ncombined amount of $17,780. Each of these accounts had been delinquent for at least a\ncouple of years to as much as eight years. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems commenced when he lost a higher paying job in\nJanuary 2001. He spent the next year and a half working at a variety of temporary positions\nthat were interrupted by two briefs periods of unemployment. His financial problems were\ncompounded by a marital separation and, in all likelihood, by his wife\u2019s activation by the\nmilitary reserve. Additionally, the greatest portion of his delinquent debt is due to a medical\nemergency he suffered in either 2001/02 while he was uninsured.\nApplicant has been continuously employed by his present employer since October\n2002. All of the significant problems to which he attributes his delinquent accounts were\nresolved about four years ago. He has had contact with his delinquent creditors, but he did\nnothing to resolve any of the debts listed in the SOR until March 2009, four months after\nissuance of the SOR. \nApplicant satisfied one creditor, owed $803, with a payment of $166.91. He satisfied\ntwo other creditors, owed a total of $186, with payment-in-full. However, he has taken no\naction to satisfy six creditors, owed a total of $16,261. As to the last outstanding debt\nlisted in the SOR, Applicant is unable to return the cable box due to the passage of time.\nThe collection agency is seeking payment as opposed to a return of the merchandise, and\nApplicant has done nothing to satisfy the debt.\n\n6\nThe 22 restaurant visits and game purchase disclosed in Applicant\u2019s bank statement\nwould not normally be considered inappropriate. However, considering the long-standing\ndelinquent debt and the pendency of the SOR, spending disposable income in that fashion\nexhibits a lack of judgment and continuing financial irresponsibility.    \nBased on the above, I find Applicant has not acted responsibly since the problems\nthat created his delinquent accounts were resolved. He continues to exhibit financial\nirresponsibility and poor judgment in resolving his delinquent debt. Waiting until four\nmonths after issuance of the SOR, and then satisfying only a few of the smaller debts that\nwere owing, especially in consideration of the discretionary income Applicant testified was\navailable to him, does not exhibit a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors.\n  \nAccordingly, I conclude Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c): .\n. . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC\n20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts do not apply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him nor\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e & f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g - j:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 6, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 25, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether Applicant is entitled to a clearance\nunder the doctrine of reciprocity; whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were supported by\nsubstantial record evidence; whether the Judge failed to consider record evidence favorable to\nApplicant; whether the Judge erred in his application of the mitigating conditions; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s whole-person analysis was in error.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\ndecision of the Judge.  \nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant as an unmarried\nemployee of a Defense contractor.  He has a college degree, a law degree, and a graduate law degree\nfrom a European university.  \nBorn in Iran, Applicant immigrated with his family to this country in the early 1980s.  He\nbecame a U.S. citizen in the early 2000s.  He has lived here continuously, except for a year studying\nabroad.  His mother, father, and sibling are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran, as is Applicant.  They\nlive in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s grandmother, aunt, and uncle are citizens and residents of Iran.\nApplicant\u2019s only contact with them is to speak with his grandmother on the telephone approximately\nevery six months.\nApplicant had an Iranian passport at the time he became a U.S. citizen.  It finally expired in\nthe late 2000s, after which he obtained another one.  He used this new passport for travel to Iran.\nApplicant held on to his passport for nine months after the hearing before turning it over to the\ncontrol of his security officer.  \nApplicant stands to inherit some property in Iran.  He advised the clearance investigator that\nhe did not want to renounce his Iranian citizenship due to this possibility of inheritance.  \nThe Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) granted Applicant a security\nclearance in the late 2000s.  Based on that determination, another Government agency granted\nApplicant a clearance soon after.  Applicant made his most recent trip to Iran using his Iranian\npassport after that agency\u2019s grant of a clearance.  \nIran and the U.S. have not had diplomatic relations since 1980.  Iran is attempting to obtain\nweapons of mass destruction; it supports international terrorism; it supports violent opposition to\nthe Mideast peace process; and intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq.  The U.S. considers Iran the\nmost active state sponsor of terrorism.  It provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups.   \nDiscussion\nDoD 5220.22M (the \u201cNISPOM\u201d) \u00a7 2-204 governs reciprocity.  It provides, in pertinent part:\nAny previously granted [clearance] that is based upon a current investigation of a\nscope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the clearance required shall provide\nthe basis for issuance of a new clearance without further investigation or\n\n1Furthermore, Hearing Exhibit 3 states that the other agency did not conduct an investigation of its own, having\nrelied on the prior grant by DISCO. \nadjudication, unless significant derogatory information that was not previously\nadjudicated becomes known to the granting agency.  \nApplicant\u2019s having applied for an Iranian passport and having used it for travel to Iran\nconstitute \u201csignificant derogatory information\u201d not available to the other Government agency.1\nAccordingly, Applicant is not entitled to reciprocity.  \nWe examine a Judge\u2019s findings to determine if they are supported by substantial record\nevidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d) In this case, the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial\nevidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the\nrecord.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nsustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence, e.g., his\nlanguage skills, evidence that he does not intend to return to Iran, and the speculative nature of his\nlikelihood of inheriting property in Iran.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence\nin the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case 09-01735 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2010). There is nothing in\nApplicant\u2019s presentation on appeal or in the Decision to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence.  \nWe have considered the Decision in light of the record as a whole.  Applicant\u2019s Iranian\nrelatives, including those who reside in Iran; his possibility of inheriting property in Iran; his\npossession and use of an Iranian passport after having obtained U.S. citizenship; and the Judge\u2019s\nfindings about the dilatory circumstances of Applicant\u2019s surrender of that passport cumulatively\nsupport the Judge\u2019s adverse decision.  Applicant is correct that the Directive does not specify a\nperiod of time during which an applicant must relinquish a passport.  In this case, however, the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s nine-month delay between the date of the hearing and his\nrelinquishment of the passport undermined his efforts to mitigate the Guideline C concerns is\nsustainable.\nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

    "discussion": ", we affirm the decision of the Judge. Facts The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant as an unmarried employee of a Defense contractor. He has a college degree, a law degree, and a graduate law degree from a European university. Born in Iran, Applicant immigrated with his family to this country in the early 1980s. He became a U.S. citizen in the early 2000s. He has lived here continuously, except for a year studying abroad. His mother, father, and sibling are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran, as is Applicant. They live in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s grandmother, aunt, and uncle are citizens and residents of Iran. Applicant\u2019s only contact with them is to speak with his grandmother on the telephone approximately every six months. Applicant had an Iranian passport at the time he became a U.S. citizen. It finally expired in the late 2000s, after which he obtained another one. He used this new passport for travel to Iran. Applicant held on to his passport for nine months after the hearing before turning it over to the control of his security officer. Applicant stands to inherit some property in Iran. He advised the clearance investigator that he did not want to renounce his Iranian citizenship due to this possibility of inheritance. The Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) granted Applicant a security clearance in the late 2000s. Based on that determination, another Government agency granted Applicant a clearance soon after. Applicant made his most recent trip to Iran using his Iranian passport after that agency\u2019s grant of a clearance. Iran and the U.S. have not had diplomatic relations since 1980. Iran is attempting to obtain weapons of mass destruction; it supports international terrorism; it supports violent opposition to the Mideast peace process; and intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq. The U.S. considers Iran the most active state sponsor of terrorism. It provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. Discussion DoD 5220.22M (the \u201cNISPOM\u201d) \u00a7 2-204 governs reciprocity. It provides, in pertinent part: Any previously granted [clearance] that is based upon a current investigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the clearance required shall provide the basis for issuance of a new clearance without further investigation or 1Furthermore, Hearing Exhibit 3 states that the other agency did not conduct an investigation of its own, having relied on the prior grant by DISCO. adjudication, unless significant derogatory information that was not previously adjudicated becomes known to the granting agency. Applicant\u2019s having applied for an Iranian passport and having used it for travel to Iran constitute \u201csignificant derogatory information\u201d not available to the other Government agency.1 Accordingly, Applicant is not entitled to reciprocity. We examine a Judge\u2019s findings to determine if they are supported by substantial record evidence. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn August 9, 2007, Applicant submitted his security clearance application (SF \n86). On August 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nC (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 17, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on December 2, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 2, 2009, setting the hearing for \nDecember 16, 2009. \n \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on December 16, 2009. Applicant waived \nthe 15 day notice requirement in the Directive. (Tr. 11)  \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without \nobjection. Under the general designation of Exhibit 6, 16 documents were also received \ninto evidence pursuant to the Government\u2019s request that I take administrative notice of \ninformation relating to Iran. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through CC, \nwhich were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJanuary 5, 2010. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit copies \nof his exhibits.  \n \n I also kept the record open to receive any information on the reciprocity issue of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance issued by another government agency. (Tr. 11-13) If the \nclearance existed, DOHA may have to issue a clearance pursuant to the reciprocity \nprovisions of the NISPOM Section 2-204. The Government submitted that information \non July 14, 2010. Applicant responded to the proffer on August 4, 2010. The \nGovernment submitted rebuttal information on August 5, 2010. I marked those \ndocuments as Hearing Exhibits 1-3. The record closed on August 6, 2010. I reopened \nthe record on August 12 and 13, 2010, to obtain the current status of the Iranian \npassport Applicant had. I received an email from Applicant and his security officer on \nAugust 13, 2010, with information on the passport. I marked that document as Hearing \nExhibit 4. The government did not object to that document. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. (Tr. 21) The request and the attached documents were \nadmitted into evidence as Exhibit 6. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations the SOR, \nwith explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He is unmarried. Applicant has a college degree, a law \ndegree, and a graduate law degree from a Belgian university. He works for a defense \ncontractor. He was born in Iran in 1977. His family immigrated to the United States in \n1983 when Applicant was six years old. Since then, he has lived in the United States \ncontinuously except for his year in Belgium studying law, and two trips to Iran in 2000 \nand 2009. (Tr. 47-52, 60, 70; Exhibits 1, 3, 5, R-T) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, and brother live in the United States. His brother \nworks for a private company in the United States.  His parents are retired and living in \nthe United States. They are all naturalized U.S. citizens, as is Applicant. They are also \ndual citizens with Iran because Iranian law does not recognize the renunciation of that \ncitizenship. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2000. (Tr. 53, 70-72; \nExhibits 1-5) \n \nApplicant had an Iranian passport issued before Applicant became a U.S. citizen. \nIt was issued in 1998 and expired in May 2004, and was extended to June 2, 2008. \nAfter he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000, Applicant retained that passport until \nit expired. In 2008 Applicant signed an application for an Iranian passport given to him \nby his father. His father prepared and processed the necessary paperwork with the \nIranian government to renew Applicant\u2019s passport. The passport was issued in January \n2009 and is valid until 2014. Applicant\u2019s passport was until August 12, 2010, in his \nparent\u2019s safe deposit box or in Applicant\u2019s possession at his home. Applicant\u2019s parents \nand brother obtained Iranian passports at the same time. Applicant used the earlier \npassport to travel to Iran in the summer of 2000 to visit his father\u2019s mother after he \nbecame a U.S. citizen in January 2000. They used the newly issued Iranian passports \nto visit the father\u2019s mother in 2009 in Iran. Both visits lasted about three weeks and were \nfamily visits only. Applicant\u2019s parents and brother went at the same time. Applicant\u2019s \ngrandmother, aunt and uncle, all of whom are his father\u2019s relatives, live in Iran and are \ncitizens of that country. His grandmother is 95 years old. The Iranian passport is used \nbecause entry into Iran is easier with it. Iranian law does not recognize dual citizenship \nand requires the use of the Iranian passport. (Tr. 52-57, 61-66, 74, 76; Exhibits 1-5, L, \nHearing Exhibit 4)  \n \nApplicant is not certain what property he might inherit in Iran from his father. His \nfather will inherit from his mother. Applicant told the government investigator on January \n31, 2008, he did not want to renounce his Iranian citizenship at that time because of his \ninheritance potential. Applicant\u2019s aunt is retired and has some land near the Caspian \nSea in Iran. Applicant\u2019s uncle is an engineering consultant. No one works for the Iranian \nGovernment. Applicant does not maintain any regular contact with his Iranian relatives \nexcept to call his grandmother every six months. (Tr. 61-66; Exhibit 3) \n \nApplicant would be willing to destroy his Iranian passport to obtain a security \nclearance. He has never voted in an Iranian election. He has not served in the Iranian \nmilitary and has an exemption from service that his father arranged. Applicant does not \nintend to renew his passport. He has no present plans to travel again to Iran or strong \ninterest in returning there. On August 12, 2010, I requested an update on the location of \nthe Iranian passport. Applicant responded on August 13, 2010, that this passport was in \nhis possession. Later in the day his security officer emailed that he now had control of \nthe passport in his office. Applicant had nine months from the date of the hearing to \nsurrender or destroy his Iranian passport and did not do so. (Tr. 55-59, 68, 76, Hearing \nExhibit 4) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant submitted letters of support for his clearance based on his skills \nneeded by his employer. He submitted two employee evaluations showing he meets or \nexceeds expectations. Applicant included two \u201coutstanding performance reward\u201d \ncertificates. (Exhibits M to V) \n \nApplicant proclaimed his loyalty to the U.S. He does not have any financial \ninterests outside the U.S. He asserts he has no direct or strong ties to anyone in Iran. \nHis life since the age of six years has been spent in the United States with his family. \n(Tr. 70, 76)  \n \nApplicant received a secret security clearance in February 2007. That clearance \nwas granted by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office. Based on that \nclearance, another agency granted Applicant a secret security clearance in February \n2007. Pursuant to National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) \nSection 2-204, the Department of Defense is not required to grant a reciprocal security \nclearance based on the other agency\u2019s clearance granted to Applicant. A year after \nobtaining his security clearance he applied for a new Iranian passport. (Hearing Exhibits \n1-3) \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Iran: \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. 1 \n \nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n(1) Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; \n(2) Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; (3) Its support for violent \nopposition to the Middle East peace process; (4) Its dismal human rights record; and (5) \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.2 The U.S. has designated and \ncharacterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical \nsupport to non-state terrorist groups.3 \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \n \n1 U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Iran, dated March 2008 and 2009. \n \n2 Id.  \n \n3U.S. Department of State, State Sponsors of Terrorism, April 30, 2009, and December 14, 2009.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.4  \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens, who were born in Iran and are the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter and depart Iran using their \nU.S. passports; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or \ndeparture. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian \ngovernment. Iranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. \nHotel rooms, telephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal \npossessions in hotel rooms be searched.5 (Exhibit 6, E, W-BB) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n \n4U. S. Department of State, 2009 Human Rights Report: Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices, dated February 25, 2009.  \n \n5 U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Iran, dated July 1, 2009. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference \nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone \nto provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests \nof the United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.  Two conditions apply: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \n \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \n \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country. \n \n Applicant was born in Iran. He obtained an Iranian passport before he became a \nU.S. citizen in 2000. That passport was extended in 2004 until 2008. He obtained \nanother Iranian passport in 2009 that expires in 2014. That passport was in the \n\n \n7 \n \n \npossession of his parents in their safe deposit box until August 13, 2010. It is now in the \npossession of his security officer. AG \u00b6 10 (a) 1 applies. \n \nApplicant renewed his Iranian passport at his father\u2019s request to make it easier \nfor him to enter Iran to visit his father\u2019s family. He did so voluntarily after obtaining U.S. \ncitizenship and he used the passport in 2009 after being granted a security clearance. It \nalso allows Applicant to protect any property or financial interests he may have in \nproperty his grandmother, aunt and uncle own. AG \u00b6 10 (a) 5 applies.  \n \nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualification, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to establish any appropriate mitigating condition. AG \u00b6 11 provides four \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in \na foreign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or \nwhen the individual was a minor; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \n Applicant was born in Iran. His citizenship is derived from that circumstance. His \ndual citizenship is based on the Iranian law that does not allow Iranian citizens to \nrenounce their citizenship after obtaining citizenship in another country. He had an \nIranian passport before becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000. AG \u00b6 11(a) applies and AG \u00b6 \n11(c) partially applies for actions done before Applicant became a U.S. citizen. It does \nnot apply to actions after 2000 when Applicant became a U.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant recently expressed a willingness to relinquish his Iranian passport, if it \nwere necessary for him to do so to obtain a security clearance and maintain his \nemployment. He did not state he would renounce the Iranian citizenship although he \nadmitted he was an Iranian citizen at the same time he became a U.S. citizenship and \nhad a security clearance. AG \u00b6 11(b) does not apply. AG \u00b6 11(e) does not apply \nbecause Applicant did not surrender his passport to his security officer, having left it in \nhis parents\u2019 safe deposit box, until August 13, 2010. Applicant showed his preference \nfor his Iranian passport, and access to that country, on the passport by doing nothing for \nnine months after his hearing. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;6 and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s two trips, in 2000 and 2009, coupled with the Iranian government\u2019s \nanti-American actions and statements, give rise to security concerns that if Applicant \n \n6 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative \nlives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result \nin the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhad access to classified information he could be subject to a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by the Iranian authorities. \nApplicant had access to classified information after he received a security clearance in \n2007. He travelled to Iran in 2009 while having that security clearance. AG \u00b6 7 (a) and \n(b) apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and brother are dual citizens of the United States and Iran, as \nis Applicant. They live in the United States. His grandmother, aunt, and uncle live in Iran \nand are Iranian citizens. Their presence in Iran and Applicant\u2019s work in the U.S. could \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by \nIranian authorities based on their past human rights violations. The Iranian authorities \ncould pressure Applicant\u2019s relatives to get Applicant to disclose classified information to \nkeep them safe from criminal penalties or harassment by the Iranian authorities. AG \u00b6 \n7(d) applies.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s possibility of inheritance from his father of property currently owned \nby his grandmother, aunt, and uncle are financial interests in Iran. Applicant wants to \nprotect that inheritance possibility. Applicant could be subject to foreign influence or \nexploitation to protect his inheritance. AG \u00b6 7(e) applies. \n \nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualification, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to establish any appropriate mitigating condition. AG \u00b6 8 provides conditions \nthat could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nIran\u2019s bellicose statements and actions in recent years, and the lack of diplomatic \nrelations with the U.S., are a security concern when Applicant traveled there in 2009. \nApplicant argues that his grandmother is 95 years old and his aunt and uncle are not \ninvolved with the Iranian government. Then Applicant asserts he has only made two \ntrips in nine years to Iran to visit those family members. He speaks with his grandmother \nonly every six months. He does not communicate with his aunt and uncle. These \nconnections are encouraged by Applicant\u2019s father, who arranged for a renewal of \nApplicant\u2019s Iranian passport and who kept the passport in his safe deposit box. His \nfather is driving this continued Iranian connection.  \n \n \nHowever, Applicant is an educated professional capable of making his own \ndecisions. He exercised very poor judgment after becoming a U.S. citizen and obtaining \na security clearance by then renewing his Iranian passport and traveling to Iran in 2009. \nWhile Applicant does not intend to renew the passport in 2014, and has no plans to visit \nIran again, he took no action to destroy the passport after he received the SOR in \nAugust 2009. It is likely Applicant will be placed in a position to choose between the \ninterests of the United States, Iran, and his family. AG \u00b6 8 (a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant came to the United States at six years of age. He has lived here \ncontinuously, except for one year of education in Belgium. His family is here and his \nparents retired from jobs in the United States. His brother lives and works in the United \nStates. They are all naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant has a long-standing relationship \nwith the United States. This country is the only one he really knows because he grew up \nhere. His familial connections in Iran are severely periodic and likely to end when his \naged grandmother dies. They are very minimal associations with those family members. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply because Applicant shows a preference for Iran after becoming \na U.S. citizen and getting a security clearance so he could work for a defense contractor \nand have access to classified information.  \n \n \nApplicant has infrequent contacts with his grandmother in Iran beyond two visits \nand semi-annual telephone calls. He has no contacts with his aunt and uncle in Iran. He \nonly made two trips with his family to Iran in the past ten years. Those contacts are \ncasual and infrequent. But Applicant has made two trips to Iran specifically to visit his \ngrandmother. AG \u00b6 8(c) applies partially. But it is so slight it cannot control this \ndetermination. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s possibility of inheriting property in Iran is unknown. His father will \ninherit first when Applicant\u2019s grandmother dies. The father could sell the property before \nhe dies. The possibility of Applicant inheriting is slight but it might result in a conflict of \ninterest for Applicant. AG \u00b6 8 (f) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \n\n \n11 \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole person concept.   \n      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. There is a significant risk of terrorism \nand human rights abuses in Iran. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are \nhostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists could \nattempt to use Applicant\u2019s grandmother, aunt and uncle to obtain such information. But \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with these three people is so slight that the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is virtually nonexistent. Applicant only made \ntwo trips within a decade to Iran for a total time of six weeks in country. His travels are \ninfrequent and motivated by his father\u2019s desires to have the family visit his mother in \nIran. Applicant did not initiate these trips.  \n \nApplicant has been in the United States for the past 26 years. He grew up here \nand obtained his education here. He became a U.S. citizen in 2000. His connection to \nthe United States is deep and strong. Applicant has no relationship with Iran outside his \nfather\u2019s family members. Applicant declared he will not renew his Iranian passport and \ndoes not have plans to travel again to Iran. His inheritance possibility of some property \nin Iran is minimal. However, Applicant exercised very poor judgment by expressing a \npreference for Iran by obtaining a new Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, \nand more importantly, being granted a security clearance so he could work with \nclassified information in the employ of a defense contractor. He also exercised poor \njudgment retaining his Iranian passport for nine months after the hearing while knowing \nit was a security concern to the government.    \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the foreign preference and foreign influence security \nconcerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against \nApplicant because of his poor judgment regarding his connections to Iran.  \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.1: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.2: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.3: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.4: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 24, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\n2\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 27, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had been employed in the communications industry,\nsuffering unemployment when his business failed.  He started up another company, which installed\nwireless communication technology.  He was current on his bills until this business faltered in 2007.\nAfter that he became delinquent on many of his bills.\nHe subsequently began working for a defense contractor but was laid off.  He has held a\nvariety of jobs since, including driving a taxicab.  He has experienced a 90 % drop in income.  In\naddition to his employment difficulties, his daughter has \u201cmajor medical issues.\u201d  Decision at 3.  \nAs stated above, Applicant has had several delinquent debts in the recent past.  Two of the\nlargest, for taxes owed the federal government and the state, have been resolved.  He has paid off\nother debts, but he has three outstanding, which total in excess of $17,000.  His principal source of\nincome at the present time is unemployment benefits.  \nApplicant has engaged the services of a credit counseling agency.  This agency has devised\na debt repayment plan.  \u201cHis financial counselors advised that he would be able to increase his\nmonthly payments once he returned to work.\u201d  Id. at 4.  \nApplicant has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Therefore, they are not at issue\nin this appeal.  \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\n\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FCMC) 20(b), Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201c[T]he conditions that\n1\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances[.]\u201d\n3\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nwere rooted in circumstances outside his control, that he had paid off some of his debts, and that he\nwas making payments on others.  \u201cBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are\nsufficient to establish some extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations.  As\na result, MC \u00b6 20(b) . . . has some application to Applicant\u2019s circumstances.\u201d  Decision at 7.   The\n1\nJudge stated, however, that Applicant has not been able to estimate when he will be able to pay off\nhis remaining debts without a full time job.  Applicant\u2019s \u201cdocumented payments and payment\nagreements with individual creditors and a debt consolidation firm are encouraging but not enough\nat this time to warrant full application of any of the mitigating conditions covered in the financial\nguideline.\u201d  Id.   \nThe Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion under FCMC 20(b) appears to rest on a view that Applicant\nhas not demonstrated responsible behavior with regard to his debts.  While the Judge noted\nApplicant\u2019s repayment efforts and his having secured the services of a credit counseling agency, he\nseems to have concluded that the extent of Applicant\u2019s remaining debts, viewed in light of his\nprecarious employment situation, are such that it will be a long time at best before he has paid them\nall off.  However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor\nto develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously.  All that is required is that\nan applicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment,\naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate\nthe plan.  See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \nWhat constitutes the responsible behavior contemplated by FCMC 20(b) depends on the facts\nof a given case.  In the circumstances at issue here, the Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s poor\n\n4\nfinancial condition originated in job losses and his daughter\u2019s medical problems, both of which were\noutside his control.  In light of the Judge\u2019s findings, Applicant appears to have acted responsibly\ngiven his limited resources in that he has addressed his financial problems by (1) resolving some of\nthe debts, including the two largest, the tax liens, (2) developing a repayment plan for the remaining\ncreditors, and (3) taking reasonable actions to effectuate the plan.  The Judge\u2019s decision noted that\nApplicant\u2019s primary source of income is his unemployment benefits and that he does not have\nsubstantial assets that could be converted to cash for debt repayment at this time.  But the Judge has\nnot explained what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the circumstances\nthat he has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or why the approach taken by\nApplicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in light of his limited circumstances.  The Judge states that, without\na job, Applicant cannot say when he will have his debts paid off, but he does not appear to question\nthat, were Applicant to have stable employment, he would strive to do so.  Therefore, the Judge has\nnot articulated a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions.\nThe Board concludes that the best resolution to this case is to remand it to the Judge for a\nnew decision, one that addresses the issue of Applicant\u2019s response to his debts, in light of ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 52-year-old former senior field engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. Applicant worked for his defense contractor for about six months before he was laid off in March 2009 (R.T., at 52-53). The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant was raised in a military family. His father was a Vietnam war veteran and a sergeant first class who spent 35 years in the U.S. Army before he passed away in 1992 (see ex. A). Applicant is divorced and has a daughter from his marriage (see ex. 1; R.T., at 60-61). Currently, he has joint custody of his daughter (R.T., at 63). Between 1999 and 2004, Applicant was employed in internet-related businesses (see ex. 1). One was a dot-com company that failed in the late 1990s \u201cwhen the bubble burst\u201d and customers stopped paying their bills (R.T., at 48-49).

The\ncase was assigned to me on May 18, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on June 24,\n2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny,\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of five exhibits (exs. 1 through 5); Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nJuly 27, 2009\n\n2\nand five exhibits (exs. A through D).  DOHA received the transcript (R.T.) on July 10,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nIn June 2009, Applicant\u2019s former employer (a sub-contractor) advised DOHA of\nApplicant\u2019s separation in June 2009.  However, a summary provided on a similar form\nby Applicant\u2019s prime contractor employer the same month contains no separation date.\nBased on the information furnished DOHA to date by Applicant\u2019s last identified\nemployer, DOHA jurisdiction vested to convene a hearing to determine Applicant\u2018s\nsecurity eligibility. \nOnce the hearing commenced, Applicant indicated he was \u201ckind of on a leave of\nabsence\u201d from his employer since March 2009 and has a job waiting for him when he\nreturns (R.T., at 74-75, 84-85).  Information supplied DOHA reports that Applicant\u2019s\nemployer is sponsoring his clearance application (R.T., at 85).  Prospects remain good\nfor Applicant\u2019s returning to work with his current employer should he obtain a favorable\ndetermination of his security clearance application.  In accordance with \u00b6 4.4.1 of the\nDirective, I permitted Applicant\u2019s hearing on the merits to proceed.     \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented financial counseling with a debt consolidation firm and\ndental/medical bills. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted two days to\nsupplement the record with documented financial counseling with a debt consolidation\nfirm and dental/medical bills. The Government was afforded two days to respond.\nWithin the time permitted, Applicant provided copies of (a) a consumer credit\ncounseling action plan with an attached budget and creditor list, (b) an e-mail exchange\nbetween Applicant and creditor 1.f, and (c) an e-mail exchange between Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel.  Department counsel did not object to the admission of the\nsubmissions.  The submissions were admitted as exhibits B and C.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated six delinquent\ndebts, (b) had a judgment entered against him in June 2001 for $7,948.00, (c) had an\nIRS tax lien entered against him in January 2001 (since released) for $25,441.00, and\n(d) had a state tax lien entered against him in September 1999 (since released) for\n$6,701.00. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the debts but denied\nothers.  He claimed most of the debts have since been paid in full (creditors 1.a, 1.d,\n1.e, 1.g, 1.h and 1.i.  He claimed that he is waiting for agreement on repayment plans\nthat cover creditors 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f. \n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old former senior field engineer for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  Applicant worked for his defense contractor for about\nsix months before he was laid off in March 2009 (R.T., at 52-53). The allegations\ncovered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted\nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant was raised in a military family.  His father was a Vietnam war veteran\nand a sergeant first class who spent 35 years in the U.S. Army before he passed away\nin 1992 (see ex. A).  Applicant is divorced and has a daughter from his marriage (see\nex. 1; R.T., at 60-61).   Currently, he has joint custody of his daughter (R.T., at 63).  \nBetween 1999 and 2004, Applicant was employed in internet-related businesses\n(see ex. 1).  One was a dot-com company that failed in the late 1990s \u201cwhen the bubble\nburst\u201d and customers stopped paying their bills (R.T., at 48-49).  This business collapse\ncaused \u201ca lot of financial burdens that I had in 1999 to 2001\" (R.T., at 21, 56, 71).  After\nspending several months (between November 2004 and March 2005) with a\ncommunications firm as a communications engineering manager (see ex. 1), he formed\nand operated his own high-tech company for a number of years (2005-2007) that\ncontracted with foreign governments to install wireless communications (R.T., at 58-60).\nWhile his company prospered, he was current with all of his business and personal\ncreditors.  Once his business faltered in 2007, he could not keep up with his creditors,\nand became delinquent with many of his accounts (R.T., at 49-50). \nApplicant joined a major defense contractor in September 2007 in an engineering\ncapacity and worked for this company for several months (see ex. 1: R.T., at 53) as a\nsenior engineer before his layoff.  Since November 2007 he has held a variety of jobs.\nHe drove a taxicab to support himself and his three-year old daughter who has had\nmajor medical issues to contend with (see ex. A; R.T., at 49-50).  He has seen his\nincome drop about 90 per cent during this difficult period, and has struggled to keep up\nwith his creditors.\nBetween 1993 and 2001, Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts\nduring periods of unemployment and underemployment. Two of the largest debts\ninvolve federal and state tax liens.  Records show that a federal tax lien was entered\nagainst Applicant in January 2001 for $25,441.00, which covered tax years 1993\nthrough 1997.  A state tax lien was entered against Applicant in September 1999 for\n$6,701.00.  Both of these liens have since been released (ex. A).  Applicant\u2019s other\nlarge debt is a judgment entered against him by creditor 1.f in June 2001 for $7,948.00\nto cover back rent owed to a landlord for a leased apartment unit. This judgment\nremains outstanding. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts (six in number) are consumer-related, small for the\nmost part, and exceed $3,000.00 in the aggregate.  Applicant documents payment of\nthree of these consumer debts (creditors 1.a, 1.d and 1.e).  He engaged a debt\n\n4\ncounseling service in June 2009 to explore an action plan for repaying his three\nremaining debts: 1.b (for $1,775.00), 1.c (for $8,019.00), and 1.f (the judgment creditor).\nAll but one of these covered creditors have been located.  Currently, he has enlisted the\nassistance of his debt plan counselors to locate creditor 1.f and convince him to\nparticipate in Applicant\u2019s repayment plan (see exs. C and D; R.T., at 49-50).  To date,\nApplicant\u2019s attempts to contact this landlord creditor to explore payment plan\nalternatives have not been successful (see ex. D; R.T., at 77).  So far this year, he is\nable to document one payment to each of the two creditors identified as agreeable\nparticipants in his plan (see ex. A; R.T., at 36-37), on the strength of his very limited\nincome.  Applicant continues to wait for positive feed-back from creditor 1.f.\nThe financial consumer credit counseling service (CCCS) that met with Applicant\nin June 2009 reviewed his work history, his current layoff status, his limited monetary\nbenefits from his unemployment insurance, and the size of his three major debts he has\nlisted in his proposed action plan. Upon completing its evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\nresources, the firm devised a repayment plan that permitted monthly repayments to\neach of the three listed creditors (i.e., creditors 1.b, 1.c and 1.f) in the amount of $75.00\neach (ex. B).  His financial counselors advised that he would be able to increase his\nmonthly payments once he returned to work. (ex. B).\nApplicant attributes most of his recent debt problems to periods of unemployment\nand underemployment he intermittently experienced following the internet crash in 2001\n(R.T., at 71). Ensuing medical complications with his daughter required surgical\nintervention in September 2005 to repair an intestinal blockage. Child custody\nobligations and other family-related expenses placed additional strains on his limited\nresources during periods when he struggled with low-paying jobs and work-furloughs\n(R.T., at 60-61, 68-72). \nOnce on a promising course of financial recovery with a thriving internet business\nhe owned and managed, Applicant\u2019s available resources quickly dissipated after his\nbusiness failed in 2007. He found full time employment as an engineer with a defense\ncontractor in September 2007, and worked for this contractor for a couple of months\n(ex. 1).  Unable to retain this job, he settled for driving taxi cabs (R.T., at 53-55). \nSince Applicant\u2019s layoff from his current employer, he has relied solely on his\nunemployment insurance to take care of his daughter and his other financial needs\n(R.T., at 54).  Applicant currently receives about $1,500.00 a month in unemployment\nbenefits (see ex. 2; R.T., at 62).  He estimates his current monthly expenses to exceed\nhis current income.  Child support (roughly 25 per cent of his monthly income) and\nincreased rent account for most of his monthly expenses (R.T., at 63).  His child support\nis deducted from the monthly unemployment checks he receives (R.T., at 86-87).\nApplicant has no savings and several aging vehicles that have little market value\n(R.T., at 64-66, 69).  With only his unemployment benefits to cover his bills, he currently\nlimits all of his payments to the \u201cbare minimum\u201d (R.T., at 86). To repay some creditors,\nhe is forced to prioritize his creditor payments.  In prioritizing his debts, he pays certain\n\n5\ncreditors and makes other creditors wait until he has more money to pay them as well\n(R.T., at 69).  Typically, he pays certain bills one month, and other bills the following\nmonth (R.T., at 68-69).  Once he is able to return to work full time, though, he estimates\nthat he will be able to repay his listed debts in a reasonably short period of time (R.T., at\n69).  At the moment, Applicant\u2019s unsatisfied listed debts approximate around\n$17,000.00 (see ex. 2; R.T., at 88-91. Since he does not have any credit cards, he uses\nonly  debit cards to pay his bills (R.T., at 83-84).  \nCurrently, Applicant is working with a debt counseling firm to work out payment\nplans with his three remaining creditors (R.T., at 89-96). The financial consumer credit\ncounseling service that met with him in June 2009 reviewed his work history, his current\nlayoff status and limited income from his unemployment benefits and the size of the\nthree major debts he has listed in his action plan.  Upon completing its evaluation of\nApplicant\u2019s resources it devised a repayment plan that permitted monthly repayments to\neach of the three listed creditors (i.e., creditors 1.b, 1.c and 1.f) in the amount of $75.00\neach (see ex. B).  His financial counselors advised that he would be able to increase his\nmonthly payments once he returned to work. (ex. B).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommon sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\n\n6\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG), \u00b6\n18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because E.O. 10865 requires that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant (currently on a leave of absence from his defense employer),\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during periods of unemployment and\nunderemployment.  While he is able to document payment of his federal and state tax\ndebts and several small debts, he has not heretofore been able to make any headway\nwith his three remaining large creditors.  He is currently working with a credit counseling\nand debt consolidation firm, which has proposed a modest repayment plan pending his\nreturn to work. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and mixed success in resolving them all to\ndate are security-significant. \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\n\n7\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay or otherwise resolve many of them warrant\nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable to recurrent periods of unemployment and under\nemployment between 2001 and 2009.  Faced with so many pressing medical issues at\nhome with his daughter and challenges in finding sustainable work during down periods\nin the high tech industry, Applicant changed career paths and re-directed his engineering\nskills and experience to defense contractors who required security clearances.  For the\nensuing three years (2007-2009), he concentrated his energies and skills on defense-\nrelated employers.  When laid off by the first defense employer, he turned to driving taxi\ncabs to earn enough to take care of his himself and his family (including his ill daughter).\nSince his most recent layoff, he has had no other work and has had to rely exclusively\non his unemployment insurance to meet his financial needs. \nApplicant\u2019s progress to date in regaining control of his finances is promising, but\nstill represents a considerable work in progress that is far from resolution with his\navailable resources. He still is working on resolving his remaining three debts (exceeding\n$17,000.00 in the aggregate), and can provide no estimates as to when he will be able to\npay off these remaining debts without a full time job.  His unemployment benefits are\nquite modest and will expire altogether within the year.  Based on his evidentiary\nshowing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish  some extenuating circumstances\nassociated with his debt accumulations.  As a result, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial\nconsiderations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibility,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019 s circumstances.  \nFull mitigation credit is not available to Applicant, however, based on the facts of\nthis case. Neither Applicant\u2019s oral or written evidence reflect any sustained voluntary\nrepayment efforts on his behalf on his major debts.  His documented payments and\npayment agreements with individual creditors and a debt consolidation firm are\nencouraging, but not enough at this time to warrant full application of any of the\nmitigating conditions covered in the financial guideline.\nApplicant\u2019s financial counseling with his CCCS counselors and active steps he\nhas taken to develop a payment plan with the counseling service entitles him to partial\napplication of MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol.\u201d  However, he has not provided enough probative evidence of his taking control\nof his finances at this time to warrant full application of this mitigating condition.\n\n8\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nBy a whole person assessment of Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness, Applicant\u2019s financial issues may be evaluated in a broader context than\nthe individual disqualifying and mitigating conditions permit.  To be sure, many of his\ndebts are attributable to unforeseen economic conditions that affected both his\nbusinesses and  their industry as a whole.  His cited business achievements and family\ncommitments reflect positively on his career choices and professional growth. And,\ncertainly he has taken some steps to resolve his debts and provide needed medical\nbenefits for his young daughter, even during adverse conditions.  All of this works to\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\nStill, Applicant has not shown enough tangible effort in addressing his remaining\ndebts (including a still outstanding judgment with creditor 1.f) to mitigate his delinquent\ndebts enough to be able to credit him with restored control over his finances.  In balance,\nthe whole person assessment does not enable Applicant at this time to establish\njudgment and trust levels sufficient to enable him to overcome appraised security\nconcerns arising out his accumulation of delinquent debts. \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them with,\nthe limited steps he has mounted in the past to address his old debts, it is still too soon\nto make safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and\nrestore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1b, 1.c and 1.f. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d and 1.e, and 1.g through 1.i. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras.    1b, 1.c and 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n                            \n\n9\nSub-paras.\n1.a, 1.d, 1..e, and \n:\n1.g through 1.i:\nFor Applicant\n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny,\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of five exhibits (exs. 1 through 5); Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n2\nand four exhibits (exs. A through D).  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 10,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information was  denied. \nOn October 29, 2009, the Appeal Board remanded the case for reconsideration\nof the Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances since he lost his job in 2007, and whether he\ncould have made more substantial efforts to repay his remaining three creditors with the\nlimited resources available to him.\nWith the concurrence of both parties, a new hearing was scheduled for\nDecember 11, 2009. A remand hearing was convened as scheduled. At hearing, the\nGovernment relied on no witnesses and added one additional document to the record.\nApplicant testified on his behalf and added four additional exhibits (exs. E through H);.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr). on December 22, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\nremand decision, case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.  \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the remand hearing, Applicant asked for leave to supplement\nthe record with an updated status report of his efforts to resolve his creditor 1.f\njudgment. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted to January 5, 2010 to\nsupplement the record. Applicant subsequently asked for an extension to January 15,\n2010 to supplement the record; his request was granted.  He asked for a third final\nextension to January 22, 2010.  This request was also granted.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documentation of his resolving two of\nhis remaining outstanding debts, his continuing efforts to vacate creditor 1.f\u2019s judgment,\nand more recently, his election to pay off the creditor 1.f judgment in monthly\nincrements.  Applicant\u2019s submissions were accepted as exhibits I through K.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated six delinquent\ndebts, (b) had a judgment entered against him in June 2001 for $7,948, (c) had an IRS\ntax lien entered against him in January 2001 (since released) for $25,441, and (d) had a\nstate tax lien entered against him in September 1999 (since released) for $6,701. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the debts but denied\nothers.  He claimed most of the debts have since been paid in full (creditors 1.a, 1.d,\n1.e, 1.g, 1.h and 1.i.  He claimed that he is waiting for agreement on repayment plans\nthat cover creditors 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old former senior field engineer for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  Applicant worked for the defense contractor for about\n\n3\nsix months before he was laid off in March 2009 (R.T., at 52-53). The allegations\ncovered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted\nas relevant and material findings.   Additional findings follow.\nSettled facts\nApplicant was raised in a military family.  His father was a Vietnam war veteran\nand a sergeant first class who spent 35 years in the U.S. Army before he passed away\nin 1992 (see ex. A).  Applicant is divorced and has a daughter from his marriage (see\nex. 1; 1 Tr. 60-61).  Currently, he has joint custody of his daughter (1 Tr. 63).  \nBetween 1999 and 2004, Applicant was employed in internet-related businesses\n(see ex. 1).  One was a dot-com company that failed in the late 1990s \u201cwhen the bubble\nburst\u201d and customers stopped paying their bills (I Tr. 48-49).  This business collapse\ncaused \u201ca lot of financial burdens that I had in 1999 to 2001\" (1 Tr. 21, 56, 71).  \nAfter spending several months (between November 2004 and March 2005) with\na communications firm as a communications engineering manager (see ex. 1),\nApplicant formed and operated his own high-tech company for a number of years\n(2005-2007) \nthat \ncontracted \nwith \nforeign \ngovernments \nto \ninstall \nwireless\ncommunications (ITr. 58-60).  While his company prospered, he was current with all of\nhis business and personal creditors.  Once his business faltered in early 2007, he could\nnot keep up with his creditors, and became delinquent with many of his accounts (I Tr.\n49-50). \nApplicant joined a major defense contractor in September 2007 in an engineering\ncapacity and worked for this company for several months (see ex. 1: I Tr. 53, II Tr. 81)\nas a senior engineer before his layoff for his lack of a security clearance (II Tr. 82).\nSince November 2007, he has held a variety of jobs. He drove a taxicab to support\nhimself and his three-year old daughter who has had major medical issues to contend\nwith (see ex. A; I Tr. 49-50, 56).  He has seen his income drop about 90 percent during\nthis difficult period, and has struggled to keep up with his creditors.\nBetween 1993 and 2001, Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts\nduring periods of unemployment and underemployment. Two of the largest debts\ninvolve federal and state tax liens.  Records show that a federal tax lien was entered\nagainst Applicant in January 2001 for $25,441, which covered tax years 1993 through\n1997.  A state tax lien was entered against Applicant in September 1999 for $6,701.\nBoth of these liens have since been released (ex. A).  Applicant\u2019s other large debt is a\njudgment entered against him by creditor 1.f in June 2001 for $7,948 to cover back rent\nowed to a landlord for a leased apartment unit. This judgment remains outstanding. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts are consumer-related, small for the most part, and\nexceed $3,000.00 in the aggregate.  Applicant documents payment of three of these\nconsumer debts (creditors 1.a, 1.d and 1.e). He engaged a debt counseling service in\nJune 2009 to explore an action plan for repaying his three remaining debts: 1.b (for\n\n4\n$1,775.00), 1.c (for $8,019.00), and 1.f (the judgment creditor).  All but one of these\ncovered creditors (creditor 1.f) were located.  To ascertain the whereabouts of creditor\n1.f, Applicant enlisted the assistance of his debt plan counselors.  Applicant hoped to\nfind creditor 1.f and persuade him to participate in his  repayment plan (see exs. C and\nD; I Tr. 49-50). \nTo date, Applicant\u2019s attempts to contact this landlord creditor to explore payment\nplan alternatives have not been successful (see ex. D; I Tr.  77).  So far this year, he is\nable to document one payment to each of the two creditors identified as agreeable\nparticipants in his plan (see ex. A; I Tr. 36-37), on the strength of his very limited\nincome.  Applicant continues to wait for positive feed-back from creditor 1.f.\nThe financial consumer credit counseling service (CCCS) that met with Applicant\nin June 2009 reviewed his work history, his current layoff status, his limited monetary\nbenefits from his unemployment insurance, and the size of his three major debts he has\nlisted in his proposed action plan. Upon completing its evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\nresources, the firm devised a repayment plan that permitted monthly repayments to\neach of the three listed creditors (i.e., creditors 1.b, 1.c and 1.f) in the amount of $75.00\neach (ex. B).  His financial counselors advised that he would be able to increase his\nmonthly payments once he returned to work. (ex. B).\nApplicant attributes most of his recent debt problems to periods of unemployment\nand underemployment he intermittently experienced following the internet crash in 2001\n(I Tr. 71). Ensuing medical complications with his daughter required surgical\nintervention in September 2005 to repair an intestinal blockage. Child custody\nobligations and other family-related expenses placed additional strains on his limited\nresources during periods when he struggled with low-paying jobs and work furloughs (I\nTr.  60-61, 68-72). \nOnce on a promising course of financial recovery with a thriving internet business\nhe owned and managed, Applicant\u2019s available resources quickly dissipated after his\nbusiness failed in 2007. He found full time employment as an engineer with a defense\ncontractor in September 2007, and worked for this contractor for a couple of months\n(ex. 1).  Unable to retain this job, he settled for driving taxi cabs (1 Tr. 53-55). \nSince Applicant\u2019s layoff from his current employer, he has relied solely on his\nunemployment insurance to take care of his daughter and his other financial needs (I Tr.\n54).  Applicant currently receives about $1,500.00 a month in unemployment benefits\n(see ex. 2; I Tr. 62).  He estimates his current monthly expenses to exceed his current\nincome.  Child support (roughly 25 percent of his monthly income) and increased rent\naccount for most of his monthly expenses (I Tr.  63).  His child support is deducted from\nthe monthly unemployment checks he receives (I Tr. 86-87).\nApplicant has no savings and several aging vehicles that have little market value\n(1 Tr. 64-66, 69).  With only his unemployment benefits to cover his bills, he currently\nlimits all of his payments to the \u201cbare minimum\u201d (I Tr.  86). To repay some creditors, he\n\n5\nis forced to prioritize his creditor payments.  In prioritizing his debts, he pays certain\ncreditors and makes other creditors wait until he has more money to pay them as well (I\nTr. 69).  Typically, he pays certain bills one month, and other bills the following month (I\nTr.  68-69). \n At his first hearing, he indicated that once he is able to return to work full time,\nthough, he estimates that he will be able to repay his listed debts in a reasonably short\nperiod of time (I Tr. 69). As of the completion of the first hearing, Applicant\u2019s unsatisfied\nlisted debts approximated around $17,000.00 (see ex. 2; I Tr. 88-91). Since he does not\nhave any credit cards, he uses only debit cards to pay his bills (1ITr. 83-84).  \nAt the present time, Applicant is still limited financially to his unemployment\nbenefits (due to be exhausted in about 17 weeks), and is doing all that he can to satisfy\nhis three remaining debts with the income sources he has at his disposal (see exs. E\nthrough H and K; 11 Tr. 72).\nPost-remand findings \nSince issuance of the initial decision, Applicant ceased working with his debt\nconsolidation firm, and has relied on his own efforts to address his remaining three\ndebts (II Tr. 52-53).  He has instituted monthly payments on these three remaining\nunresolved debts (creditors 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f).  His one documented $75 payment to\ncreditor 1.b (see ex. I) still leaves him with a balance in excess of $1,250 (see ex. E; II\nTr. 24, 28-29).  His two documented payments to creditor 1.c leave him with an unpaid\nbalance exceeding $7,500 (see ex. J).  His actions do reflect material progress on these\ntwo debts with the limited income he has from his unemployment benefits (see exs. E\nthrough K).\nAfter a number of unsuccessful efforts to contact his judgment creditor 1.f to\narrange a payment schedule, Applicant filed motions to dismiss and vacate the\njudgment with the Superior Court with cognizant jurisdiction over the case (see exs. E\nand K).  He based his motions on the creditor\u2019s reported failure to communicate with\nhim about his repayment proposals to resolve the judgment balance (II Tr. 33-34, 59-\n69).\nBy the time the record had closed, Applicant\u2019s litigation efforts were still pending\nwithout a decision from the court. Applicant, however, has initiated a monthly plan of his\nown to repay the judgment creditor at the rate of $100 a month pending his return to\nwork, and with increased monthly payments after he returns to work (see ex. K).\nWith his anticipated federal tax refund in April 2010 and his acceptance of a job\noffer with a newly identified employer, Applicant is certain he can complete his\nrepayment plan with the creditor within two years (see exs. E and K; tr. 56-58). At the\npresent time, though, he is still limited financially to his unemployment benefits, and is\ndoing all that he can to satisfy his three remaining debts with the income sources he has\nat his disposal (see exs. E through H and K).\n\n6\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommon sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG), \u00b6\n18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\n\n7\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because E.O. 10865 requires that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant (currently on a leave of absence from his defense employer),\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during periods of unemployment and\nunderemployment.  He is able to document payment of his federal and state tax debts\nand several small debts.  And since the issuance of the initial decision in this case,\nApplicant has mounted considerable efforts to address his remaining debts and restore\nhis finances to current status.  \n Applicant has made tangible headway in regaining control of his finances with the\nminimal resources available to him while unemployed.  He has since discharged several\nof his debts and is currently working on his own to repay his remaining creditors.\nApplicant can be credited to date with  mixed success in resolving all of his delinquent\ndebts to date. \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay or otherwise resolve many of them warrant\nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable to recurrent periods of unemployment and\nunderemployment between 2001 and 2009.  Faced with so many pressing medical\nissues at home with his daughter and challenges in finding sustainable work during down\nperiods in the high tech industry, Applicant changed career paths and re-directed his\n\n8\nengineering skills and experience to defense contractors who required security\nclearances. \nFor the ensuing three years (2007-2009), Applicant concentrated his energies and\nskills on defense-related employers.  When laid off by the first defense employer, he\nturned to driving taxi cabs to earn enough to take care of himself and his family\n(including his ill daughter). Since his most recent layoff, he has had no other work and\nhas had to rely exclusively on his unemployment insurance to meet his financial needs. \nApplicant\u2019s progress to date in regaining control of his finances is promising.\nAlthough his efforts have been modest to date and still represent  a considerable work in\nprogress, he persuades that he is doing all that he can with his available resources to\nrepay his listed debts (exceeding $17,000.00 in the aggregate), and now provides\nestimates that he will complete his repayment plans within the next three years\nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s unemployment benefits are quite modest and will expire\naltogether within the year. Based on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are\nsufficient to establish some extenuating circumstances associated with his debt\naccumulations.  As a result, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe\nconditions that have resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibility,\u201d has some\napplication to Applicant\u2019 s circumstances.  \nBefore the Appeal Board\u2019s remand, full mitigation credit was considered to be\navailable to Applicant based on the developed facts in the record. Neither Applicant\u2019s\noral nor written evidence reflected any sustained voluntary repayment efforts on his\nbehalf on his major debts before his hearing. His documented payments with his\nindividual creditors were considered encouraging, but not enough at that time to warrant\nfull application of one of the important mitigating conditions covered in the financial\nguideline.  MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d also has application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nApplicant\u2019s financial counseling with his CCCS counselors and active steps he\nhas taken to develop a payment plan with the counseling service entitled him to partial\napplication of MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol, \u201d has some application.  Although, he had not at that time provided enough\nprobative evidence of his taking full control of his finances to warrant full application of\nthis mitigating condition.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\n\n9\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nIn the remand hearing, Applicant was able to demonstrate more earnest\nrepayment attention to his remaining creditors, and establish modest repayment plans\nwith his three remaining creditors.  By all accounts, he has shown considerable resolve\nand promising prospects to repaying these creditors with the aid of his expected federal\ntax refund and better paying work.    \nUsing a whole person assessment of Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness, Applicant\u2019s financial issues may be evaluated in a broader context than\nthe individual disqualifying and mitigating conditions permit.  Many of his debts are\nattributable to unforeseen economic conditions that affected both his businesses and\ntheir industry as a whole.  His cited business achievements and family commitments\nreflect positively on his career choices and professional growth. And, certainly he has\ntaken some steps to resolve his debts and provide needed medical benefits for his young\ndaughter, even during adverse conditions.  All of this works to Applicant\u2019s favor.\nFurther, Applicant has shown increased tangible commitment and effort in\naddressing his remaining three debts (including a still outstanding judgment with creditor\n1.f).  His mounted efforts are sufficient to mitigate his delinquent debts enough to be able\nto credit him with restored control over his finances.  In balance, the whole person\nassessment enables Applicant at this time to establish judgment and trust levels\nsufficient to enable him to overcome security concerns arising out his accumulation of\ndelinquent debts. \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations developed in the initial and remand hearings, the limited\nresources he has had to address them with, the proactive steps he has mounted to\naddress his old debts, safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his\ndebts and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security\nclearance may be reliably made. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparas.     1.a through 1.i\nFor Applicant\n                       \n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 24, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 27, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had been employed in the communications industry,\nsuffering unemployment when his business failed.  He started up another company, which installed\n\n2\nwireless communication technology.  He was current on his bills until this business faltered in 2007.\nAfter that he became delinquent on many of his bills.\nHe subsequently began working for a defense contractor but was laid off.  He has held a\nvariety of jobs since, including driving a taxicab.  He has experienced a 90 % drop in income.  In\naddition to his employment difficulties, his daughter has \u201cmajor medical issues.\u201d  Decision at 3.  \nAs stated above, Applicant has had several delinquent debts in the recent past.  Two of the\nlargest, for taxes owed the federal government and the state, have been resolved.  He has paid off\nother debts, but he has three outstanding, which total in excess of $17,000.  His principal source of\nincome at the present time is unemployment benefits.  \nApplicant has engaged the services of a credit counseling agency.  This agency has devised\na debt repayment plan.  \u201cHis financial counselors advised that he would be able to increase his\nmonthly payments once he returned to work.\u201d  Id. at 4.  \nApplicant has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  Therefore, they are not at issue\nin this appeal.  \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\n\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FCMC) 20(b), Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201c[T]he conditions that\n1\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances[.]\u201d\n3\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nwere rooted in circumstances outside his control, that he had paid off some of his debts, and that he\nwas making payments on others.  \u201cBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are\nsufficient to establish some extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations.  As\na result, MC \u00b6 20(b) . . . has some application to Applicant\u2019s circumstances.\u201d  Decision at 7.   The\n1\nJudge stated, however, that Applicant has not been able to estimate when he will be able to pay off\nhis remaining debts without a full time job.  Applicant\u2019s \u201cdocumented payments and payment\nagreements with individual creditors and a debt consolidation firm are encouraging but not enough\nat this time to warrant full application of any of the mitigating conditions covered in the financial\nguideline.\u201d  Id.   \nThe Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion under FCMC 20(b) appears to rest on a view that Applicant\nhas not demonstrated responsible behavior with regard to his debts.  While the Judge noted\nApplicant\u2019s repayment efforts and his having secured the services of a credit counseling agency, he\nseems to have concluded that the extent of Applicant\u2019s remaining debts, viewed in light of his\nprecarious employment situation, are such that it will be a long time at best before he has paid them\nall off.  However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor\nto develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously.  All that is required is that\nan applicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment,\naccompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate\nthe plan.  See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \nWhat constitutes the responsible behavior contemplated by FCMC 20(b) depends on the facts\nof a given case.  In the circumstances at issue here, the Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s poor\nfinancial condition originated in job losses and his daughter\u2019s medical problems, both of which were\noutside his control.  In light of the Judge\u2019s findings, Applicant appears to have acted responsibly\ngiven his limited resources in that he has addressed his financial problems by (1) resolving some of\nthe debts, including the two largest, the tax liens, (2) developing a repayment plan for the remaining\ncreditors, and (3) taking reasonable actions to effectuate the plan.  The Judge\u2019s decision noted that\nApplicant\u2019s primary source of income is his unemployment benefits and that he does not have\nsubstantial assets that could be converted to cash for debt repayment at this time.  But the Judge has\nnot explained what he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the circumstances\nthat he has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or why the approach taken by\nApplicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in light of his limited circumstances.  The Judge states that, without\n\n4\na job, Applicant cannot say when he will have his debts paid off, but he does not appear to question\nthat, were Applicant to have stable employment, he would strive to do so.  Therefore, the Judge has\nnot articulated a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions.\nThe Board concludes that the best resolution to this case is to remand it to the Judge for a\nnew decision, one that addresses the issue of Applicant\u2019s response to his debts, in light of ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Although\nApplicant stated these facts in his response to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), he provided only one\npiece of independent evidence to corroborate his assertions.  The evidence he provided is insufficient to prove the point\nhe sought to demonstrate.  (Neither Applicant\u2019s father nor his child is listed on his security clearance application.)\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written record.

Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On March\n12, 2009, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr. denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant asserts that this\nevidence shows that his inability to satisfy his outstanding debts was due to a period of\nunemployment and medical problems.  He also contends that the Judge erred with respect to several\nof his findings of fact.   For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision.\n1\n(1) The Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported\nby substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.

The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\n\n3\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\noutstanding debts and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the\nJudge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to several\nof the SOR allegations, but reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo. The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

They have no children.\nIn November 2007, Applicant completed both an e-QIP and a SF-86. He noted in\nthe \u201cGeneral Comments\u201d area of the SF-86 that he had not checked his credit reports\nprior to completing the form.  In completing the November 3, 2007, e-QIP, Applicant\n1\ndenied having had his wages garnished or having had any property repossessed for\nany reason within the past 7 years. He did not mention the debts noted under SOR\nallegations 1.q and 1.v until later. Department Counsel conceded allegation 2.c, noting\nthere is no record evidence to support falsification.  \n2\nIn completing the November 22, 2007, SF-86, Applicant denied being over 90-\ndays delinquent on any debts in response to question 28b. Similarly, he denied having\never been over 180-days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years in response to\nquestion 28a. Applicant had delinquent debts of this type, several of which he\nacknowledged when he was apprised of their existence. Applicant denies committing a\nfalsity in giving these answers in November 2007.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the debts contained in\nallegations 1.h ($420, toward which he made one $50 payment), 1.q ($6,434), 1.r ($75,\nfor which he provided documentation of full account satisfaction), 1.v ($13,290), and 1.y\n\n The debts upon which the allegations are based come from credit reports dated December 6, 2007, May 30,\n3\n2008, and July 17, 2008. See Items 8 and 9 (Credit Reports), as well as Item 7 (Response to Interrogatories,\ndated Aug. 7, 2008).\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n4\n3\n($5,653).  He noted that the two largest debts, 1.q and 1.v, to which he admits, were\n3\nrelated to his medical disability. He claims they were charged off because the creditors\nwould not work with him while he was unemployed. In sum, Applicant paid $125 toward\nan acknowledged debt of approximately $26,000. \nApplicant denied the remaining 21 debts, which amount to approximately\n$22,100. In most of his denials, Applicant states terse, one or two sentence assertions\nregarding the accounts. For example, he suggests that some of the adverse credit\nentries pertain to his father and not to him. There is no tangible evidence supporting\nany such assertions. The record only reflects less than five attempts to formally dispute\nor make inquiry as to alleged debts. Similarly, there is no evidence of financial\ncounseling.   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n4\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n6\n Id.\n7\n Id.\n8\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n9\n4\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n5\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n6\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n7\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n8\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n9\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F(Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to be the most pertinent to the\nevaluation of the facts in this case. Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative\nguidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the\nconclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nFailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n10\n5\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Conversely, an individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  The Regulation sets out several potential disqualifying conditions. \n10\nApplicant\u2019s responses to the SOR and FORM include scant facts and little to no\nnarrative as to how these debts were acquired or how they became delinquent. Over\nthe years, Applicant acquired over $48,000 in debt. He denies about half of this\ndelinquent debt as being his. As to the half he admits, he only has paid approximately\n$125 \u2013 a $75 balance on one account and $50 toward a larger bill. Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d)\napply. With such conditions raised, it is left to Appellant to overcome the case against\nhim and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant details a three month period of unemployment following his honorable\ndischarge from the service. He also notes that he was married prior to that discharge,\nbut separated not long after his discharge. Applicant failed, however, to document any\nlinks between these incidents and any specific debts or show that he otherwise\nbehaved responsibly as these delinquent debts accrued. Therefore, Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) does not apply.\nThe delinquent debts at issue are numerous. Their origins are, for the most part,\nunknown. The debts, both admitted and denied, remain largely unaddressed. Of the\napproximately $48,000 at issue, one account for $75 was paid, $50 was paid toward a\nlarger balance, and a couple of accounts were disputed. Therefore, neither Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment\u201d) nor FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) applies. Moreover, Applicant failed\nto offer any evidence that he has received financial counseling. Nor is there evidence\nhis financial problems are otherwise resolved or under control. Therefore, FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) does not apply.\nGiven hints of information regarding Applicant\u2019s medical disability and marital\nseparation, there may be sufficient cause to consider the debts at issue mitigated. The\nburden, however, is on the Applicant to produce evidence of such mitigation and\nApplicant has produced scant evidence or narration regarding his disability, his\nseparation, his finances, or his life. Moreover, taking him at his word that only the\n$26,000 in debt to which he admits is properly attributable to him, he still has only paid\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 15.\n11\n FORM at 4.\n12\n6\nabout $125 toward that balance. Further, he has been employed since March 2007 and\nreceived the SOR in December 2008. Applicant demonstrated minimal efforts in the\nintervening periods to address the debts at issue. With financial considerations security\nconcerns left unmitigated, those security concerns remain.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\n Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Refusal to undergo\n11\nor cooperate with required security processing or refusal to complete required forms,\nreleases, or provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions in connection\nwith a personnel security or trustworthiness determination will normally result in an\nunfavorable clearance action or administrative determination of further processing for\nclearance eligibility. Department Counsel concedes the allegation noted at SOR 2.c\nregarding Applicant\u2019s answer on his November 7, 2007, e-QIP.  That leaves\n12\nconsideration of the financial questions posed on the SF-86 application regarding\nallegations 2.a and 2.b. \nAt the end of his SF-86, Applicant disclosed that he had not consulted his credit\nreport. Not having reviewed his credit report and lacking direct knowledge of those\naccounts included, Applicant could not have deliberately concealed its contents.\nMoreover, Applicant denies concealing information or otherwise committing a falsity,\nand there is no evidence of intentional falsity. Lacking evidence of an intent to falsify, no\ndisqualifying condition can be raised.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\n\n AG \u00b6 2(b).\n13\n7\nfactors noted above. The facts of record are limited due to the brevity of Applicant\u2019s\nsubmissions. Applicant is a young man who, fresh out of high school, chose to serve his\ncountry in the U.S. Army. His service was distinguished and honorable. \nIn the current economic climate, debt has become common place. Delinquent\nand unaddressed debt, however, raise security concerns. Here, Applicant denies half\nthe delinquent accounts at issue are his, citing to various possibilities for their entry on\nhis credit reports. Thus far, however, minimal efforts have been exerted to dispute\nthese entries with his creditors or the major credit reporting bureaus, or to otherwise\nseek their removal from his credit report. As for the delinquent debt to which he admits,\npayment has been made toward only $125 of an admitted balance of approximately\n$26,000. There is no tangible evidence that he sought financial counseling to help\naddress his past delinquent debts, manage his present income, or plan for his future.\nThere is no documentary evidence that he has explored or initiated bankruptcy, a\nrepayment plan, or other strategy to address these delinquent debts. Indeed, there is\nno actual evidence of any comprehensive plan to start addressing the accounts raising\nfinancial security concerns so as to mitigate those concerns. \nAlso lacking, however, is evidence that Applicant intentionally tried to conceal or\nfalsify information about his delinquent accounts. Applicant acknowledged in his SF-86\nthat he had not consulted his credit report. The scant facts of record reflect and support\nhis lack of knowledge as to the extent of the debt reflected on his credit report at the\ntime. Moreover, for much the same reason Department Counsel conceded the\nallegation at SOR 1.c, there is insufficient evidence to suggest intentional falsity or\nconcealment as to SOR allegations 1.a and 1.b.\nIn sum, Applicant is a young man whose military career was cut short by medical\ndisability. For vague reasons, he accumulated between $26,000 and $48,000 in\ndelinquent debt. He failed to provide tangible evidence of efforts to address these\ndebts. The delinquencies at issue remain largely outstanding and unaddressed.\nConsequently, for failing to carry his burden, financial security concerns remain\nunmitigated. Therefore, because any doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information must be resolved in favor of the national security,\nclearance is denied.13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.e\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

His \nstatement of reasons (SOR) listed ten delinquent debts totaling $13,451. He paid two \nSOR debts for $179 and $274. He is making monthly $70 payments on one SOR debt \nand plans to start a $25 monthly payment on a $148 debt in April 2009. He has not \nmade adequate efforts to address his delinquent debts. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 8, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nSensitive Positions (SF 86) with a signed (e-QIP), dated January 3, 2007 (Government \nExhibit (GE) 2). On December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, \nas amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nMarch 26, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n                                           \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 2, 2009, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR response and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non February 19, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February 23, 2009. On \nFebruary 25, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 17, \n2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript \n(Tr.) 16-19), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits. There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GEs 1-6 (Tr. 19). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and \nthe hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on March 23, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for the debts listed in \nthe SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old (Tr. 6, 21; GE 1). In 1989, he graduated from high \nschool (Tr. 6). He has not attended college (Tr. 6). He served in the U.S. Marines from \nAugust 1989 to August 1993 (Tr. 22; GE 1). He served overseas in Operation Desert \nShield/Desert Storm (Tr. 22). He earned the National Defense Service Medal, the \nSouthwest Asia Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (GE 4 at 22). \nHis foreign service is three months and 21 days (GE 4 at 22). He received an Honorable \nDischarge from the U.S. Marines (Tr. 22).  \n \nA government contractor and its predecessor on the same contract, have \nemployed Applicant since January 2006 (Tr. 23). He has not been unemployed in the \nlast five years (Tr. 49). Applicant is a field security technician, and his duties are to \ninstall security equipment, such as card readers and motion detectors (Tr. 7).  He does \nnot have any felony or alcohol or drug-related arrests (GE 1). He has held a Top Secret \nsecurity clearance since 1992 (Tr. 6).  \n \nApplicant married in 1990 and divorced in 1998 (GE 1). He married again in 2006 \n(Tr. 33). His six-year-old son and stepdaughter are living in his home (Tr. 33, 52).  His \nspouse works in a daycare center and so he does not need to pay for childcare (Tr. 52).  \n \n \n \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists ten delinquent debts, totaling $13,451. He has never filed \nfor bankruptcy or had a property lien for taxes or debt (GE 1). He admitted responsibility \nfor the ten debts (Tr. 24). His SF 86 disclosed he had a judgment for $2,700 (GE 1). He \nalso had a 1994 Nissan repossessed (GE 1, GE 3). He disclosed on his SF 86 that he \nhad debts currently over 90 days delinquent and debts over 180 days delinquent in the \nlast seven years (GE 1). He listed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($274); \u00b6 1.h ($6,811); a non-\nSOR judgment in October 2006 for $2,843 toward which he had paid $2,744; and a \nnon-SOR judgment in March 2006 for $2,700 (GE 1). He commented that he may have \nother delinquent debts (GE 1). He has not had any liens or garnishments filed against \nhim (Tr. 38, 40). He did not have any problems paying his rent (Tr. 38-39). \n \nTwo of his SOR debts resulted from personal loans, and most of the others were \nfrom credit cards (Tr. 44-46).  One was from a cell phone account and another was from \nan automobile insurance company (Tr. 46).   \n  \nApplicant was unemployed for one month in 2002 and then underemployed in his \nnext job (Tr. 30, 49). He fell behind on his debts (Tr. 30). He has not been unemployed \nduring the last five years (Tr. 49). Applicant had judgments entered against him in 2006 \nand May 2007 (Tr. 34-37). He paid off the 2006 judgment for $2,843 (Tr. 37).  \n \nApplicant said he was unable to afford payments to address his delinquent SOR \ndebts using a debt consolidation program because it would cost about $500 monthly \n(GE 4). He was unable to borrow money to pay his debts (Tr. 43; GE 4). He paid his \ndelinquent child support debt, his telephone bill and a small judgment (GE 4). \n \nApplicant has taken positive action to resolve four SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f and \n1.j). The creditor in SOR debt \u00b6 1.c ($148) agreed to accept $25 monthly beginning April \n3, 2009 (Tr. 25). Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($274) (Ex. 4 at 3, 8, 9). On \nOctober 15, 2008, he settled and paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($179) (Tr. 27; GE 4 at 18). \nThe 2007 judgment was for $1,200, and he began paying $70 monthly on this judgment \nin May 2008 (Tr. 34-35; GE 4 at 3; SOR \u00b6 1.j). He does not have any arrangements to \npay any of the other SOR debts (Tr. 26-30). \n \nApplicant contacted the creditor in SOR debt 1.g ($85) and learned the debt was \ntransferred to a collection agency (Tr. 28). The collection agency contacted Applicant \nand sent him a letter asking for payment (Tr. 29). Applicant has not responded to the \ncollection agency\u2019s letter (Tr. 29). \n  \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) dated April 4, 2001, \nshowing a gross salary of $3,278 (GE 3). His monthly expenses totaled $725, and \nmonthly debt payments of $905 for five debts totaled $32,700 (GE 3). His net remainder \nwas $1,648 (GE 3). \n  \nApplicant\u2019s PFS, dated in September 2008, is still accurate (Tr. 51; GE 4 at 6). \nHis 2008 PFS shows a gross salary of $4,966 for himself and $1,600 for his spouse (GE \n\n \n \n4 \n6). Their combined net salary is $3,630 (GE 4 at 6). Their monthly expenses total \n$3,365, and include a monthly debt payment of $70 for one debt, which he listed as \ntotaling $1,200 (GE 4 at 6; SOR \u00b6 1.j). His net remainder is $195 (GE 4 at 6). He lists a \ncar expense of $1,400, and his next highest expense is $1,215 for rent, and his third \nhighest expense is $727 for child support (Tr. 32; GE 4). Applicant and his spouse are \nmaking payments on two vehicles (Tr. 41, 52-53). He has about $8,000 in a 401K \naccount (Tr. 40). He has not borrowed against his 401K account (Tr. 41).  Applicant and \nhis spouse do not currently have any credit cards (Tr. 47).  Applicant promised to make \na more aggressive effort to pay his debts (Tr. 58). \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n\n \n \n5 \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his SOR \nresponse and at his hearing. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j, he had ten delinquent \ndebts totaling about $13,451. His financial difficulties began in 2002 and continue today. \nThe government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n \n6 \n                                           \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his ten delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives partial \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because his financial problems \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur;\u201d however, there is some residual doubt \nabout whether he is fully committed to resolving his delinquent SOR debts and is \nmaking adequate steps to do so. He realizes the importance of avoiding delinquent debt \nand promise to make a greater effort to keep his debts current. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply because he did not dispute any of the SOR debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged due to \nreduction of income while he was unemployed and subsequently by underemployment, \nand divorce. He lacked the income to pay some of his debts. About two years ago, he \nobtained his current employment and thereafter he paid several of his debts. He \nestablished that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to the debts \nhe paid.2  \n \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n\n \n \n7 \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received some financial counseling or \nadvice in connection with discussions with debt consolidation companies. He paid some \nof his non-SOR delinquent debts and one judgment. Applicant has taken positive action \nto resolve four SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f and 1.j). Applicant telephoned the creditor in \nSOR debt \u00b6 1.c ($148), and the creditor agreed to accept $25 monthly beginning April 3, \n2009. Applicant paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($274) and 1.f ($179). The 2007 judgment \nwas for $1,200, and he began paying $70 monthly on this judgment in May 2008 (Tr. \n34-35; GE 4 at 3; SOR \u00b6 1.j).  He did not have any arrangements to pay any of the other \nSOR debts (Tr. 26-30). These are some positive \u201cindications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d He understands the security implications of delinquent \ndebt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established some \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant showed some good faith3 in the \nresolution of his SOR debts.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His payment of two small delinquent SOR debts \nfor $179 and $274, his plan to start a $25 monthly payment on a debt for $148, and his \n$70 monthly payments to another SOR creditor are simply inadequate to fully mitigate \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n8 \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for volunteering to serve \nin the U.S. Marines, and serving in Southwest Asia during Operation Desert \nShield/Storm. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the \nDepartment of Defense, his employer and that he is an honorable person. There were \nno allegations of security violations. He does not have any felony arrests or any drug or \nalcohol-related arrests or convictions. Applicant is a security agent. He is a high school \ngraduate, but did not attend college. He is not sophisticated in the area of finance. He \nmade mistakes, and debts became delinquent. Expenses from his divorce and from \npaying child support, as well as unemployment and underemployment contributed to his \nfinancial woes. He received some financial counseling and has learned about how to \navoid future delinquent debts. He paid several non-SOR debts including his child \nsupport debt, and is current on his car loans. He is well on his way to establishing a \nmeaningful track record of debt repayment. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. May 21, 2008). He is motivated to have a successful career as an employee of a \nDepartment of Defense Contractor, to pay his delinquent debts and to have his security \nclearance reinstated. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. He began to have \nfinancial difficulties in 2002, when several debts became delinquent. In October 2008, \nhe received DOHA interrogatories and in December 2008, he received the SOR. He \nhad ample opportunity to contact more of his SOR creditors and to make greater \nprogress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He paid one delinquent SOR debt for $179 \nin October 2008, and another SOR debt for $274 prior to October 2008. He began \nmaking monthly $70 payments in May 2008 to address the judgment related to the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,168). He plans to begin making $25 payments on his $148 debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. He made insufficient progress over the last six months to resolve his delinquent \ndebts, even though he had steady employment and ample opportunity to contact his \ncreditors and provide documentation. For example, in the first three months of calendar \nyear 2009, he described monthly payments of only $70 made to address his SOR \ndebts. He was on clear notice from his receipt of DOHA interrogatories and even more \nso after he received the SOR that he needed to show substantial progress in the \nresolution of his delinquent debts; however, he made insufficient effort to accomplish \nthis security responsibility.      \n\n \n \n9 \nAfter Applicant\u2019s delinquent SOR debts are paid or satisfied, and after a \nreasonable period of time without additional delinquent debts, (assuming no other \ndisqualifying conditions surface), Applicant\u2019s clearance should be reinstated. He needs \nsome time after his SOR debts are paid to reestablish his financial responsibility.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set \nforth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of \nthe whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent \nfactors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s \ncase. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified \ninformation at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAgainst APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs  1.c and 1.d: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g to 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant   \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On September 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nH and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 24, 2008. He\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nDecember 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 13, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on February 2, 2009. The government offered\nExhibits (Ex.) 1-2, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf and presented the testimony of three witnesses. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A-C\nFebruary 20, 2009\n\n2\nwhich were admitted into the record. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non February 10, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.d of the SOR. He also admitted the allegation in \u00b6 2.a. He provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1983 and attended some college classes in 1884. He is twice divorced\nand remarried in 2004. He has four children and eight grandchildren. He has worked in\na professional capacity in the project design field for his entire career. He has been with\nhis current employer for 16 years (GE 1).\nApplicant has suffered from bipolar disorder since he was a child. The disorder\ndid not manifest itself until approximately 1998. Applicant was going through a divorce\nat the time. During counseling, it was suggested that he might have bipolar disorder. He\nsought medical guidance and was put on the drug lithium. He cycles between manic\nand depressive phases every month. He is diagnosed as Bipolar II (AE C). He takes\nvarious prescribed medications (Tr. 14).\nApplicant is a highly creative designer working on projects for defense\ncontractors. About five years ago, he was feeling very stressed with the projects at\nwork. He was experiencing side effects from some of the medications. He was highly\nagitated and believed he could not function in a calm manner. He felt anxious and had\npanic attacks. At that time, he spoke to his psychiatrist, and after reading literature in\nthe area, he decided to try smoking marijuana to alleviate some of the great stress that\nhe was experiencing. The marijuana did alleviate the symptoms (Tr. 15).\nOne medication that Applicant uses causes anxiety and the other prescribed\nmedication to alleviate that side effect increases a rapid cycling in his disorder.\nApplicant stressed that using marijuana is not the best solution for his problem but it is a\nsolution for him. It allows him to relax. The prescribed medication (Lorazapam) for high\nanxiety leaves him with adverse side effects (Tr. 33).\nApplicant uses marijuana in his home. After work if he feels anxious and wants to\nrelax, he will smoke marijuana. His wife sometimes uses it as well. His wife provides the\nmarijuana and Applicant does not know her source.  At the hearing, Applicant explained\nhe still uses marijuana. His last use was two days before the hearing. He was candid in\nhis remarks that he will continue to use it. However, he acknowledged that it is not the\nappropriate way to handle the situation. Applicant wants to find a \u201csubstitute legal\nmedication\u201d to help him manage his disorder rather than use marijuana.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s employer described Applicant as a very trustworthy individual. He has\npersonally known Applicant since 2002. He believes Applicant is a good father, husband\nand good person. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s condition and his use of marijuana. He\nsocializes with Applicant and his wife. His employer has never seen any negative effects\nfrom Applicant\u2019s bipolar condition. He stated it would be helpful for the company if\nApplicant received a security clearance (Tr. 41). He recommends Applicant for a\nsecurity clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s project manager testified in Applicant\u2019s behalf. He explained that\nApplicant approached him after he completed his security application and advised him\nthat he was using marijuana for his bipolar condition. His project manager initially had\nconcerns and discussed them with Applicant. The project manager complimented\nApplicant on his technical expertise as well as his effectiveness with clients and other\ndepartment heads in the company. Applicant has a good relationship with customers,\narchitects, design teams, and his colleagues (Tr. 49). He praises him as trustworthy and\nrecommends Applicant for a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s step-son describes him as a good person. His step-son has four\nyoung children and often allows them to spend time with Applicant at the family home.\nHe knows that Applicant uses marijuana but has not seen any use. He also works in the\nsame company with Applicant and has no reservations about him professionally or\npersonally.\nApplicant\u2019s employer has a drug policy for its employees (Tr. 35). The company\nhas random drug testing. Applicant discussed his marijuana use with his direct\nsupervisor. Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to section 24 on his security clearance application\n(illegal drug use) and noted in detail his bipolar condition and his use of marijuana (GE\n1). Applicant also described his marijuana use in his June 2008 interrogatories (Ge 2).\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that his psychiatrist knows of his marijuana\nuse but has not prescribed it for Applicant (Tr. 22). His doctor sees him on a regular\nbasis and monitors his medications (Depakote, Lexapro, and Lamicile). Applicant\u2019s\nphysician does not believe that Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder impairs his judgment or\nwould affect his ability to hold a security clearance (Tr. 30).\nApplicant\u2019s evaluations are excellent. He receives the high ratings in all areas.\nHis leadership and key role in implementation of projects is highlighted. He is\npassionate about his work and has a wide range of talents and abilities. (AE B).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant admitted his use of marijuana every other day from October 2005 through\nJune 2008. \nUnder AG \u00b6 25(g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d\nis a disqualifying condition. Applicant used marijuana after submitting his security\nclearance application in 2007. He also expressed his intent to continue using the illegal\ndrug. Under AG \u00b6 25(h) \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to\nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use\u201d is a disqualifying condition.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nuse of marijuana is ongoing. He was candid at the hearing that he will continue to use it\nto help manage his bipolar condition. I do not find that this mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where there is Aa demonstrated intent not\nto abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase for the reasons discussed above.\nThe Bond Amendment, 50 USC Section 435b, prohibits all Federal agencies from\ngranting or renewing a security clearance for any person who is an unlawful user of a\ncontrolled substance or is an addict. The Department of Defense (DoD) issued interim\nguidance defining an unlawful user of a controlled substance as a \u201cperson who uses a\ncontrolled substance and has lost the power of self-control with reference is the use of\n\n6\nthe controlled substance, and any person who is a current user of the controlled\nsubstance in a manner other than as prescribed by a licensed physician.\u201d Such use in\nnot limited to the use of drugs on a particular day, or within a matter of days or weeks\nbefore, rather that the unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the\nindividual is actively engaged in such conduct. An \u201caddict\u201d of a controlled substance is\ndefined as \u201can individual who habitually uses any narcotic drug so as to endanger the\npublic morals, health, safety, or welfare; or is so far addicted to the use of narcotic drugs\nas to have lost the power of self-control with reference to his addiction. (Memorandum,\nSubject: Interim Guidance for the Implementation of Public Law 110-181, Section 3002\n(the Bond Amendment) Regarding Adjudication of Security Clearances, date June 20,\n2008).\nIn this case, Applicant could be an \u201cunlawful user\u201d. It is not clear if he has lost the\npower of self-control of marijuana since he sees it as a means to resolve his bipolar\nanxiety. He wants a legal means to relieve the anxiety but he did not present\ninformation to carry his burden of proving that he is not an unlawful user. His efforts to\nfind a legal means are not sufficient and could indicate his lack of self-control as to\nmarijuana.\nApplicant is at least an \u201caddict\u201d in that he habitually uses marijuana and his use\ncan endanger public morals, health, safety, or welfare, even though he only uses at\nhome the marijuana supplied by his wife. \nUnder the Bond Amendment, Applicant is an unlawful user or addict and has not\nmet his burden of proof in this case. He did not present sufficient information to mitigate\nthe application of the Amendment and is barred from a security clearance for those\nreasons.\nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase for the reasons discussed above.\n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n7\nUnder the guideline, AG \u00b6 16, describes conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying. Applicant disclosed his use of marijuana on his\nsecurity clearance application. He explained that he used it to reduce anxiety and\neliminate side effects of his prescription drugs on his security questionnaire. He\nanswered his June 2008 interrogatories in detail and explained the frequency of use. He\ndid not fail to provide any truthful answers not attempt to deceive the Government. He\nbelieves his limited use of the illegal drug does is consistent with his respectable and\nstable family lifestyle. He has spoken to his employer concerning the use. He also\nspoke to his psychiatrist about the use of marijuana. However, he does not have a\nprescription for marijuana. He clearly intends to continue the illegal use of marijuana\ndue to his bipolar condition. His behavior and personal conduct are disqualifying as they\nraise questions about his judgment and reliability and a willingness to comply with the\nlaw. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of\nthem apply in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2\u00a9, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that they are not\nsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. He served in a professional capacity for his entire career. He is an\nexemplary employee and has been with his employer for 16 years. He is highly\nrecommended for a security clearance.\nApplicant was candid and forthright at the hearing. He suffers from a bipolar\ndisorder that causes him anxiety. He takes prescribed medication for this disorder.\nHowever, he uses marijuana now to help ease the side effects of his multitude of\nprescribed medications and to calm him. He uses marijuana at home with his wife. He\ndoes not deny or dispute the government\u2019s concern. His continued use of marijuana,\n\n8\nregardless of the motivation for the use, is prohibited by law. In addition, under the Bond\nAmendment, Applicant is precluded from a security clearance if he is a current user. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  \nSpecifically, Applicant contends that the Judge made factual errors.  Applicant also maintains\nthat the Judge did not consider all the record evidence and did not give sufficient weight to\nApplicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent factual findings: In March 2007, after almost three\nyears at a job, Applicant was terminated for improperly obtaining and releasing confidential\ninformation about a coworker.  Applicant was unemployed from March until May 2007.  Applicant\nworked from May until August 2007, but was terminated because her job location changed and\nApplicant did not have adequate transportation to reach the new location.  Applicant was then\nunemployed from August to September 2007, when she obtained her current job.  \nApplicant purchased her home in February 2004.  Applicant\u2019s mother and sister along with\nher sister\u2019s two children live with Applicant.  Applicant\u2019s mother and sister together pay $2,000 per\nmonth rent, and they pay for groceries and utilities.  Applicant\u2019s mortgage went into default in\nSeptember 2007, at the same time that she began her present job.  To avoid foreclosure, Applicant\nentered into a default forbearance agreement with her mortgage company under which she paid a\ntotal of $9,000 on November 1, 2008, and agreed to pay increased mortgage payments.  At the\nhearing, Applicant provided documentation that she had made mortgage payments under the\nagreement in November and December 2008.  Before the close of the record, Applicant provided\ndocumentation for three payments on her delinquent mortgage in March, May, and June 2008. \nBetween 2004 and 2007, Applicant accumulated approximately $80,000 in credit card debt.\nShe used the credit cards to repair and renovate the house.  Applicant stopped paying her credit card\nbills when she was unemployed in 2007.  Applicant failed to pay her credit card delinquencies after\nshe began working again.  Applicant admitted eight delinquent credit cards alleged in the SOR\nranging in size from $2,000 to $27,865.  Applicant sought credit counseling in September 2007, but\ndid not make payments on her credit card debt until she signed an agreement with a debt repayment\nservice in September 2008.  Since the first eight months of payments under the agreement go almost\nentirely for the repayment service\u2019s fee, Applicant has still paid almost nothing toward her credit\ncard debt. \n \n\nIn identifying alleged errors, Applicant makes statements that extend beyond the evidence in the record and\n1\nthus constitute new evidence. The Board cannot consider new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant believes that the Judge should have further developed evidence of mitigation.  In DOHA\n2\nproceedings, Applicant has the responsibility to present all the evidence she wants the Judge to consider and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance decision.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n3\nApplicant also owes more than $1,000 to her state unemployment commission.  The debt\narose in 2007. She verbally agreed to pay $200 per month for five months, beginning in January\n2009, and had made no payments at the time of the hearing.  Applicant\u2019s total take-home pay\n(including the rent payments by relatives) minus the debt payments discussed during the hearing\n(first and second mortgage, debt repayment service, and the payment to the unemployment\ncommission) leaves a remainder of $456.  A Personal Financial Statement dated August 1, 2008,\nwhich also included other monthly expenses, showed a remainder of only $132.37. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant identifies a number of statements in the Judge\u2019s decision that\nshe considers to be in error.  Applicant states that the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that Applicant\ndocumented three mortgage payments in her post-hearing submission, whereas Applicant notes there\nwere five payments.  Applicant is correct; there are  five payments, which appear to be part of at least\ntwo earlier default forbearance agreements.  There is at least some support in the record for other\nstatements Applicant identifies as error.   However, Applicant has not identified any harmful error.\n1\nIn light of Applicant\u2019s financial situation as a whole, it is unlikely that the identified statements, if\nchanged as Applicant suggests, would lead to a different result in Applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-20062 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 15, 2008).  \nApplicant also maintains that the Judge did not consider all the record evidence.  There is a\nrebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, unless the Judge\nspecifically states otherwise.  Furthermore, there is no requirement that the Judge mention or discuss\nevery piece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 16, 2005).  Applicant has not demonstrated error in this regard.  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to the her evidence of\nmitigation.   As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\n2\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2\n(May 23, 2008).\n\n4\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is affirmed.\nSigned; Michael Y.

Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on \nJune 24, 2004. She recertified the SF 86 on January 10, 2005. On November 28, 2007, \nshe completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP). On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 14, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 2, 2008. I convened a hearing on January 7, 2009, to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced seven exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 7 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf and called no witnesses. She introduced two exhibits, which \nwere marked as Ex. A and Ex. B and admitted to the record without objection. \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business on \nJanuary 14, 2009, so that Applicant could, if she wished, provide additional information \nfor the record. Applicant timely filed one additional exhibit. Department Counsel did not \nobject to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission. I marked the post-hearing submission as   \nEx. C, and it was admitted to the record. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on January 26, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains ten allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.j.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nall ten allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and never married. She has attended evening college \nclasses for several years, and she hopes to receive a degree in electrical engineering in \n2009.  She is also pursuing a degree in computer science.  Since September 2007, she \nhas been employed as an operations specialist by a federal contractor. Her annual \nsalary is $58,000. She currently holds a security clearance and seeks a higher level of \nclearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 36-40, 47, 76.) \n \n \nFrom May 2004 to March 2007, Applicant worked for employer A. She was \nterminated by employer A because she had improperly obtained and released \nconfidential information about a coworker. In September 2006, prior to her termination, \nApplicant was counseled by employer A for aggressive behavior toward her coworkers. \nApplicant was unemployed for two months between March and May 2007. From May \n2007 until August 2007, Applicant worked for employer B.  When employer B moved its \noperations to another location in the same general area, Applicant refused to travel to \nthe new location because she claimed she did not have access to adequate \ntransportation. She was terminated by employer B, and she was unemployed from \nAugust to September 2007, when she acquired the position she now holds.  (Tr. 42-48; \n73-75.)    \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant purchased the home in which she and her family had \nbeen living as tenants since 1991. She purchased the house for $350,000. She \nobtained a first mortgage on the property for $297,000. She also obtained a second \nmortgage of $40,000 on the property.  The seller of the property reduced the purchase \nprice of the house by $12,000.  Applicant put $3,000 of her money toward the purchase \nprice of the home and paid closing costs. Applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and the sister\u2019s two \nchildren live with her in the home. Together, the mother and sister pay Applicant $2,000 \na month in rent. The mother and sister also pay all utilities on the home and purchase \nall groceries.  (Tr. 38-40, 63-65, 78.) \n \n \nApplicant used credit cards to finance repairs and renovations to her house. \nBetween 2004 and 2007, she accumulated approximately $80,000 in credit card debt.  \nWhen she lost her job with Employer B, she stopped paying her credit card debt. In \nSeptember 2007, when she began to work for her present employer, Applicant\u2019s \nmortgage went into default, and she failed to pay her credit card delinquencies.  (Tr. 72-\n75.)   \n \n \nApplicant admitted the following delinquent credit card debts: a debt of $9,804 on \nan account that was opened in February, 2004 and which was charged off in January \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.); a debt of approximately $20,0001 on an account that was opened in \n2004 and which had not been paid since June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.); a debt of $2,778 on \nan account opened in 2004 and which had not been paid since June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.); \na debt of $10,248 on an account opened in March 2004 and which had not been paid as \nof September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.); a debt of $27,865 on an account opened in March \n2004 and which had not been paid since February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.); a debt of $11,255 \non an account which had not been paid since October 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f.); a debt of \n$5,641 on an account which had not been paid since August 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.g.); and a \ndebt of approximately $2,000 on a credit card account (SOR \u00b6.1.j.). (Ex. 5; Tr. 48-56, \n88-89.) \n \n \nApplicant sought credit counseling in September 2007. She made no further \npayments on her delinquent credit card debts until she contracted with a debt \nrepayment service in September 2008. According to her agreement with the debt \nrepayment service, Applicant will pay the service $824 a month for 60 months. For the \nfirst eight months, the debt repayment service will charge Applicant a service fee of \n$760 a month, leaving only $63 each month for payment to her creditors.  From months \nnine to 24, the debt repayment service will charge Applicant a service fee of $332, \nleaving $491 each month for payment to her creditors. (Ex. B; Tr. 81-88.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s agreement with the debt repayment service makes clear that the \nservice does not provide funds for settlement offers from creditors, and it cautions \ncustomers that they must save additional money to respond to settlement offers. \nApplicant failed to provide documentation to corroborate payment to the debt repayment \nservice. (Ex. B at 1; Tr. 96-97.) \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s Ex. B identified the amount of this debt as $15,948. (Ex. B.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant also owes a debt of $1,041 to her state employment commission. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.h.) The debt was incurred in 2007, and Applicant has known of the debt since \nSeptember 2007. She has a verbal agreement to pay the debt in five installments of \n$200, beginning in January 2009. As of the date of her hearing, Applicant had made no \npayments.  (Ex. 5; Tr. 56-60.) \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant was notified that her primary home mortgage, an \nadjustable rate mortgage, was in default and would be subject to foreclosure.2 As of \nSeptember 2008, the $293,000 account had not been paid and was placed for \ncollection. (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) To cure the default, Applicant entered into a forebearance \nagreement and payment plan. On November 1, 2008, she remitted two payments \ntotaling $9,000 to the mortgage servicing company. Half of the money came from her \nsavings and half came from her mother and sister. She then committed to 23 increased \nmonthly mortgage payments of $3,354 from November 2008 to September 30, 2010.  At \nher hearing, she provided documentation showing she had made the required payments \nin November and December 2008. In a post-hearing submission, she provided \ndocumentation showing she had also made three payments on her delinquent mortgage \nin March, May, and June 2008. (Ex. A; Ex. C; Tr. 78-81, 92.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take-home pay is $3,249. In addition, she receives $2,000 in \nrent from her family members. The monthly payment on her primary mortgage is \n$3,354. The monthly payment on her second mortgage is $415. Each month she pays \n$824 to the debt repayment service on her credit card debt. She has a verbal payment \nplan to pay her state unemployment commission $200 for five months, beginning in \nJanuary 2009. Her remainder after these payments is $456.3  She reports $600 in \nsavings.  (Tr. 81, 92-95.) \n \n \nSince Applicant purchased her house for $350,000 in 2004, it has increased in \nvalue. It now has an assessed value of $534,000. She intends to refinance her \nmortgage at some time in the future and to use the proceeds to pay her debts. (Tr. 100-\n102.)  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \n \n2 At the time of her hearing, Applicant was current on her second mortgage payments. (Tr. 66.) \n  \n3 Applicant provided a Personal Financial Statement, dated August 1, 2008, showing a net remainder of \n$132.37 after subtractions for monthly fixed expenses and financial obligations. (Ex. C.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n \n \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to \npay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d))  \n \nMost of Applicant=s financial delinquencies arose between 2004 and 2007, after \nshe purchased a home and used credit cards to pay for substantial home repairs. Her \nfinancial stability was affected when her actions caused her to be terminated from two \njobs in 2007. These circumstances have resulted in overwhelming debt which continues \nto the present day, a situation which raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good judgment.   \n \nApplicant sought consumer credit counseling and has recently made good faith \nefforts to pay or settle her financial delinquencies. She provided financial records to \nshow she took action to forestall foreclosure on her home by paying a lump sum of \n$9,000 and committing to an increased first mortgage payment for 23 months. Her \ncurrent plans to pay her two mortgages, her credit card debt, and her debt to her state\u2019s \nemployment commission leave her with very little remainder to save for settlement \noffers under the terms of her debt repayment plan. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 \n20(d) apply in part in mitigation, but that AG \u00b6 20(a) and AG \u00b6 20(b) do not apply in \nmitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nwhen she was a mature adult. Her own actions led to her being terminated from two \npositions in 2007, and her subsequent unemployment made it difficult for her to honor \nher financial commitments. However, she failed to address her delinquent debts for a \nsignificant period of time, a decision that raises concerns about her judgment and \nreliability. \n \nTo her credit, Applicant has taken action in the past several months to address \nher delinquencies. At her hearing, she provided documentation showing good faith \nefforts to revitalize her first mortgage and to pay her credit card debt. However, these \nactions are recent and do not demonstrate a track record of satisfaction of debt \nconsistently over time.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation arises from unusual circumstances, and she may \nfind it beneficial to seek additional professional financial counseling and legal advice \nabout resolving her debts and acquiring financial stability in the near term.  Applicant \ncan reapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this decision becomes \nfinal.  If she wishes, she can produce new evidence that addresses the Government\u2019s \ncurrent security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.: Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On December 15, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 29, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge considered all the record\nevidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent mitigating conditions was erroneous; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found against Applicant on four of the seven debts alleged in the SOR.  These four\nwere delinquent debts arising from credit cards, consumer purchases, a car loan, and a veterinarian\nbill.  The total amount of this debt is $22,260.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused in part\nby a job loss.  To address his financial situation, Applicant entered into a relationship with a debt\nconsolidation company.  Applicant submitted to the Judge five checks that he claimed he had sent\nto this company in payment for its services.  However, he subsequently stated that he had informed\nthe company to shred the checks and that they had not actually been cashed.  In deciding the case\nadversely to Applicant, the Judge stated that Applicant \u201cshould have acted more aggressively to pay\nhis delinquent debts[.]\u201d  Decision at 10.  \n In support of his appeal Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the record,\nfor example three credit reports dated September 8, 2009.  The Board cannot consider this new\nevidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal\nBoard\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  Applicant contends that\nthe Judge did not consider evidence which he believes to be favorable to his case.  For example, he\ncontends that the Judge did not read his contract with the debt consolidation company.  However,\na Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.

May 23, 2008).\nApplicant\u2019s appeal presentation is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.\nApplicant points to favorable language in the Judge\u2019s decision which, inter alia,\nacknowledges that Applicant has paid off certain debts not listed in the SOR, that he has never had\na security violation, that he is a law-abiding citizen and good family member, and that his financial\nproblems were \u201cinitially caused by unemployment and underemployment[.]\u201d Decision at 10.\nApplicant believes that these comments by the Judge are inconsistent with his unfavorable decision.\nHowever, the Judge went on to say that these favorable matters are outweighed by evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s lack of judgement in the management of his financial affairs and other evidence which\nthe Judge reasonably concluded detracted significantly from Applicant\u2019s credibility.  Read in context,\nthe comments which Applicant has cited merely demonstrate that the Judge considered the full range\nof potentially mitigating evidence contained in the file but concluded that such evidence was not\nsufficient to establish that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion.  \n\n3\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 6, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On December 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 13, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 10). Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on April 14, 2009. On April 16, 2009, DOHA assigned \nthe case to me. On April 17, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was \nheld on May 20, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE \n1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 16-17), and Applicant offered one exhibit (Tr. 53-54; AE A). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 17) and AE A (Tr. 54). Additionally, I \nadmitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 8-10). Applicant \nsubmitted one document, which I admitted without objection on May 28, 2009 (AE B). I \nreceived the transcript on May 28, 2009. Applicant submitted a bank statement, which I \nadmitted on June 29, 2009 (AE C). On July 9, 2009, I sent an email through Department \nCounsel to Applicant requesting information about the five checks he submitted as part \nof his SOR response (AE D). On July 9 and 13, 2009, Applicant sent his responses (AE \nE and F). Department Counsel did not object to my consideration of any post-trial \nexhibits, and I admitted them (AE E and F). I closed the record on July 15, 2009.      \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.d with explanations (GE 10). He denied responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e to 1.g (because they were paid)(GE 10). He provided a $65 payment receipt \nresolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f (GE 10 at 19).

Shortly after graduation from high school, he \njoined the Army and served on active duty in the Army for eight months (Tr. 18). He has \nan associate\u2019s degree in electronic engineering and is close to completion of his \nbachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 7). He currently holds an interim secret clearance, which is \nrequired for his employment (Tr. 8, 20). He married his wife in 1996 (Tr. 19). She has \nbeen employed for the last 12 years as a teacher (Tr. 55). He has a 22-year-old son, \nand two children, ages eight and six with his spouse (Tr. 19). A defense contractor has \nemployed him as a network administrator since February 2008 with an annual salary of \n$51,500 (Tr. 19). \n \nApplicant\u2019s initial financial problems resulted from unemployment and \nunderemployment.

He purchased most of the items \nassociated with his delinquent debts in the 2000 to 2001 timeframe (Tr. 30-31). He \nworked at various low-paying jobs from February 2001 to February 2008 to earn income \nand support his family, such as selling insurance, waiting tables, repairing computers, \nand constructing fences and patios (Tr. 31-37, 56-58). The following table shows his \nincome for 1998 to 2007 (AE A). \n \nYear \nAmount \nYear \nAmount \n1998 \n$29,729 \n2003 \n$19,060 \n1999 \n$37,492 \n2004 \n$21,351 \n2000 \n$46,917 \n2005 \n$11,847 \n2001 \n$57,985 \n2006 \n$21,578 \n2002 \n$13,441 \n2007 \n$33,428 \n \nDebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d  \n \nApplicant said in his SOR response that the four debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($2,070), 1.b \n($3,791), 1.c ($4,167), and 1.d ($12,232), totaling $22,260, were \u201cpart of the [his debt \nconsolidation company\u2019s (DCC)] settlement package\u201d (GE 10 at 3). These four debts \nconstitute 98 percent of his total SOR debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($2,070) is an animal hospital bill (Tr. 20). In 2004, Applicant picked \nup a dog that a car hit and took it to the hospital (Tr. 21-23). He kept the dog (Tr. 21).2 \nAt first he disputed the debt because he was not the owner at the time the dog was \ninjured (Tr. 21-23). Eventually he decided to pay it and added it to his DCC payment \nprogram (Tr. 21).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($3,791) is a credit card debt (Tr. 23). He stopped making payments \nin 2002 (Tr. 23).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($4,167) is a debt to a department store for electronic purchases in \n1999 to 2002 (Tr. 24). His last payments were in 2002 or 2003 (Tr. 24).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($12,232) is a debt owed for a vehicle loan (Tr. 25). His vehicle was \nvoluntarily repossessed (Tr. 26). He stopped making payments at the end of 2001 (Tr. \n26-27). \n \nDebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e to 1.g  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($25), 1.f ($65) and 1.g ($209) are medical debts (Tr. 25, 27-30; GE \n9, 10). He said he previously paid these three debts (Tr. 25, 28). He provided \ndocumentation to show he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e in July 2008 (Tr. 28; GE 10 at \n19). The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g are not on his credit report (Tr. 25, 29-30).   \n \n                                            \n2 He said on his SF-86, \u201cI don\u2019t even have the dog. I guess the[y] fixed him up and adopted him \nout and left me with the bill. This debt is in dispute\u201d (GE 1 at Section 28). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement \n \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s combined current net monthly income is $5,759 (Tr. 44; \nGE 2 at 46). Their monthly expenses are as follows: first and second mortgage ($980); \nfood ($400); clothing ($100); car expenses ($350); child support ($500); daycare ($260); \nand about $1,000 in miscellaneous expenses (Tr. 44-51). Most of Applicant\u2019s child \nsupport payments were used to address interest on his child support arrearage (Tr. 48-\n50). He did not pay child support for the first 10 years of his son\u2019s life and the arrearage \nis substantial (Tr. 48-50). Applicant and his wife have about $900 left at the end of the \nmonth to address their debts (Tr. 51). They have about $800 total in savings and \nchecking accounts (Tr. 52). They have not taken out any new credit cards in the last five \nyears (Tr. 53).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with DCC  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statements about making payments to DCC from October 2008 \nthrough February 2009 as part of his SOR response raised credibility concerns. On \nAugust 11, 2008, Applicant first disclosed his reliance on DCC to address his four large \ndelinquent debts (Tr. 51; GE 2 at 5). He also provided his contract with DCC (dated \nAugust 13, 2009), an automatic bank withdrawal authorization form, and his August \n2008 checking account, which showed a payment to DCC on August 4, 2008 (GE 2 at \n6-13 and 15).  \n \nOn October 20, 2008, DOHA received a response to interrogatories (GE 3). \nDOHA asked for information about payments DCC made to creditors. Applicant \nprovided an unrelated bank statement from August 2008; however, he did not provide \nany information about DCC\u2019s payments to creditors (GE 3). \n \nAs part of his SOR response on February 13, 2009, Applicant provided another \ncopy of the DCC agreement (GE 10 at 5-9). He also provided a bank statement, \nshowing $334 payments on August 4, 2008 and September 3, 2008 (GE 10 at 11 and \n13). He provided photocopies of five checks allegedly written to DCC with a notation \nindicating for \u201cDebt Settlement,\u201d on them as indicated in the following table. \n \nCheck Date \nCheck Number \nCheck Amount \nCitation \nOct. 1, 2008 \n1029 \n$343.63 \nGE 10 at 16 \nNov. 1, 2008 \n1040 \n$343.63 \nGE 10 at 17 \nDec. 1, 2008 \n1052 \n$343.63 \nGE 10 at 18 \nJan. 2, 2009 \n1060 \n$343.63 \nGE 10 at 19 \nFeb. 1, 2009 \n1073 \n$343.63 \nGE 10 at 20 \nTOTAL \n5 Checks \n$1,718.15 \nGE 10 at 16-20 \n   \nDepartment Counsel asked Applicant to show these five checks were sent or \ncashed, or the payments were actually made (Tr. 39). Applicant responded: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nI don\u2019t have it with me, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to get it, because it \nwent so far back. And just so the Court knows, the last couple of months, \nwhich the Court [does not] have any documents, I have an unauthorized \ndraft of my account, and we did not know what it was, and I had my \naccount with [a company], everything closed out. \n \nSo any drafts that [were] made to my account, they stopped and [DCC] \nwas one of them. And then after I got everything reinstated, I had to get \nwith [DCC], and they started up again. And the Court does not have any \ndocuments on that, but I \u2013 you know, I want to let the Court know that \neverything\u2019s in order with that. . . . [He did not recognize the amount of an \nautomatic withdrawal from his account, subsequently determined to be \nrelated to a mortgage account and the bank] suggested I freeze all drafts \non my account until we could \u2013 they could figure out who it was.  \n \n(Tr. 39-40). Applicant said his payments stopped in February or March and restarted in \nMay 2009 (Tr. 40). He said he was considering terminating the relationship with DCC, \nand seeking a different debt consolidation or resolution service (Tr. 41). He thought \nDCC\u2019s charges were excessive (Tr. 41, 61). I advised Applicant that the key to his case \nwas proving he made the payments to DCC (Tr. 60, 62). Applicant received a 10-day \npost-hearing delay to seek a statement from DCC showing how much he paid into his \naccount (Tr. 59).      \n \nOn May 28, 2009, Applicant provided an unsigned letter from DCC indicating \nApplicant is a client of DCC \u201cin good standing since July 7th, 2008;\u201d however, privacy \nlaws prevent DCC from disclosing further information about DCC\u2019s representation of \nApplicant (AE B at 3).  \n \nOn June 11, 2009, I responded to Applicant that unless he provided a statement \nfrom DCC showing how much he paid DCC, \u201chis failure is likely to result in an adverse \nsecurity clearance determination.\u201d (AE C at 2). On June 29, 2009, I received a bank \nstatement from Applicant indicating he paid DCC $312.22 on June 16, 2009 (AE C at 5).  \n \nOn July 9, 2009, I sent the above five checks to Applicant and asked him to \nprovide an account statement from DCC showing the amounts DCC received from him, \nmonthly bank statements showing his payments to DCC, or the cancelled checks listed \nin the above table (AE D at 1). I suggested that his failure to provide this information \nmay be construed as an attempt to mislead the government by providing five checks to \nthe government even though he knew those checks were never cashed by DCC (AE D \nat 1).  \n \nOn July 9, 2009, Applicant admitted that his payments to DCC \u201cwere ceased for \na bit;\u201d however, he emphasized that his account remained in good standing (AE F at 2).  \n \nOn July 13, 2009, Applicant said he wrote DCC post-dated checks (AE E at 2). A \nweek or two after he sent the post-dated checks, he told DCC not to cash them and he \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nasked them to shred the checks (AE E at 2). He explained how the checks were \nincluded in his SOR response (AE E at 2): \n \nI realize how this looks with those five checks submitted to the \ngovernment as part of my paperwork. I really don\u2019t understand how those \nwere sent in as part of my defense. It was never my intention [nor] is it \nnow to ever deceive the government in anyway.       \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7.

Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that \nare of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his \nSOR response and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors \nwere paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Four substantial SOR debts are currently \ndelinquent. He does not have a credible plan to address these four SOR debts. His \ndelinquent debts occurred under such circumstances that they are likely to recur and \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of his unemployment and underemployment. He does not \nreceive full mitigating credit because he has been continuously employed at a salary of \n$51,500 since February 2008. He did not establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \nApplicant received information about debt resolution from his church and DCC, \nconstituting some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). I have credited Applicant with payment \nof the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($25), 1.f ($65), and 1.g ($209). He has also \nestablished some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed some, \nrecent good faith3 in the resolution of his SOR debts. I credit him with making some \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \npayments to DCC. Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of \nany debts and AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. He did not establish that he maintained contact \nwith his creditors, or that he made or attempted to make partial payments to them. His \noverall recent conduct with his creditors shows he did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances.4 He said he was using a plan developed with DCC to pay his four large \ndelinquent debts. As part of his SOR response, he provided photocopies of the fronts of \nfive checks to corroborate his statement that he had an established payment plan. \nWhen additional information about those checks was requested, he initially failed to \nrespond or provided evasive responses. Eventually, he admitted that he did not pay \nDCC the amounts indicated on his checks.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \n \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is summarized in this \nparagraph; however, it is insufficient to mitigate security concerns. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His security clearance application \ndid not disclose any problems with alcohol or drug abuse. His financial problems were \ninitially caused by unemployment and underemployment, which are factors largely \nbeyond his control. He paid three SOR debts. He pays his non-SOR debts, including his \nmortgage. He has a plan to pay his other SOR debts. He has not received any new \ncredit cards. Applicant has achieved some important educational and employment \ngoals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility, and dedication. He briefly served \non active duty in the Army. He obtained employment with his current employer in \nFebruary 2008. He understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his \nfinancial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and \ntrustworthiness through his service to the Department of Defense as a contractor. He \nsupports his family and is paying his child support. These factors, especially his past \ngovernment service, show sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to provide important \nmitigation.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct is more substantial. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent more than five years ago. In February \n2008, he began his present employment as an employee of a government contractor \nand his pay was increased to an annual salary of $51,500. Applicant said in his SOR \nresponse that the four debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($2,070), 1.b ($3,791), 1.c ($4,167), and 1.d \n($12,232), totaling $22,260, were \u201cpart of [DCC\u2019s] settlement package.\u201d These four \ndebts constitute 98 percent of the total SOR debt. As part of his SOR response, he \nprovided checks showing $343 payments to DCC from October 1, 2008, to February 1, \n2009. A reasonable inference is that for five months he had made payments into his \ndebt consolidation plan. Eventually, he admitted this was false and that these five \npayments were not made. He claimed the five checks were submitted to DCC; however, \nhe admitted these five checks were never cashed.  \n \nHe should have made greater progress on these four debts. He should have \nacted more aggressively to pay his delinquent debts, to pay into his debt \nconsolidation/resolution program, and to better document his remedial efforts. Most \nimportantly, he should have ensured his documentation was accurate, and his post- \nhearing statements were candid and forthright. These factors show some financial \nirresponsibility and a significant lack of judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e to 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused in part\nby a job loss.  To address his financial situation, Applicant entered into a relationship with a debt\nconsolidation company.  Applicant submitted to the Judge five checks that he claimed he had sent\nto this company in payment for its services.  However, he subsequently stated that he had informed\nthe company to shred the checks and that they had not actually been cashed.  In deciding the case\nadversely to Applicant, the Judge stated that Applicant \u201cshould have acted more aggressively to pay\nhis delinquent debts[.]\u201d  Decision at 10.  \n In support of his appeal Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the record,\nfor example three credit reports dated September 8, 2009.  The Board cannot consider this new\nevidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal\nBoard\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  Applicant contends that\nthe Judge did not consider evidence which he believes to be favorable to his case.  For example, he\ncontends that the Judge did not read his contract with the debt consolidation company.  However,\na Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-\n00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).\nApplicant\u2019s appeal presentation is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.\nApplicant points to favorable language in the Judge\u2019s decision which, inter alia,\nacknowledges that Applicant has paid off certain debts not listed in the SOR, that he has never had\na security violation, that he is a law-abiding citizen and good family member, and that his financial\nproblems were \u201cinitially caused by unemployment and underemployment[.]\u201d Decision at 10.\nApplicant believes that these comments by the Judge are inconsistent with his unfavorable decision.\nHowever, the Judge went on to say that these favorable matters are outweighed by evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s lack of judgement in the management of his financial affairs and other evidence which\nthe Judge reasonably concluded detracted significantly from Applicant\u2019s credibility.  Read in context,\nthe comments which Applicant has cited merely demonstrate that the Judge considered the full range\nof potentially mitigating evidence contained in the file but concluded that such evidence was not\nsufficient to establish that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion.  \n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nconclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the \nguideline for financial considerations. Accordingly, her request for a security \nclearance is granted. \n \n \nOn February 26, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance \napplication (Standard Form 86) to request a security clearance required as part \n \n 1  \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n \n 2  \n                                                     \nof her employment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results \nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative \nfinding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nrequest.  \n \n \nOn December 10, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns \naddressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations) of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). Applicant received the SOR (Item 1) on \nJanuary 7, 2009 (Item 3). She signed her Answer to the SOR (Item 4) on January \n13, 2009, in which she denied allegations 1.c., 1.k., 1.l., 1.n., and 1.o., and \nadmitted all other allegations. She requested an administrative decision without a \nhearing.  \n \nOn January 30, 2009, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of \nrelevant material (FORM)2 in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. \nApplicant was given 30 days from the date she received the FORM to file a \nresponse. The file does not contain a response from Applicant. The case was \nassigned to me on March 3, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After \na thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nFORM submitted by the Government, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. She married in 1991 and divorced in 1995. She \nreceives $85 per month in child support for her son, who is now 14 years old. \nShe received a Masters degree in 2006. Between 2000 and 2002, she worked as \na secretary to a school principal. She also worked as a 5th grade teacher for six \nmonths from 2001 to 2002. From January to May 2002, she was unemployed. \nShe held a temporary clerical position between January 2003 and January 2004. \nApplicant was unemployed from January to May 2004. Between 2005 and 2007, \nshe performed clerical work for two different defense contracting companies, \nworking on-site at the same federal agency. She again became unemployed from \nMay 2007 to January 2008. At that point, she began working for her present \nemployer, and completed her security clearance application in February 2008 (all \nfacts from Item 5). \n \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00a7 E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1-8) \nproffered I support of the government's case. \n\n \n 3  \n \nA number of events affected Applicant's financial status. She maintained a \ndepartment store credit card (allegation 1.m.) in the late 1980s, but after her \ndivorce in 1995, debt started to accumulate on the card (Item 6). It became \ndelinquent in 2001 (Item 8). Applicant also suffered an accident in August 2006, \nwhich resulted in the total loss of her car. Needing transportation, she rented a \ncar for three months. She was unable to pay for both the rental and the payments \non her damaged car. She contacted the loan company to request adding the \nbalance on the damaged car to a new loan for a replacement car, but the loan \ncompany refused. Finally, Applicant had \"a lot of medical bills or debts that was \n(sic) incurred while employed with no medical insurance.\" (Item 4). She provided \nno further evidence about her medical condition, but did add a hand-written note \nto her credit bureau report indicating that she was treated at a hospital in 2005 \nfor a blood clot (Item 6, page 21).  \n \n \n  When Applicant became unemployed in May 2007, she was able to keep \nup with her bills for several months. When she could no longer pay her bills, she \nand her son became homeless from August 2007 to January 2008 (Item 6). They \nlived in motels and with a friend during this time period (Item 5). Applicant also \nlived with a friend during part of her unemployed period in 2004 (Item 1). \n \n \nApplicant now earns an hourly wage of $11.60. According to her wage \nstatement dated July 27, 2008, her gross weekly pay is $590; after deductions, \nher net weekly pay is $451, or approximately $1800 per month. She receives \n$85.62 per week ($342 per month) in child support, which brings her net monthly \nincome to $2,142. Based on these figures, her net annual income is \napproximately $25,700. As of August 2008, Applicant's monthly expenses for \nrent, food, utilities, car payment, and miscellaneous expenses (tithe and daily \nlunch) amount to $2,150. She pays $375 per month on one debt, leaving a \nnegative monthly remainder of $351 (Item 6). As of August 2008, she was unable \nto pay on any other delinquencies (Item 4, page 4) and her \"main priority at this \ntime is trying to keep my family out of the streets by paying my rent\u2026\" (Item 6, \npage 3).  \n \n \nApplicant admits to ten of the SOR debts, which total almost $14,000. She \ndenies the remaining debts, which total $357 (Items 1, 4, 7, and 8). Although \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.c., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.n., she placed a question \nmark after each admission. The government, in its FORM, construed these \n\"hesitant admissions\" as denials (FORM, page 2), and I concur. Applicant \nunequivocally denied allegation 1.o., a $28 debt to a book club, which she has \npaid (Item 4). Most of the debts alleged in the SOR remain unpaid. However, \nApplicant has been paying on her auto loan (allegation 1.j.) since obtaining \nemployment in January 2008 and is \"working toward getting that current\" (Item \n6). She has reduced the delinquency from $734 in February 2008 (Item 8) to \n$187, or one month overdue, as of December 2008 (Item 7). Applicant also made \na payment of $100 in February 2008 on her student loan (allegation 1.h.) (Item \n\n \n 4  \n                                                     \n6). No new delinquencies have occurred since she returned to work a little more \nthan one year ago (Item 7).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-\nsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and material \ninformation, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect \nconsideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred \nto as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does \nnot determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of \naccess to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and \nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial considerations) at AG \n\u00b6 18. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest4 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. \nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a \nheavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access to classified information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring \neach Applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect \nthe national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.6 \n \n \n \n3 Directive 6.3 \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 5  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial \nconsiderations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a \nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence in the FORM supports application of disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history \nof not meeting financial obligations). By her own admission, Applicant has been \nunable to pay her debts, which have been accumulating since 2002, indicating a \nhistory of failure to meet financial obligations. \n \n \nThe financial considerations guideline contains factors that can potentially \nmitigate security concerns. The relevant mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 20 (b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances).  \n \n \nApplicant experienced a series of events that were beyond her control and \nleft her unable to handle the family debts. After her divorce in 1995, she \nsupported herself and her one-year-old baby. She received only $85 per week in \nchild support (Items 5 and 6), but managed to support her family. Her debts did \nnot become delinquent for several years (Item 7). But other events affected her \nability to remain solvent. Applicant had numerous medical debts, including \nhospitalization for a blood clot in 2005. Although her medical expenses were \nincurred while she was working, she was not covered by health insurance. Her \nauto accident in 2006 deprived her of a car, requiring her expend her limited \nresources to pay for both her car loan and a rental car. Finally, she was \nunemployed on three separate occasions: from January to May 2002; again from \nJanuary to May 2004, and finally, from May 2007 to January 2008. The last \nunemployment resulted in Applicant and her son becoming homeless for six \nmonths. Twice while she was unemployed, she moved in with friends (Item 5, \n\n \n 6  \npages 1 and 2). During these periods of unemployment, half of the debts became \ndelinquent: allegations 1.c. and 1.g. in 2002; allegation 1.l. in 2004; and \nallegations 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 1.n. and 1.o. between 2007 and 2008. The remaining \ndelinquencies accrued in 2005 and 2006, while she was under-employed as a \ncontractor clerical worker.  \n \n \nApplicant acted responsibly during these unforeseen events. She moved \nin with friends when her unemployment deprived her of funds for housing. She \nstayed employed as much as possible, accepting clerical work although it \nrepresented under-employment for her education level. She has not been able to \npay many of her debts, but she has not incurred new debts since gaining \nemployment in 2008. I find that she has been spending her limited income \nresponsibly to pay basic living expenses in order to keep her family \"out of the \nstreets\" in the face of numerous hardships that she could not control. AG \u00b6 20 (b) \napplies. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate \nthe Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and \nhave applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have \nalso reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and her actions to support herself and her son \nshow that she is a mature, responsible adult. In struggling to keep her family \nafloat since her divorce, she experienced three periods of unemployment \nbetween 2002 and 2008. Eight of her debts became delinquent during these \nperiods. The remaining debts became delinquent while she was under-employed \nas a clerical worker in 2005 and 2006. Her failure to resolve her debts stems not \nfrom drug or alcohol abuse, gambling, or excessive spending, but from the fact \nthat she has been either unemployed or under-employed, earning a salary that \nallows her to meet only basic living expenses. Applicant has shown no \nindications of dishonesty or untrustworthiness. She was forthright with the \ngovernment in admitting her debts on her security clearance application, and her \n\n \n 7  \ntrustworthiness is not at issue. A fair and common-sense assessment of the \navailable information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance \nshows she has satisfied the doubts about her ability and willingness to protect \nthe government\u2019s interests. Accordingly, I find it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by \nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.p. \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\n\n3\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nApplicant alleges bias on the part of the Judge.  In particular, Applicant points to comments\nthe Judge made expressing skepticism about Applicant\u2019s testimony as to his abilities in physical\nfitness tests.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge acts in a fair and impartial manner, and\na party seeking to rebut that presumption has a very heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g.,ISCR\nCase No. 02-15003 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar 17, 2005).  When reviewing claims of bias or prejudice, the\nstandard is not whether the appealing party believes the Judge was biased or prejudiced, but rather\nwhether there is any indication in the record of the proceedings below (including the Judge\u2019s\ndecision) that would lead a disinterested person to reasonably question the Judge\u2019s fairness and\nimpartiality.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-33169 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 23, 2004).  A statement in\nwhich the Judge questions an applicant\u2019s credibility is not by itself indicative of bias.  Nothing in\nthe record of the proceedings below indicates anything that would lead a disinterested person\nreasonably to question the Judge\u2019s  fairness and impartiality in this case.\nApplicant questions the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  A Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations are entitled to deference on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  At the hearing, the\nJudge had the opportunity to personally observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and that of the other\nwitnesses when they testified and to form impressions as to their credibility.  Applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s negative assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility and his positive\nassessment of the credibility of other witnesses is not sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion.\nApplicant questions whether a government witness qualified to testify as an expert witness\nregarding the Marine Corps\u2019 drug testing procedures and whether those procedures were followed\nin Applicant\u2019s case. Although the subject was not explicitly discussed at the hearing, the Board will\nassume for the purposes of this appeal that Applicant was testifying as an expert.  At the time the\nwitness testified, Applicant did not challenge the witness\u2019s expertise.  In cross-examining the\nwitness, Applicant asked questions consistent with acceptance of the witness\u2019s knowledge of the\nprocedures used in drug testing.  Applicant did object on other grounds which are not raised on\nappeal.  The Board concludes that Applicant waived any objection based on the witness\u2019s expertise.\nEven if the issue had not been waived, we conclude that the witness did not testify as to matters\noutside his competence.  \nApplicant contends that the government did not meet its burden of production with regard\nto the drug tests and did not demonstrate a nexus between alleged behavior and a legitimate security\nconcern.  The record demonstrates that on two separate occasions Applicant tested positive for illegal\ndrugs, in one instance marijuana and in the other ecstacy.  Applicant\u2019s urine was, on both occasions,\nsubjected to an initial screening test.  The positive results were then confirmed by gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry, which \u201cis the most accurate, sensitive, and reliable method of\ntesting[.]\u201d Applicant Exhibit P at 2.  On both occasions Applicant\u2019s test results exceeded the cutoffs\nestablished by DoD policy.  Government Exhibits 2, 4.  Additionally, Applicant stated to the OPM\n\n4\ninvestigator that, prior to the positive marijuana urinalysis, he had attended a party at which\nmarijuana was being used.  His claim of passive inhalation of marijuana smoke implicitly\nacknowledges the accuracy of the subsequent urine test.  The record demonstrates that the\ngovernment has presented substantial evidence as to the allegations in the SOR.  Once the\ngovernment demonstrates a security concern, the burden is on an applicant to mitigate or rebut the\nconcern; the Directive presumes there is a nexus between proven conduct under any of the guidelines\nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08113 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 15,\n2008); and ISCR Case No. 03-18523 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 16, 2005).  The record supports the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions in this regard.  Furthermore, there is a presumption of good faith and regularity by\nfederal officials in the fulfillment of their duties.  Applicant failed to rebut that presumption.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his application of mitigating conditions and in his\nwhole-person analysis.  The Board finds that the Judge\u2019s discussion of mitigating conditions and the\nwhole-person concept reflect a reasonable analysis of the sustainable findings of security concern,\nand the Board sees no reason to disturb them.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10008 at 2 (App. Bd.\nDec. 29, 2009).\nApplicant questions whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and his adverse conclusions,\nincluding a conclusion that Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application, are\nsustainable in light of the record as a whole.  After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the\nJudge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterization\nor inferences that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-24013 at 2 (App.\nBd. May 23, 2008).  The Judge met the standard discussed above by examining the relevant data and\narticulating a satisfactory explanation for his decision.  The Judge\u2019s decision is therefore sustainable.\nAlternatively, Applicant requests that the case be remanded to obtain further testimony\nregarding Applicant\u2019s positive drug tests and to establish proper testing procedures by the Naval\nDrug Testing Laboratory.  A full hearing on Applicant\u2019s case was already held, and the Board is\nwithout authority to regulate the procedures of the Naval Drug Testing Laboratory.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.                     \n                                                                       \nSigned: Michael Y.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Erick M. Ferran, Esquire\nSeptember 18, 2009\nDecision\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn October 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nH and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 12, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 16, 2009. DOHA initially issued a Notice of Hearing on March 30, 2009, and the\nhearing was scheduled on April 28, 2009. As a result of the attorneys\u2019 request, the\nhearing was continued. A second Notice of Hearing was issued on April 22, 2009, and\nthe hearing convened, as scheduled on June 2, 2009, in Las Vegas Nevada.  \nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without\nobjection. Two witnesses testified on behalf of the Government. Applicant testified on\n\n2\nhis own behalf, and he submitted Exhibits A through P, which were admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June 10, 2009. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant\nand the other witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is not married, and he has one child. He has\nreceived two years of college education. He served in the United States Marines Corps\n(USMC) from 1998 to 2006. Applicant works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe testimony of two witnesses and the Applicant will be reviewed, before it is\napplied to the SOR allegations. Two witnesses from the Marine Corps testified, at the\nrequest of Department Counsel, to explain and give insights to the methods used by the\nMarine Corps to administer drug testing, in general, and to provide any specific\ninformation available, regarding the specific results of drug tests taken by Applicant,\nwhen he was in the Marines. \nWitness 1\nThe first witness identified himself as a 25 year old, active duty sergeant, who\nhas been in the Marine Corps for almost six years. Part of the duties of Witness 1 for\nalmost the last 3 years included being the substance abuse control officer (SACO), for\nwhich he indicated that had been thoroughly trained. His duties included conducting\nurinalysis tests every month, and he estimated that he has conducted \u201ca couple\nhundred tests\u201d (Tr at 28). Witness 1 testified, not as to the specifics of the tests received\nby Applicant while in the Marines, but rather to explain the techniques used consistently\nby all Marines, and to interpret the results of tests taken by Applicant, which were\nentered into evidence.\nWitness 1 testified as to the procedures used to test each Marine throughout the\nMarine Corps, for potential drug usage, which are always the same and are extremely\nthorough and careful, to make certain that no errors are made in the process (Tr at 36-\n38). He thereafter explained the results of several of the documents that were identified\nand entered into evidence as Exhibit 4. The first document reviewed by Witness 1 was\nfrom the Naval Drug Screening Lab, which identified all drugs that are tested and the\namount necessary to be found in the blood stream to be tested positive or the Cutoff\nValue (Tr at 33-34).  A second document was the \u201cResults Report for USMC.\u201d This\nreport identified that Applicant tested positive for THC (Marijuana) in the amount of 28\nnanograms per millileter (npl) in February 2006. Since 15 npl is the minimum amount\nrequired to test positive (Cutoff Value), the amount identified in Applicant was almost\ntwo times that amount. In a second \u201cResults Report for USMC\u201d Applicant tested positive\n\n3\nfor MDMA (Ecstacy) in the amount of 1542 nanograms in September 2005. Since 500\nnanograms is the Cutoff Value, the amount identified in Applicant was more than three\ntimes that amount. \nFinally, Witness 1 testified that, as the SACO officer, it is his duty to notify the\nOfficer in Charge if there are positive results on drug tests, but since he was not the\nSACO when the tests were performed on Applicant, he could not testify whether or not\nthat procedure was carried out (Tr at 67).\nWitness 2\nWitness 2 identified himself as a staff sergeant, who has been in the Marine\nCorps for eight years, and whose occupational specialty is as an administrative\npersonnel chief, where he performs human resources functions.  He testified that a\nreview of Applicant\u2019s military records showed he received a urinalysis on his last drill\nweekend, prior to his medical discharge from the Marines (Tr at 91-93). He further\nstated that when Marines tested positive on drug tests, the rest of the troop was\nsometimes made aware of the results of the test, although he was not certain if that was\nthe proper Marine policy (Tr at 112). \nWitness 2 also testified that he was the observer who was present during\nApplicant\u2019s urinalyses, making sure that Applicant properly provided the urine for each\ntest and returned it to the SACO without any contamination or error (Tr at 113-114). \nApplicant\nAs stated above, Applicant served for 6 years in the Marines. He was deployed in\nIraq and ultimately received a medical honorable discharge, because of an injury he\nsustained to his L5-S1 disk from driving a LVS vehicle for long periods of time while in\nIraq (Tr at 161-162). Despite his medical discharge, Applicant did testify that for his\ncurrent employment, he has certain physical requirements. He has to be able to run\nthree miles in 22 minutes, but he stated that he runs it in 16 minutes. He also has had to\nperform 20 or 30 push-ups and 60 sit-ups in two minutes (Tr at 149). For an individual,\nwho had to leave the Marines because of a disability, to perform in this clearly superior\nphysical manner, seems rather unlikely, particularly since Applicant contends that he\nexperiences constant pain from his injury and received a subsequent surgery. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that his disability was rated as 50% (Tr at 194).\nHowever, a letter, dated January 26, 2006, from the Inspector/Officer in Charge\nregarding Applicant\u2019s \u201cDischarge From the United States Marine Corps Reserve With\nSeverance Pay\u201d clearly contradicts Applicant\u2019s assertion (Exhibit A) . It indicates that\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cdisability is rated at ten percent.\u201d\nApplicant testified that he has been employed by his current employer for five\nyears, and during that time he has undergone two saliva drug tests, and he has never\nbeen informed of any positive drug results (Tr at 148-149). No evidence was introduced\nregarding the results of drug tests from his current employer. \n\n4\nApplicant testified that he used marijuana when he was 17, but he did not use it\nagain after that time (Tr at 171). When he competed the Security Clearance Application\n(SCA), he answered \u201cNo\" to question 24, indicating that he had not used any illegal\nsubstance in the last seven years, and at the hearing, he testified that he was being\nhonest when he furnished this answer. He also averred that he was not aware when he\ncompleted the SCA, that he had received two positive drug tests (Tr at 174-175).\nApplicant did concede that he had heard from a few former fellow Marines that\nhe had tested positive for drugs, and while he claimed that he thought it must be a joke,\nhe stated that he called his former first sergeant, who informed him that he was not\naware of Applicant testing positive (Tr at 181-184). Finally, Applicant claimed that he\nhad been present where marijuana was being used, on the day before the test, and he\nposited a theory indicating that may have been why he tested positive for marijuana.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR originally listed one allegation regarding illegal drug involvement under\nAdjudicative Guideline H (1.a.). As a result of the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend the\nSOR, an additional allegation (1.b.) was added under Guideline H:\n1.a. The SOR alleges that in February 2006, Applicant tested positive for\nmarijuana on a mandatory United State Marine Corps (USMC) drug test.  Exhibit 4 and\nthe testimony of Witnesses 1 and 2 clearly establish that Applicant tested positive on\nFebruary 12, 2006, for THC (marijuana) in the amount of 28 npm, which is almost twice\nthe cutoff value of 15 npm. Although Applicant denied ever using marijuana while he\nwas in the Marines, I find the methods and techniques of the drug tests administered  by\nthe Marines, including the chain of custody, as explained by Witnesses 1 and 2, to be\nextremely reliable and accurate, and far more credible and persuasive than Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony and his ultimate denial of drug usage. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant did\nuse the marijuana for which he tested positive. \n1.b. The SOR alleges that \u201cIn or around September of 2005, Applicant used\nMDMA (Ecstasy).\u201d  Exhibit 4 and the testimony of Witnesses 1 and 2 also clearly\nestablish that Applicant tested positive on September 11, 2005, for MDMA (Ecstacy) in\nthe amount of 1542 npm, which is more than three times the cutoff value of 500 npm.\nApplicant also denied ever using MDMA while he was in the Marines. However, again, I\nfind the methods and techniques of the drug tests administered  by the Marines, to be\nextremely reliable and accurate, and far more credible and persuasive than Applicant\u2019s\ndenial. I also conclude that Applicant used the MDMA for which he tested positive. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline) E - Personal Conduct)\nThe SOR originally listed 1 allegation (2.a.) under Adjudicative Guideline E. As a\nresult of the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR, two additional allegations were\nadded under Guideline H (2.b. and 2.c.):\n\n5\n2.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on a SCA, which he\nexecuted on April 11, 2006 (Exhibit 1). Question #24 a. of the SCA asked since the age\nof 16 or in the previous seven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant illegally used\nany controlled substance? The Government alleges that Applicant should have\ndisclosed that he tested positive for marijuana in February 2006. I do not find that the\nquestion, as it is worded, calls for an answer that would disclose that Applicant tested\npositive for any drug. However, since I have found that the drug test that Applicant\nunderwent was accurate, and he did use marijuana in 2006, then Applicant had the duty\nto inform the Government of his marijuana usage on the SCA, which he failed to do.\n2.b. The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on the SCA (Exhibit\n1), in that Applicant should have disclosed, in response to Question 24 a., that he used\nMDMA (Ecstasy) in September 2005. Since I have also found that Applicant used\nMDMA in 2005, then Applicant had the duty to inform the Government of this drug\nusage on the SCA, which he also failed to do.\n2.c. The SOR alleges that while Applicant was a \u201cmember of the USMC reserves,\n[n he] wrongfully used a controlled substance on at least two separate occasions.\u201d As\nreviewed above, I find that Applicant did use a controlled substance on at least two\nseparate occasions as a USMC Reserve, which exhibited questionable judgement.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J- Criminal Conduct)\nThe SOR originally did not list any allegation under Adjudicative Guideline J. As a\nresult of the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR, two allegations were added\nunder Guideline J (3.a. and 3.b.). The Government alleges in this paragraph that\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct: \n3.a. The SOR alleges that \u201cIn or around February of 2006 [Applicant] used\nMarijuana.\u201d I find that Applicant\u2019s marijuana usage constitutes criminal conduct.  \n3.b. The SOR alleges that \u201cIn or around September of 2005 [Applicant] used\nMDMA (Ecstasy).\u201d I also find that Applicant\u2019s MDMA usage constitutes criminal conduct.\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a number of documents in an attempt to mitigate the\nallegations in the SOR. Exhibits A through D detail the record of Applicant\u2019s Marine\nservice and confirm that he did receive an Honorable Discharge. Exhibit A specifically\nshowed that Applicant received a discharge by reason of physical disability. His total\nactive service was 1 year 7 months, and his reserve time was 5 years 7 months, and as\nreviewed above, his disability was rated as ten percent. Applicant also offered into\nevidence eight character letters from individuals, who know or have known him in his\nprofessional or private life, and many who consider him a friend (Exhibits F through M).\nThese letters were extremely laudatory in describing Applicant\u2019s high integrity, reliability,\nand good judgement. \n\n6\nApplicant also introduced three different articles about drug tests and their\naccuracy. The first was by a criminal defense lawyer to the National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers (Exhibit N), the second was titled \u201cInvestigation of\nInterference by Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Urine Tests for Abused Drugs\u201d\n(Exhibit O), and the third was \u201cUrine Drug Screening: Practical Guide for Clinicians\u201d\n(Exhibit P). All of these articles analyzed different aspects of drug tests, including their\nflaws and whether they should be allowed into evidence. I reviewed them in great detail.\nHowever none of the objections to drug testing, discussed in these articles, convince\nme that the drug tests used in this case were not applicable, relevant or accurate.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n7\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession and use of\nmarijuana and MDMA, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to\nthe nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse\nfalls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug abuse) and\n(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use).\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s lack of candor in the information about his drug\ninvolvement that he furnished to the Government, I cannot conclude at this time that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct comes within any Mitigating Condition (MC). Accordingly,\nParagraph 1, Guideline H, of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant executed a\nSCA on April 11, 2006, in which he failed to identify that he had used marijuana or\nMDMA.  \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that\nDC 16. (a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, and\nfalsification of relevant facts from a personnel security questionnaire, which was used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility. I cannot find that any Mitigating Condition (MC)\napplies in this paragraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 2, Guideline E, against Applicant.\n\n8\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government also established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct, by\nusing illegal substances while in the USMC. Additionally, while it is not alleged in the\nSOR, Applicant\u2019s knowingly providing false and misleading information to the\nGovernment on a SCA is also a criminal act, although it will not be considered adversely\nto the Applicant under this guideline. \nDC 31. (a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this\ncase. DC 31. (c), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, is also applicable to this case. While MC 32. (a) could\nbe argued to apply under Criminal Conduct, because so much time has allegedly\nelapsed sine the criminal conduct. However, since Applicant has not acknowledged his\nconduct, I do not find that this condition mitigates this concern. Paragraph 3, Guideline J\nis found against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines H, E, and J, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply\nand the Mitigating Conditions do not, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsignificant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns set forth in this SOR. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order,\nDoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 20, 2009. The\nSOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the\nJune 29, 2009\n\n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n2\nherein. \n2\naction. The issues in this case fall under Guideline H for drug involvement and\nGuideline G for alcohol consumption. \nApplicant\u2019s one-page response to the SOR is dated February 25, 2009. He\nadmitted all the allegations as set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.x and 2.a\u20132.h. He also stated\nthat he did not want a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn April 16, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant and received by him on April 22,\n2\n2009. He did not submit a documentary response to the FORM within the allowed 30-\nday period. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2009. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, this case is decided against Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a federal contractor. In 1979, he earned a\nBS in mathematics and a BS in electrical engineering from an institute of technology. He\nbegan his current employment as an engineer for a company in September 2003. He is\ndivorced and has a daughter (born in 1985), a son (born in 1987), and a stepdaughter\n(born in 1977). \nApplicant admitted a history of drug abuse. He used cocaine and crack cocaine,\nsometimes daily, for about 28 years (1977 to 2005). He used marijuana for about 31\nyears (1971 to 2002). And he used a variety of other illegal drugs or misused\nprescription drugs with varying frequency during the period 2000\u20132002. He was\ndiagnosed with polysubstance dependency (crack, alcohol, XTC, etc.) and\npolysubstance abuse (heroin, amphetamines, tranquilizers, ketamine, nitrous oxide,\nmarijuana) in 2002 (Exhibit 7). He was fired from his job as an engineer in 2001 due to\njob performance and attendance issues related to his use of drugs. Also in 2001, he\nwas arrested and charged with possession of cannabis and possession of drug\nparaphernalia, to which he pleaded no contest and was placed on probation for 12\nmonths. He received treatment for his drug usage in 2002 and again in 2004\u20132005. He\nhad two accidental drug overdoses and was taken to the hospital in 2004. He used\ncocaine in 2005 after his period of treatment.\nApplicant admitted a history of excessive alcohol consumption. He has drunk\nalcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from about 1968 to about\nMarch 2008. He was twice charged with drunk driving (1975 and 1981).

He\nreceived treatment during 2004\u20132005 for that dependency. Previously, he had received\ntreatment for his use of alcohol in 1992 and 1993. \nApplicant was interviewed as part of the background investigation in March 2008\n(Exhibit 6). He reported stopping all use of drugs in September 2005 by a combination\nof abstaining, attending Narcotics Anonymous, and no longer associating with people\ninvolved in drugs. He reported that he does not intend to use drugs in the future. He\nreported that he continues to drink alcohol (one to two drinks on rare occasion), and he\nstated that he never had a problem with alcohol.\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nThe SOR here alleges two security guidelines, which are described below.\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n14\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d15\nUnder Guideline G for alcohol consumption,  the security concern is that\n16\n\u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n17\n5\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, this case raises serious security\nconcerns. For example, the disqualifying information includes the following: (1) a history\nof drug abuse (cocaine and marijuana) over a period of decades; (2) a diagnosis of\npolysubstance dependency involving both cocaine and alcohol in 2002 and continued\nuse of both substances following the diagnosis; (3) a job loss tied to his drug use; (4) a\ndrug-related criminal case for which he served probation for 12 months; and (5) a\nhistory of excessive consumption of alcohol, to include alcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work (twice being charged with DUI). \nThe various mitigating conditions under the two guidelines have been reviewed\nand considered in light of the record evidence as a whole, and the evidence is not\nsufficient to mitigate and overcome the security concerns. For Guideline H, the evidence\nis insufficient due to the length and frequency of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse. For Guideline\nG, the evidence is insufficient because Applicant continues to drink alcohol\nnotwithstanding his history of problems with alcohol. Taken together, the evidence as a\nwhole paints a picture of a 51-year-old man who has demonstrated a long-term pattern\nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability. These circumstances\nraise questions and doubts about his suitability for access to classified information. \nUnder the whole-person concept,  an administrative judge must evaluate a\n17\nperson\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the person\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole and giving it due consideration\nunder the whole-person concept, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Although it appears Applicant has\nmade progress in dealing with his history of substance abuse, it is simply too soon to tell\nif Applicant\u2019s substance abuse is a thing of the past that will not recur. Applicant did not\nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This\ncase is decided against Applicant. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u2013h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.    \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. 3 Applicant married his current spouse (W2) in April 2007 (see exs. 1 and 3) and has two minor children from his marriage to W1 (see exs. 1 and 3). He earned a bachelors degree in information technology November 2004 (ex. 1). In October 2004, Applicant and his significant other at the time (S) purchased a home together for the price of around of $285,000.000 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 66). Applicant and S initially took out two loans with a lender (L1): a first deed to cover 80 per cent of the purchase price (approximately $225,000.00), and 20 per cent to cover the remaining 20 percent of the loan (approximately $57,000.00) (R.T., at 60-61, 65-69). Because Applicant did not document his home purchase, the details of his loans cannot be validated. Generally, Applicant and S agreed to split the monthly mortgage payments on a 50-50 basis (see ex. 3). Shortly after Applicant and S purchased their home, L1 sold its first mortgage interest in Applicant\u2019s property to L2 (see exs. 4 and 5). L1 continued to hold its second mortgage on Applicant\u2019s property.

The case was assigned to me on February 18, 2009, and was scheduled for\nhearing on March 23, 2009.  The case was convened hearing on the scheduled date as\nscheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security\nclearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant\nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nrelied on one witness (himself).  The transcript (R.T.) was received April 3, 2009.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nPrior to the presentation of the evidence, Applicant requested leave to amend her\nanswer to deny any intentional falsification of his security clearance application (e-QIP).\nThere being no objection from Department counsel, and for good cause demonstrated,\nfrom Applicant, Applicant\u2019s request was granted.  Applicant\u2019s answer, in turn, was\namended by inter-lineation to reflect Applicant\u2019s denial of any deliberate intent to falsify\nhis e-QIP.\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with payment documentation and any legal deficiency protections available to\nhim under State law .  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days (to\nMarch 30, 2009) to supplement the record with documented payments and legal\nprotections available to him on a foreclosed second mortgage covered in the SOR. The\nGovernment was afforded three days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nprovided copies of e-mails, correspondence pertaining to his debts with creditors 1.b\nand 1.c and cancelled checks covering creditor 1.c., but nothing pertaining to the listed\nsecond mortgage deficiency.  Department counsel did not object to the admission of the\nsubmissions.  The submissions were admitted as exhibits A through C.    \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated (a) a charged off\n$123,419.26 second mortgage in June 2006 (foreclosed in April 2008) and (b) four other\ndelinquent debts exceeding $13,000.00. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his e-QIP of January\n2008 by omitting his mortgage delinquencies over 180 and 90 days delinquent,\nrespectively. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. He\nprovided no explanations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\n\n3\nApplicant married his current spouse (W2) in April 2007 (see exs. 1 and 3) and\nhas two minor children from his marriage to W1 (see exs. 1 and 3).  He earned a\nbachelors degree in information technology November 2004 (ex. 1).\nIn October 2004, Applicant and his significant other at the time (S) purchased a\nhome together for the price of around of $285,000.000 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 66).\nApplicant and S initially took out two loans with a lender (L1): a first deed to cover 80\nper cent of the purchase price (approximately $225,000.00), and 20 per cent to cover\nthe remaining 20 percent of the loan (approximately $57,000.00) (R.T., at 60-61, 65-69).\nBecause Applicant did not document his home purchase, the details of his loans cannot\nbe validated.  Generally, Applicant and S agreed to split the monthly mortgage\npayments on a 50-50 basis (see ex. 3).  \nShortly after Applicant and S purchased their home, L1 sold its first mortgage\ninterest in Applicant\u2019s property to L2 (see exs. 4 and 5).  L1 continued to hold its second\nmortgage on Applicant\u2019s property.  Under the terms of the adjustable interest rate in\ntheir first mortgage, the rate was scheduled to accelerate in two years from an initial 5\n3/4 per cent rate to an 8 per cent rate (R.T., at 73-74).\n In June 2005, Applicant refinanced his second mortgage with L3, and replaced\nhis $57,000.00 mortgage with a $123,000.00 second mortgage (see exs. 3, 4 and 5;\nR.T., at 61-65, 69-70).  They used the extra money to repay other credit cards and\npurchase a vehicle (R.T., at 71-72).\nApplicant and S split up in September 2006 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 42-46).  Applicant\nvacated the home, and S continued to live in the home for a number of months (R.T., at\n40). However, Applicant and S continued to make their monthly payments on both\nmortgages through April 2007 (see exs. 3, 4 and 5).  After April 2007, Applicant and S\nquit making payments on their second mortgage (R.T., at 75-79), and ceased making\npayments on their first mortgage after July 2007 (see exs. 4 and 5; R.T., at 58-59, 77-\n79).\nApplicant was notified after July 2007 by his first mortgage holder L1 that\nforeclosure procedures would be initiated in late 2007 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 89-90).\nRecords indicate that L1 assigned its first mortgage to L4 in February 2008 (see ex. 2).\nL4, in turn, initiated foreclosure procedures in March 2008, and foreclosed on\nApplicant\u2019s first the following month (see ex. 3; R.T., at 48-51).  At the scheduled\nforeclosure sale, L4 reportedly purchased Applicant\u2019s property for an undisclosed\namount (see ex. 3; R.T., at 90-91). \nApplicant was advised by letter of the impending foreclosure sale by L4 in 2008,\nbut has received no sale information or payment demands from the foreclosing creditor\nsince the earlier 2008 foreclosure (R.T., at 91-92).  At this time he can provide no\nassurances of any safe standing from potential deficiency claims by this foreclosing first\nmortgage holder.  He really does not know whether he is obligated for any deficiency on\nhis first mortgage.  \n\n4\nRecords indicate that L3\u2019s second mortgage was legally foreclosed as a result of\nthe first mortgage holder\u2019s foreclosure of Applicant\u2019s home in April 2008 (see exs. 3, 4\nand 5; R.T., at 78-79).  Applicant has not heard anything from L3 since the foreclosure,\nand does not know whether L3 still owns the second mortgage or whether he owes any\ndeficiency on this foreclosed second mortgage (see ex. 3; R.T., at  92-93, 116-120).  \nBesides his mortgage debts, Applicant accumulated four other delinquent debts\nin 2007 (see exs. 2, 4 and 5). The four listed delinquent debts in the SOR (creditors 1.b\nthrough 1.e exceed $13,000.00.  These debts became delinquent in 2007, during a\nperiod when Applicant\u2019s finances were stretched by increased child support payments\nto W1 (R.T., at 51-54).\n Applicant\u2019s debts were charged off in 2008 (exs. 2, 4 and 5).  Applicant\ndocuments payment of his creditor 1.b debt and partial payments of his creditor 1.c debt\n(see exs. B and C; R.T., at 94-100),  but has not addressed his remaining two debts to\ndate (i.e., creditors 1.d and 1.e).  He provides no plan for how he intends to resolve\nthese latter debts (R.T., at 100-101).  \nApplicant currently earns nets about $5,200.00 a month.  After paying his\nmonthly expenses (which includes $1,300.00 a month in child support to W1), he has a\nnet monthly remainder of at least a $1,000.00 a month after payments to identified\ncreditors (R.T., at 103-109).  Applicant could not account for why he is not doing more\nto resolve his remaining non-mortgage debts with his remaining funds (R.T., at 109-\n111).\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in January 2008, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 28, which inquired whether he had incurred any debts over 180 and 90 days\ndelinquent, respectively, during the previous seven years.  He attributed his omissions\nto his uncertainties over whether S ever made any payments on the foreclosed home\n(R.T., at 77-81,113-115).   S had previously told him when she abandoned the home\nthat she could no longer make any payments on the property (R.T., at 79-80).  So, when\nhe completed his e-QIP in January 2008, he had no plausible reason to believe she had\nmade any payments on the mortgage.  Applicant provided no reasons\nApplicant completed his e-QIP in haste and made no attempt to contact S about\nthe status of his home loans, or check on his other delinquent debts (R.T., at 82).  Nor\ndid he inquire of S whether she had made any further payments on the home (R.T., at\n81).  He did indicate he was not thinking about delinquent home loans when he\ncompleted the e-QIP (R.T., at 82-85), but could provide no plausible reasons why he\nbelieved S might have made any further payments on their mortgages, or why he failed\nto list his delinquent mortgage debts and other debts on his e-QIP.  \nIn April 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an agent from the Office of Personnel\nmanagement (OPM).  Applicant recollects his having a credit report with him and asking\nhim questions about his debts (R.T., at 149-150).  He could not recall whether the agent\n\n5\nactually showed him a credit report or otherwise confronted him about his delinquent\ndebts before he disclosed them to the agent (R.T., at 150-153).  \nApplicant provided no endorsements or evidence of his work and status in his\ncommunity.  His testimony did not cover his work or time expended outside of his work\nplace.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG), \u00b6\n18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n6\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts (some mortgage-related and\nothers consumer-related) during periods of financial stress associated with his parting\nways with his girlfriend at the time, and his incurring increased child support obligations.\nWhile he is able to document payment of two of his smaller creditors, he has not been\nable to make any visible headway with most of his major creditors.  Applicant failed to\ndisclose his delinquent debts in the e-QIP he completed in January 2008.   \nFinancial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\n\n7\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of two\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to financial stress associated with his\nparting ways with S with whom he had purchased a home financed with first and second\nmortgages, and in part to increased child support obligations with W1.  Faced with\nmortgage demands and increased child support obligations, Applicant let the  mortgages\non his home become delinquent.  And he failed to address his other listed creditors.  His\nprogress to date in regaining control of his finances remains a  considerable work in\nprogress.  He still has not addressed his major debts and provides no risk-free estimates\nof his ability to resolve a potential deficiency claim by the second mortgagee on his\nforeclosed home or pay off his remaining major creditors. \nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nsome extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations.  As a result,\nMC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019 s circumstances. \nFull mitigation credit is not available to Applicant based on the facts of this case.\nNeither Applicant\u2019s oral or written evidence reflect any initiated voluntary repayment\nefforts in his behalf on his major debts.  His documented payments with two of his\nsmaller creditors, while encouraging, is not enough at this time to warrant full application\nof any of the mitigating conditions covered in the financial guideline.\n                                            \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debt.  He is not able to demonstrate\nenough tangible effort in addressing his covered debts to mitigate a potential deficiency\non his home mortgage, or establish control over his other listed debts. Without more\nevidence of his overall contributions in his work and community, and his progress in\nstabilizing his finances, it is still too soon to credit him with restoring his finances to levels\ncompatible with minimum levels of judgment and trustworthiness. In balance, whole\nperson assessment does not enable Applicant to establish judgment and trust levels\nsufficient to enable him to overcome appraised security concerns arising out his\naccumulation of delinquent debts.\n\n8\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them with,\nand the limited steps he has mounted to address his old debts, it is still too soon to make\nsafe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and restore his\nfinances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d and 1.e.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omission\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s documented omitted tax\nlien in the e-QIP he completed in January 2008.  He denied any intent to falsify his e-QIP\nin his amended answer and affirmatively admitted his having debts over 180 days\ndelinquent when responding to question 28(a) and 28(b) of his e-QIP. His explanations\nare insufficient to avert inferences of knowing and wilful attempts to hide his financial\nproblems. \nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, since he failed to promptly correct his\ninitial e-QIP omissions in the followup-up interview with the OPM agent who interviewed\nhim without the aid prompting.  In the past, the Appeal Board has denied applicants\navailability of the predecessor mitigating condition of MC \u00b6 27(a), \u201c the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts, \u201c where the applicant has waited many months to timely\ncorrect a known omission, and did so only with prompting.  Compare ISCR Case No. 97-\n0289 (Appeal Bd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (Appeal Bd. January\n1995).  \nBy willfully and knowingly failing to disclose his delinquent debts in his e-QIP\napplication, Applicant concealed materially important background information needed for\nthe government to properly process and evaluate his security updates.  His attributed\nreasons for his omitting his arrest/charges (assumptions of S\u2019s making the mortgage\npayments and mental lapse) are not sustainable grounds for averting inferences of\nfalsification.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his e-QIP debt omissions\nand lack of any prompt, good faith corrections, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the necessary\nprobative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he knowingly and deliberately\nwithheld material background information about his debts.\nEvaluation of Applicant on a whole person basis is difficult to do without more\ninformation about his work performance and community endeavors and contributions.\nWhile he appears to be an essentially honest person, he does not provide enough\ninformation to enable him to surmount trust doubts associated with his determined\ndeliberate omissions of his major debts in his e-QIP.\n\n9\nBased on Applicant\u2019s omissions of his major delinquent debts, Applicant is unable\nto successfully refute or mitigate the allegations of deliberate falsification in the SOR.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras.    1.a, 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\n           Sub-paras.\n1.b and 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

He is close to his mother \nand she continues to live in Tunisia. He owns property in Tunisia. He went to Tunisia at \nleast four times in the last three years. Applicant failed to mitigate foreign preference \nand foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 13, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 4). On December 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines \nApril 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and \nB (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn January 15, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (GE 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 27, 2009, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 On April 2, 2009, Applicant provided a response \nto the FORM. The case was assigned to me on April 22, 2009. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel asked me to take administrative notice concerning materials \nrelated to Tunisia (FORM at 3). Department Counsel offered supporting documents to \nshow detail and context for those facts in the administrative notice request (Ex. I to III\u2014\nlisted in FORM at 6).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \n \nApplicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative \nnotice. Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice is granted with respect to \nthe facts in the section labeled \u201cTunisia\u201d on page five of this decision.    \n \n \n \n \n \n1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated March 5, 2009; \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated March 9, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he \nhad 30 days after his receipt to submit information. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nSOR Amendments \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing the letter \ndesignating the pertinent Adjudicative Guideline citation in paragraph 1 from \u201cB\u201d to \u201cC,\u201d \nand to transfer the allegation currently in SOR \u00b6 2.e (stating, \u201cAs of November 5, 2007, \nyou plan to start contributing to the Tunisia system that is similar to the United States \nSocial Security System.\u201d) from underneath the Foreign Influence Guideline to \nunderneath the Foreign Preference Guideline and re-designating it SOR \u00b6 1.e (FORM \nat 10).  Applicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s proposed SOR amendments, \nand they are granted. I changed and initialed and dated the changes on the SOR (GE \n1). \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and \nprovided some explanations. He discussed the reasons why he believes he should have \naccess to classified information. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant was born in Tunisia in 1974.3 He attended college in Tunisia from 1994 \nto 1997, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree. He attended a university in Saudi \nArabia from 1997 to 1998, and then transferred to a U.S. university, which he attended \nfrom 1999 to 2000. He earned a Master of Science degree in 2000. He attended \nanother U.S. university from 2003 to 2007, and earned a Ph.D. in 2007.  \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen on September 15, 2004. He received a U.S. \npassport on September 24, 2004. From August 2007 to the present, he has been \nemployed by a government contractor. He has never married. He has never served in \nthe U.S. military. He has never been charged with any felony, any firearms or \nexplosives offense, or any offense related to alcohol or drugs. He has not been arrested \nor charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type offenses in the last seven years. He \nhas not used any illegal drugs in the last seven years. He has not had any debts \ndelinquent over 180 days, petitioned for bankruptcy, unpaid judgments, or unpaid liens \nin the last seven years. \n \n \n \n \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n3Applicant\u2019s 2007 SF 86 (GE 5) is the source for the facts in this paragraph and the next \nparagraph. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nForeign Influence and Foreign Preference4 \n \nApplicant admits dual citizenship with the United States and Tunisia (SOR \u00b6 1.a; \nGE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 8, 25; GE 5 at 7). Applicant\u2019s Tunisian passport was issued on \nJanuary 7, 2005, and it will not expire until January 6, 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 \nat 25; GE 5 at 8, 20). Applicant used his Tunisian passport to enter and exit Tunisia in \n2005, 2006, and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.c; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 24-25; GE 5 at 8). He continues \nto retain his currently valid Tunisian passport (SOR \u00b6 1.d; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 26; GE 5 \nat 8, 32, 33), even though he has had a U.S. passport since 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; GE 3 at \n3; GE 4 at 7, 8, 25; GE 5 at 20).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Tunisia and she lives in Tunisia (SOR \u00b6 2.a; GE \n4 at 23-24). His father is deceased (GE 4 at 22). Two of his brothers and one sister are \ncitizens of Tunisia and live in Tunisia (SOR \u00b6 2.b; GE 4 at 23-24; GE 5 at 8). Applicant\u2019s \nFORM response emphasized the close relationship he has with his mother, and how \ngrateful he is to his parents for raising him and nurturing him through his formative \nyears. \n \nApplicant went to Tunisia in May 2005, December 2006, July 2006, and July \n2007 to visit his family (SOR \u00b6 2.c; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 24-25; GE 5 at 7). He may have \ntraveled to Tunisia after July 2007 to visit his family (SOR \u00b6 2.c). For the 2005 and \nDecember 2006 visits to Tunisia he stayed for approximately a month, and for the July \n2006 visit to Tunisia, he stayed about three weeks (GE 5 at 7). Applicant owns two \nhomes in Tunisia (one was inherited from his father), and he may at some point start \ncontributing to the Tunisian pension system, which is equivalent to the United States\u2019 \nSocial Security system (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 2.d; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 25; GE 5 at 7-8).  \n \nOn September 24, 2008, Applicant discussed the issue of renunciation of his \nTunisian citizenship and relinquishment of his Tunisian passport as follows: \n \n[I]t is a hard decision to make, especially [because] it involves my country \nof origin, the country where I grew up, where my mother lives, where my \nfamily resides, where I was initiated to [my] education, [and] where I have \ngood memories.  I did mention [to the Office of Personnel Management \ninvestigator] that I did not make that decision yet and I would need to think \nabout it [some] more.  .  .  .  Giving up my Tunisian citizenship is as hard \nas giving up my US citizenship, the citizenship of the country that \nembraced me, provided me with the opportunity to pursue higher \neducation, the country that taught me good values and morals, the country \nthat provided me with the opportunity to work for such big companies and \nwith high caliber people, the country that taught me how to be optimistic \nand hope for [a] better future, and the country that made me who I am. I \nwas really glad that I had the option to keep both citizenships and never \nhad to give up either one.  .  .  .  Now, in [regard to] giving up my Tunisian \n \n4Applicant\u2019s FORM response admitted the facts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.d. He also indicated he has \nnot yet contributed to the Tunisian equivalent of the U.S. Social Security System (SOR \u00b6 1.e).    \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npassport [if that] would result in me being deprived [of] my Tunisian \ncitizenship, then I fall under the previous question regarding giving up my \ncitizenship, which I already answered, otherwise (giving up my Tunisian \npassport would NOT result in me being deprived from my Tunisian \ncitizenship), I do not mind giving it up and I just need to check the details \nof how I can enter Tunisia\u2019s soil without [a] Tunisian passport. \n \n(Emphasis in original) GE 5 at 5. When Applicant responded to the FORM, on April 2, \n2009, he elaborated on his desire to retain his Tunisian passport: \n \nThe concern expressed in this section has to do with the fact that I am \n(retaining) a Tunisian passport. As I mentioned in my response to the \nstatement of reasons, the ONE and ONLY time I need and use my \nTunisian passport is when entering and exiting the Tunisian soil. This is \nconfirmed in the Department of State Counselor Information sheet that Mr. \nL[] presented, which says, \u201cAmerican citizens of Tunisian origin are \nexpected to enter and exit Tunisia on their Tunisian passports. If a \nTunisian American succeeds in entering using a US passport, he or she \nwill still have to present a Tunisian passport to exit the country.\u201d \n  \nTunisia \n \nTunisia is a republic with a president and a single political party.  The diplomatic \nand military relationship between the United States and Tunisia has long been one of \ntrust and mutual support, especially on curbing terrorism and crime. However, Tunisian \ngovernment officials and security forces have occasionally violated the rights of political \nprisoners, and committed other human rights violations. Security forces aggressively \nmonitor and question those suspected of threatening Tunisian security. The relationship \nbetween Tunisia and the United States briefly suffered when Israel acted aggressively \nagainst terrorists in the 1980s and when the United States was engaged in the First Gulf \nwar in 1990. The Department of State notes that Tunisia has \u201copen borders with Libya \nand Algeria\u201d and lists kidnapping of tourists in the last 5-6 years as a concern. The \ncurrent relationship between the United States and Tunisia is described as positive and \nwarm.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s FORM response emphasizes that the Tunisian government is a close \nand stalwart friend of the United States. Applicant and his family have never had a \nproblem with the Tunisian government. There is no evidence that the Tunisian \ngovernment is concerned with Applicant or Applicant\u2019s family. The relationship between \nApplicant and the Tunisian government is one of mutual respect.     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. These conditions state, \u201c10(a) exercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport.\u201d \n \nIn 2005, Applicant applied for and was issued a Tunisian passport after becoming \na U.S. citizen, even though he already had a currently valid U.S. passport. He used the \nTunisian passport to enter and exit Tunisia. He continues to possess a currently valid \nTunisian passport that will continue to be valid until January 2010, establishing AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(1). \u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has raised foreign preference \nsecurity concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate \nmitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.       \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nSecurity officials did not authorize Applicant\u2019s possession or use of a Tunisian \npassport, and he did not invalidate or relinquish his Tunisian passport as described in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and 11(e). His Tunisian passport was not surrendered to his security \nofficer. He obtained and used the Tunisian passport after he became a U.S. citizen.  If \nhe had surrendered his Tunisian passport to his Facility Security Officer, I would have \nmitigated foreign preference security concerns under AG \u00b6 11(e); however, because he \ndid not do so, this security concern is not mitigated.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is mitigated because SOR \u00b6 1.c essentially duplicates SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nexcept Applicant\u2019s possession of a valid U.S. passport and U.S. citizenship are added to \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Actually, his U.S. passport and U.S. citizenship tend to mitigate foreign \npreference concerns, and these connections to the United States do not weigh against \nApplicant\u2019s worthiness to have access to classified information. Thus, I find \u201cFor \nApplicant\u201d on page 13 of his decision.    \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is mitigated because Applicant did not invest in the Tunisian \nequivalent to the U.S. Social Security System. \n \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply and foreign preference security \nconcerns remain because of Applicant\u2019s continued possession of a currently valid \nTunisian passport, despite having ample opportunity to mitigate this concern. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers and one sister, are citizens and residents of \nTunisia. Applicant visited his mother and possibly his Tunisian siblings in 2005, 2006 \nand 2007. The record does not indicate how often he communicates with his family \nliving in Tunisia. There is no evidence that his relatives have connections to the \nTunisian government or military. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person has \nties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members. See ISCR Case No. \n01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).      \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or there is a serious \nproblem in the country with crime or terrorism. Tunisia\u2019s cordial relationship to the \nUnited States, Tunisia\u2019s opposition to terrorists, and the absence of any record that \nTunisia uses espionage to target the United States, place a relatively low burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with family members living \nin Tunisia do not pose a security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and his family living in Tunisia.  \n \nOn the other hand, human rights organizations have criticized the Tunisian \ngovernment\u2019s failure to adhere to human rights standards, and it is conceivable that \nTunisian officials theoretically might target any Tunisian citizen or former Tunisian \ncitizen living in Tunisia or the United States in an attempt to gather valuable information \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfrom the United States, should the relationship between Tunisia and the United States \ndeteriorate, as it has several times in the past. \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his mother, but not his siblings, living in Tunisia create \na potential conflict of interest because his relationship with his mother is sufficiently \nclose to raise a possible security concern about his desire to help his mother, who is \nliving in Tunisia by providing classified, sensitive or protected information. There is \ninsufficient record information about his relationships with his siblings living in Tunisia to \ndetermine there is a foreign influence security concern.    \n \nApplicant owns two houses in Tunisia. These properties are sufficiently \nsubstantial to subject Applicant to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  \nEven after being advised of the security concern raised by ownership of these \nproperties, he did not describe any action to divest himself of these properties.   \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships and \ncontacts with his mother living in Tunisia to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure \nor attempted exploitation. There is some evidence that the Tunisian government might \ncommit human rights violations, and Applicant\u2019s mother living in Tunisia is available \nshould Tunisian officials seek to exploit her to obtain classified, sensitive or protected \ninformation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(e) apply, requiring further review and analysis.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to his mother living in \nTunisia. Applicant has a strong emotional bond with his mother living in Tunisia. \nApplicant emphasizes his close relationship with her in his FORM response, and this \nclose relationship is sufficient to negate these mitigating conditions. Additionally, he was \nreluctant to surrender his Tunisian passport because he wanted it to be available should \nhe need to go to visit his family living in Tunisia. Although Applicant\u2019s close relationships \nwith his mother living in Tunisia is an important positive reflection of his character, this \nsame close relationship raises security concerns for possible foreign influence.       \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s family members living in Tunisia have been \npolitical activists or that they have high profile jobs with the Tunisian government, the \nmilitary or any news media. There is no evidence that terrorists, criminals or the \nTunisian government have approached or threatened Applicant\u2019s family members living \nin Tunisia for any reason. There is no evidence that his family members living in Tunisia \ncurrently engage in activities which would bring attention to them or that the Tunisian \nsecurity forces, terrorists or other anti-U.S. elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with those family members. As such, there is a reduced possibility that \nthese relatives would be targets for coercion or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his relatives in Tunisia, his frequent contacts with \nhis mother, and the potential that the Tunisian government might violate his mother\u2019s \nhuman rights should the relationship between the United States and the Tunisian \ngovernment change and become hostile, all weigh against mitigating security concerns. \nSee ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007) (finding contacts with \nsiblings in PRC \u201conce every two or three  months\u201d not to be casual and infrequent); \nISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with \napplicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per year not casual and \ninfrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts \nwith applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and infrequent).     \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to the United States have developed over the last 10 \nyears. Because they are more recent, they tend to be more important than his \nconnections over more than 25 years to Tunisia. His U.S. connections tend to mitigate \nforeign interest security concerns. He has many friends and colleagues in the United \nStates. He is a loyal, dedicated U.S. citizen. He swore an oath of allegiance to the \nUnited States when he became a U.S. citizen. He has a Ph.D. and is likely to make \nsignificant contributions to national security and his company in the future. All these \ncircumstances provide some support for a conclusion that Applicant will recognize, \nresist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group at \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ncoercion or exploitation. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is partially established and tends to \npartially, but not fully, mitigate foreign influence security concerns. There is sufficient \nlingering foreign influence security concern to find \u201cAgainst Applicant\u201d in the Formal \nFindings of this decision on page 13. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I hereby incorporate all of my comments \nunder the preceding discussions of the four pertinent adjudicative guidelines into this \nsection.  \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate security concerns under the whole \nperson concept. He has somewhat greater connections to the United States than to \nTunisia. He moved to the United States ten years ago, and he became a U.S. citizen in \n2004. He swore an oath of allegiance to the United States. His dedication to his work \nand to the United States is a very positive indication of his good character and \ntrustworthiness. He is loyal to the United States. Applicant\u2019s record of good \nemployment, the absence of derogatory information concerning financial problems and \nsubstance abuse and his law-abiding character weigh in his favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation, or criminal activity.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines is not sufficient to warrant access to classified information. The foreign \npreference security concern is substantial. After becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant \nobtained a Tunisian passport. He used his Tunisian passport for his 2005 and 2006 \nvisits to Tunisia. He did not relinquish or surrender his Tunisian passport to his facility \nsecurity official (FSO). He has two properties in Tunisia. He was informed of the security \nconcerns raised by the Tunisian properties and he did not relinquish his interest in them. \nHe has a very close relationship with his mother. Tunisian government officials might \nviolate her human rights to put pressure on her to obtain classified, protected or \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsensitive information. Terrorists might enter Tunisia and put pressure on his mother to \nobtain such information.      \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nforeign preference and foreign influence security concerns.      \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On September 11, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 2, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 17, 2009.

Applicant also has a 19-year-old son from a previous relationship. (GE 1, \nTr. 16-20.) Applicant\u2019s wife is employed full-time as a cage shift supervisor at a local \ncasino. (Tr. 79-80.) \n \nApplicant served in the Marine Corps from October 1988 to October 1992, and \nwas honorably discharged as a lance corporal (pay grade E-3).

(GE 1, Tr. 14-15, 20-22, 66.) \n \nThe SOR alleges four arrests or citations and four periods of employment that \nended under less than favorable conditions. Summarized, they are: \n \nIn December 1998, while employed as a dispatcher for the local sheriff\u2019s \ndepartment, Applicant was arrested for felony computer tampering and felony criminal \nhistory records, unauthorized disclosure. This arrest involved work-related misconduct. \nHe testified, \u201cActually, I believe the second charge ended up being a misdemeanor and \nI plead guilty to a Class 6 undesignated felony and a Class 1 misdemeanor is what I \nwas convicted of.\u201d He was sentenced to three months in jail and placed on three months \nprobation. He served 45 days in jail under a work release program. Applicant testified \nthat he was helping out an acquaintance and added that he knew it was a violation of \npolicy, but thought it was a \u201cminor violation.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Following this arrest, he was \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nplaced on administrative leave and subsequently resigned from his position. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a.) (GE 2, Tr. 23-32.) \n \nIn June 2001, while employed as a circulation assistant for local newspaper, \nApplicant was terminated after he was involved in an accident while driving a company \nvehicle. He described the accident, \u201cAnd as I backed around to make my turn, I \nsmashed into the back end of the vehicle. You know, the company was responsible to \npay for it. So, in turn, they terminated me. I had been there, you know, less than a year, \nso I think that\u2019s probably why. I hadn\u2019t been there, you know, that long.\u201d When queried \nby Department Counsel, Applicant conceded that he had been reported for speeding \nwhile driving a company vehicle. (GE 2, Tr. 32-34, 74-75.) (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \n \nIn February 2001, Applicant was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife \nwhich led to his being arrested and charged with disorderly conduct-fighting. He testified \nthat he broke a chair and \u201cdidn\u2019t really know it was against the law to break my own \nproperty, but apparently it is when you\u2019re involved in a domestic.\u201d Pursuant to his guilty \npleas, he was convicted and sentenced to ten days in jail (suspended), ordered to \ncomplete anger management classes, and placed on three months probation. (GE 2, Tr. \n34-37.) (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) \n \nIn May 2002, Applicant was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife and \nmother-in-law, which led to his being arrested and charged with assault. He testified, \n\u201c[m]y mother-in-law came out and struck me and \u2013 and in self \u2013 I was defending \u2013 trying \nto defend myself from my mother-in-law and the wife scratched my face and so I \ngrabbed her by the neck to hold her back. I was arrested. We were all three convicted of \nmisdemeanor assault.\u201d Pursuant to his guilty plea, he was convicted and sentenced to \none day in jail, ordered to complete anger management classes, and placed on one \nyear of probation. (GE 2, Tr. 38-45.) (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) \n \nIn May 2002, while employed as a route relief driver for a local linen company, \nApplicant was fired for not showing up for work. He testified that he was unable to report \nfor work because he was incarcerated following his assault arrest, discussed supra. (GE \n2, Tr. 37-38, 75.) (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) \n \nIn April 2006, while employed as communications manager for the local fire \ndepartment, Applicant was terminated for harassment. Applicant testified that he was \nunfairly terminated for purportedly sending inappropriate text messages and e-mails to a \nfemale co-worker. Referring to how he was treated by his employer during his \ntermination, Applicant testified, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really given a fair chance to say anything. I said \n\u2013 and I even told him, well, you\u2019ve already made your decision apparently because \nyou\u2019re not giving me a chance to speak, so I have nothing to say. And I was \ndisrespected by the Human Resources Officer. I was called some disrespectful names \nand so it led to the entire thing just being, you know, you need to leave.\u201d (GE 2, Tr. 46-\n54, 82-83.) (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant was cited for endanger life/health of minor. He had \nleft his four and a-half-year-old son alone while he drove his youngest daughter to \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nschool. A neighbor called the police after observing Applicant\u2019s 4\u00bd year old son \nwandering away from home. Applicant was fined \u201caround $200\u201d and the charge was \ndismissed. He acknowledged using poor judgment. (GE 2, Tr. 54-58.) \n \nWhen asked by Department Counsel what changes he made to prevent future \narrests or terminations, Applicant answered: \n \nSome of the things happened when I was a little younger. The Sheriff\u2019s \nDepartment, I was a lot younger, you know, 11 years ago I was arrested \nfor that, in \u201998, you know. I\u2019m a lot older now. I\u2019m more mature. Try to \nmake better decisions. You know, sometimes you\u2019re gonna make a bad \ndecision. I try not to. You know, I try to make better judgment calls. I try \nnot to \u2013 you know, I try to follow the rules at work, you know. Like I said, \nI\u2019ve been there two years. I\u2019ve had no problems, you know. I\u2019m obviously \nstill there. \n \nYou know, and regardless of the results, I\u2019m still gonna be there. They \u2013 \nyou know, they advised they will keep me, you know, so I \u2013 I\u2019ve grown up. \nI\u2019m trying to, you know, get where I see that \u2013 I\u2019m 38. In about ten or 15 \nyears, I gotta start thinking about retirement. So, you know, I don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t \n\u2013 I don\u2019t have time to be bouncing around and going from job to job or \ndoing this and that. I just \u2013 I gotta focus on getting to where I need to be \nwhen I\u2019m, you know, a little older and time to settle down, you know. (Tr. \n58-59.) \n \nApplicant and his wife were recently given power-of-attorney to care for their 17-\nyear-old son\u2019s 16-year-old girlfriend. She lives with Applicant\u2019s family and is pregnant. \nApplicant anticipates he will help support his son\u2019s girlfriend and child. (Tr. 64-66.) \nApplicant did not submit any references or performance evaluations. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 15, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 sets out two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \n \nThe Government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \npresented that he had four arrests or citations from 1998 to 2007, spanning a nine-year \nperiod. His most recent citation occurred one year before submitting his e-QIP. His \narrests or citations include felony computer tampering, felony historical records \u2013 \nunauthorized disclosure, disorderly conduct-fighting, assault, and endanger life/health of \nminor.  \n \nAdditionally, the Government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nevidence presented that he left four separate jobs under adverse conditions during the \nsame nine-year period. The foregoing warrants application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d). \n \nPotential mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nNone of the potential mitigating conditions under this concern are applicable. \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent and not \nisolated. Considering his behavior, the nature and seriousness of his misconduct, his \nexercise of repeated poor judgment culminating in his recent citation for endangering \nthe life/health of a minor as recent as one year before submitting his e-QIP, and other \nfactors identified supra, I find his favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate \nGuideline E security concerns. His conduct raises questions about his ability and \nwillingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information. His \nconduct also raises serious doubts and questions about his judgment. Further time and \nadditional evidence is needed before I can overcome my concerns/doubts regarding \nApplicant\u2019s questionable judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nrefute personal conduct security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the \nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support \na favorable decision. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.h.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant owed approximately $18,000 on three judgments and eleven accounts \ncharged off or placed-for-collection. Applicant has paid, is paying, or has arranged \npayment on his debts. Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security \nconcerns under financial considerations. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n1 \nSeptember 2, 2009\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on March 11, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn April 6, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nJune 16, 2009, I was assigned the case. On July 7, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing which was held on August 3, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 12, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through Q, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On August 3, 2009, additional material was submitted. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the \nrecord as Ex. R. On August 7, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l. He admitted the remaining factual allegations. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are accepted as fact. After a thorough review of the \nrecord, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior security engineer, who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since February 2007. (Tr. 38) He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. In 2006, in a prior job, Applicant received a certificate of recognition for his \noutstanding work performance. (Ex. N) Two supervisors who knew him in 2006 stated \nApplicant demonstrated professionalism, technical excellence, forward thinking, \nprogressive management capabilities, that he provided top-notch customer service, and \nprovided outstanding performance. (Ex. O, Q) Another supervisor stated Applicant had \noutstanding character and duty performance. (Ex. P)  \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant\u2019s gross monthly salary was $7,000 and his net income \nwas $4,900. (Ex.2) In February 2008, Applicant obtained financial counseling from a \nfriend who was a mortgage broker. (Tr. 67) Applicant was told to contact his creditors \nand have them correct any inaccurate information. (Ex. 2) In November 2008, when he \nanswered written interrogatories, Applicant stated his net monthly income was $2,170 \nand he was working diligently to clear up his debts. (Tr. 65, Ex. 3, p 20) His current \nyearly income is approximately $98,000. (Tr. 76) In December 2009, he plans to marry. \nHis fianc\u00e9\u2019s yearly income is $70,000 and she is debt free. (Tr. 77)  \n \n \nPrior to 2003, Applicant asserts his credit was outstanding. (Tr. 36, Ex. 3, p 20) \nThat year his mother experienced financial hardships and Applicant began to provide \nher support. (Tr. 36)  While employed, her employer paid her insurance. Once retired, \nhis mother had to pay the cost of her own health insurance, which was more than $500 \nper month. (Tr. 64) She was unable to handle paying her insurance payments, \nmortgage payments, and utility bills. Applicant assisted her by sending her $500 to $700 \n2 \n\nper month. (Tr. 65) His mother\u2019s home is now paid off and his mother is in a better \nfinancial position. (Tr. 63) He no longer provides her support.  \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant was interviewed about his finances. (Ex. 2) At that \ntime, he stated he did not recognize either of the judgments listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. and 1.b \n($3,071 and $2,896). In June 2004, a $2,795 civil suit was filed against Applicant as to \nthe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($3,071). (Ex. 8) Following the hearing, Applicant arranged \na $180 per month automatic withdrawal to pay this debt. \n \n \nIn August 2003, the creditor filed for a $3,057 judgment and in October 2003, \nfiled for a $2,896 judgment. (Ex. 6) This relates to the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nApplicant makes $434.50 monthly payments on this debt. (Tr. 44, 67, Ex. F, G) \n \n \nApplicant owed a telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.j, $648) being collected by a \ncollection service. The account has been paid. (Tr. 55, Ex. H, I)  Applicant disputed a \n$186 telephone service debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). The telephone company was supposed to \nsend him equipment. When it never arrived, Applicant called the telephone company \nagain and the equipment was sent. However, he was double billed for the equipment. \n(Tr. 51) Applicant\u2019s telephone service is with this creditor and his account has a zero \nbalance. (Ex. R 1, R 3) \n \n \nApplicant obtained a student loan to pay tuition on a $3,000 Microsoft course. \n(Tr. 53) The Sallie Mae account (SOR \u00b6 1.i, $5,891) went delinquent in late 2002. The \nsuccessor-in-interest, a collection agency (SOR \u00b6 1.k), obtained a $3,903 judgment in \nApril 2003. (Ex. 4) In September 2005, the collection agency obtained a second \njudgment ($4,323). (Ex. 5) Starting in May 2009, Applicant has been making $600 \nmonthly payments on this debt (Tr. 53, Ex. B, C) The amounts owed in Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 2007 credit bureau report (CBR) list the same amount of high credit for the \nSallie Mae account and for the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.k. (Ex. 9, p. 7) This collection \nagency also lists itself as a Sallie Mae corporation. Applicant is currently making \npayments to a successor-in-interest, another collection agency. Applicant spoke with \nSallie Mae and confirmed there was only one student loan. (Tr. 54) \n \n \nIn February 2001, Applicant opened an account with a $500 limit to buy clothing. \nThe account (SOR \u00b6 1.n, $851) went delinquent in 2002. This debt was settled for $425. \n(Ex. 3, p 21, Ex. L) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied owing the $210 debt \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.l., because he said he had paid it long ago. Applicant provided proof \nthis debt has been paid. (R-8, R-9) \n \n \nApplicant has one daughter, age 11, who lives with him. (Tr. 41) Applicant \nasserts his finances will not be a problem in the future. He manages his finances more \nmethodically. (Tr. 78)  He has only one credit card. (Tr. 78) Creditors are not calling him \nor mailing him concerning past due obligations. He is current on his car loan, utility bills, \nand other obligations.

L) \n \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n$23,196 \n \n4 \n\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n5 \n\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant had three unpaid judgments and nine charged off or placed-for-\ncollection accounts, which total approximately $18,000. The debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b \n($2,896) and SOR \u00b6 1.n ($851) are the same obligation and the student loan listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($5,891) and the judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($4,137), are the same \nobligation. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n6 \n\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n The mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(a) only partially apply because the debts were \nrecent and numerous. However, Applicant has paid or is paying his obligations. Under \nthe circumstances, it is unlikely Applicant\u2019s financial problems will recur. Applicant was \nhelping his mother when she first retired. His mother no longer requires his assistance.  \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(b) have limited applicability. Applicant incurred \nunanticipated expenses of assisting his mother following her retirement. It was \nunexpected that he would have to do so. However, this was not a condition that was \nlargely beyond his control. It was his choice to assist her, which led to his financial \nproblems. \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(c) apply. Applicant sought financial counseling \nand his financial problems are under control. He maintains a single credit card, is not \nreceiving calls or mail from creditors demanding payment, and is paying his debts as \nagreed. Applicant is making payments on the judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b and student \nloan listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i, which shows a good-faith effort to repay debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies. \n \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant arranged to make $180 monthly payments on \nthe judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($3,071) by automatic withdrawal. He also agreed to \nmake $110 monthly payments on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($851). Normally, \narrangements to start making payments following the hearing are of little weight \nbecause it is often difficult to ascertain if the repayment schedule will be met. However, \nin this case, Applicant shows a pattern of making automatic withdrawals from his \nchecking account on a monthly basis to pay his debts. It is this pattern of payment \nwhich makes it likely he will continue making his monthly payments.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntypes that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Applicant chose to assist his mother during her financial time of need. \nShe no longer needs his financial support. At one point, Applicant\u2019s finances were out of \ncontrol and he was unable to pay his obligations in a timely manner. He is now in \ncontrol of his finances and is making timely payment on his debts. He makes \napproximately $98,000 a year. He has paid, is paying, or will shortly start paying on all \nthe SOR debts. Applicant is living within his means and paying his obligations in a \ntimely manner.  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid\u2014it is whether his \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \n(See AG & 2(a)(1)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.n: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n9 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n__________________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on May 5, 2009, Applicant admitted all four of the\nallegations set forth in the SOR and declined a hearing on the record. Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), dated August 10, 2009.\nApplicant received the FORM on August 17, 2009, but declined to file a response to its\ncontents. On October 8, 2009, the Director, DOHA, forwarded the case for assignment\nto an administrative judge. I was assigned the case that day. Based on a review of the\nOctober 30, 2009\n\n SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d.\n      1\n Response to the SOR at 3.\n      2\n Id.\n      3\n SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a.\n      4\n Response to the SOR at 2.\n      5\n2\ncase file, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding\nthe security concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old production manager who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since October 1998. He has served in his present capacity since\nApril 2004. According to his SF-86, Applicant served in the military reserve for\napproximately four years. He married in 1990 and has two minor children. He attended\ncollege for about three years. In choosing an administrative determination without a\nhearing, Applicant chose to rely on the written record. Because his submissions are\nbrief, the facts of record are scant. Consequently, these findings are based on materials\nincluded in the FORM. \nAt some unspecified time in the recent past, however, Applicant purchased a\nused car hauler with the hopes of establishing a car towing business. The truck needed\napproximately $30,000 in repairs. Additional revenue was lost as repairs were made.\nHe abandoned the enterprise when he could no longer afford the business-related\nexpenses. \nApplicant has two mortgages on his home for approximately $109,000 and\n$437,000, respectively. They amount to a total of approximately $546,000.  He fell\n1\nbehind on his home loans when the hauling business failed. A loan for about $109,000\nwas written off by the lender. Applicant intends to repay the $109,000 loan \u201cas our\nincome allows.\u201d  The latter loan for approximately $437,000 was restructured under a\n2\nrepayment plan with more affordable terms.  Applicant did not submit documentation\n3\nregarding his income history, the repayment plan, or any payments under that plan.\nIn addition, Applicant also financed two investment properties in 2007. Those\nproperties went into foreclosure. The first property left him indebted on a loan for about\n$385,000.  Regarding this debt, he states: \u201cIt is my desire to start a repayment plan that\n4\nwill fit within our budget, as our income increases.\u201d  He did not submit any documents\n5\nreflecting his present income or financial resources, his wife\u2019s most recent income, or a\ncurrent budget. The loan on the second investment property was for approximately\n\n SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b. Applicant admitted to a debt of $264,308, although the FORM notes that the\n      6\nobligation alleged, after foreclosure, was reduced through a deficiency judgment to only $94,000.

Applicant states: \u201cWe are currently making a small monthly payment to a\n6\nthird party collector. . . .\u201d  He did not submit any documentation regarding such\n7\npayments.\nApplicant admits responsibility for all four debts at issue. He stresses that his\ncurrent financial difficulty arises from his attempts to \u201cbuild for the future,\u201d not from\n\u201cliving above one\u2019s means.\u201d  Neither he nor his wife gambles, uses drugs, or is the type\n8\nto engage in criminal activity. His family leads a disciplined, healthy lifestyle. He drives\n\u201cthe same car [he] paid $800 dollars for, three years ago.\u201d  He has no credit card debt\n9\nor revolving credit. Their vacation travel is limited: \u201cWe just don\u2019t finance trips, so we\ndon\u2019t take them if we can\u2019t pay for them.\u201d  But for his real estate debts, he states that\n10\nhe lives within his means, although no documentation was introduced indicating what\nhis income and expenses are.\nApplicant unsuccessfully attempted to solicit investors and to execute short-sales\nto avoid the foreclosures at issue. He was advised to consider bankruptcy, but would\nrather address his debts through \u201chard work and persistence.\u201d  His wife was laid off,\n11\nbut is now seeking a position requiring a security clearance. Applicant assumes she will\nalso face financial security concerns.\u201d  If so, he is unsure they will be able to repay\n12\ntheir loans.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they\nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      14\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      15\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      16\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      17\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      18\n Id.\n      19\n4\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government (Government) must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for\npresenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is\n14\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion\n15\nis on the applicant.  \n16\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security\n17\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any\n18\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to\n19\ndeny an individual a security clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an\napplicant\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      20\n5\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a\nclearance.\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) is the most pertinent to the case.\nApplicable conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under\n20\nthis guideline. Applicant admitted he has over $1,000,000 in real estate-related debt.\nSuch delinquent debt is sufficient to raise security concerns under financial\nconsiderations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).\nConsequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case against him and\nmitigate security concerns. \nApplicant tried to start a sideline business in automobile hauling, but\napproximately $30,000 in repairs and business disruptions forced him to abandon the\nbusiness. Trying to sustain that business affected his ability to make timely payments\non, at least, his $546,000 in mortgages on his personal residence. To the extent the\nfailing business affected the family\u2019s ability to make timely mortgage payments,\nfinancial considerations mitigating condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) apply. \nApplicant was advised by someone to consider bankruptcy, but there is no\nevidence he received financial counseling. There is no documentation of progress in\npaying his debts. Therefore, neither FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control\u201d) nor FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) applies. No\nother FC MCs apply.\n\n Indeed, the $30,000 car hauling business loss, without more evidence, appears to be a relatively minor\n      21\nfinancial setback in contrast to real estate obligations exceeding $1,000,000.\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Multiple facts speak in Applicant\u2019s favor. He is a mature man who has raised a\nfamily and been with the same employer for over a decade. He served in the United\nStates military. He and his wife attempted to establish a sideline business and\npurchased investment properties in the hopes of building for their future.\nMultiple facts also speak against Applicant. He provided no documentation\nregarding his efforts to address any of the debts at issue, nor did he provide any\nevidence regarding his income, his wife\u2019s former income, his financial resources, or a\nbudget. Consequently, whether he has been living within his means cannot be\nconfirmed. Such information is particularly important given his financial caution\nregarding his car and vacation plans versus his approximately $550,000 in residential\nhome loans. Further, while his inability to find investors or short-sell his investment\nproperties could be blamed on the current recession, it is unclear as to how he ever\nmade timely payments on the additional $500,000 in obligations generated by his\nownership of those properties.  In choosing an administrative determination, Applicant\n21\nfailed to offer sufficient documentation regarding his efforts to address his debts. He\nalso failed to offer evidence as to the financial context in which his debts and his efforts\ncould be considered. The burden in these proceedings is on the applicant. Based on\nthe unelaborated record, financial considerations security concerns remain. Therefore, I\n\n7\nconclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

Halpern, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant successfully mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted. \n \nOn May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nDOHA amended the SOR on August 2, 2009. Applicant answered the SOR in \nwriting on July 15, 2009, and the amended SOR on August 11, 2009. He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 5, \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 11, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 24, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 \nand Hearing Exhibit (HE) I for demonstrative purposes. Applicant did not object and \nthey were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through F, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record was held open until October 8, 2009, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documents, which he did. They were marked AE G \nthrough L. The government had no objections, the documents were admitted, and the \nrecord closed.1 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 1, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except 1.d and 1.e. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 66 years old and has been working for 40 years. He presently works \nfor a federal contactor as a senior scientist. His past experience is as an aerospace \nengineer. His past employment history includes working for a large company for 19 \nyears and with other companies in his area of expertise. He is married and has three \ngrown daughters, one of whom lives with him, with her two children.2  \n \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s employer sold the division of the company he was working \nwith to another company. Applicant received a severance package in the amount of \napproximately $60,000. He was unemployed for a few months before finding another \njob. In 2002, Applicant was working for a company on a project that ended. The \ncompany reduced its work force and he was laid off. Prior to 2002, Applicant was \ncurrent on all of his bills. He and a colleague decided to start their own business. They \nused their savings and while the business was starting they did not earn an income. \nThey were confident that the business would be successful and had promises of \ngovernment contracts. During this time, Applicant stated that the Defense Department \nwas shifting its resources from research and development, which his business was \nfocused on, to the wars that were being waged. Despite promises and then apologies \nfrom their potential customers, they did not receive contracts. Applicant had used up his \nsavings and was using credit cards to pay his living expenses and business expenses. \nIn 2004, they concluded the business had failed, and in May 2004, he found a job.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s new job with Company X was located more than 100 miles away from \nhis home. He commuted to his place of employment daily and his income was \napproximately $82,000. Due to the lengthy commute and the exhausting toll it took on \nhim, he resigned and took a different job in May 2005. His salary increased to $90,000. \nHe was laid off from this job in May 2007. His delinquent debts increased during this \n \n1 Department Counsel response was marked as HE II. \n \n2 Tr. 22-25, 67-74. \n \n3 Tr. 27-33, 62-64,106-107. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nperiod. He was unemployed until October 2007, when he was hired by his current \nemployer. His salary is $92,000.4 \n \nIn 2008, Applicant became eligible to collect his pension. He began receiving \n$1,935 monthly from his pension from the company where he worked for 19 years. In \nJune 2009, he began receiving $1,700 from social security benefits.5 \n \n \nAfter his business failed, he had incurred approximately $30,000 to $40,000 in \ndelinquent debt. He stated he could not pay down the debt while working for Company \nX. He continued to pay two credit cards through 2005. He had approximately $124 \nremaining from his salary at the end of each month, after paying his living expenses. \nEach subsequent year, his salary increased slightly, but not enough to begin paying \nback his debt. He stayed current on his mortgage and other living expenses. In 2008, \nwhen Applicant\u2019s salary increased and he began receiving both his pension and social \nsecurity benefits, he had significant expendable income to begin repaying his creditors, \nwhich he did.6 \n \n \nIn January and February 2008, Applicant paid off two credit cards that had not \nbeen delinquent, but had balances. He had made payments on these cards regularly \nand retired the balances.7 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.a ($6,196) is a credit card debt. Applicant settled the debt. He \nmade two payment of $3,000. He made a final payment that was received on \nSeptember 28, 2009. The debt has been settled and paid.8  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.b ($13,874) is a credit card debt. Applicant settled the debt in \nFebruary 2009, and received a confirmation of the settlement on September 14, 2009.9  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.c ($12,223) is a credit card debt. Applicant had difficulty \ntracking down the current collection company on this debt. He made arrangements to \nsettle the debt with two payments of $3,934 to be paid on September 23, 2009, and a \nsecond payment of $1,934 to be paid on October 31, 2009. When he makes the final \npayment the debt will be settled.10  \n \n4 Tr. 24-25, 33-36. \n \n5 Tr. 25-27. \n \n6 Tr. 37-44, 81; AE B. \n \n7 AE C. \n \n8 Tr. 45-49; AE C at 7, H. \n \n9 Tr. 49-52; AE C at 4. \n \n10 Tr. 52-56, 88; AE C at 2, G. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.d was a tax lien from 1993. When Applicant changed jobs, \nthere were disputed issues regarding travel payments and a severance package and \ntheir tax consequences. He disputed the issues with the Internal Revenue Service and \nthe matter was resolved in 1995. Department Counsel conceded this lien was \nreleased.11 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.e ($35) is a medical debt that is no longer on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report. He disputed this debt with his medical insurance provider because he \nbelieved they were responsible for paying it. He wrote the creditor and advised them it \nwas the insurance company\u2019s responsibility. The creditor sent the debt to collection. \nAlthough Applicant disputed owing the debt, he paid it in order to resolve the issue.12 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.f ($168) is a debt to a telephone company. Applicant disputed \nthis debt with the creditor. He requested the phone service be discontinued, and the \ncompany continued to bill him. Even though he disputed the debt, he settled the debt so \nit would be resolved.13 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.g ($1,320) was a homeowner assessment for his house. He \nstopped paying this bill in 2004. The creditor obtained a judgment. Applicant paid the \njudgment.14  \n \n \nApplicant admitted to paying some of his bill late in the last year. He stated he \nwas no more than 30 days late. He also had a dispute with his mortgage company \nregarding insurance. He admitted he did not have insurance on his home for two \nmonths due to an oversight. He has resolved the issues with his insurance company \nand is current on his bills. He has not received any financial counseling. Applicant \npresently has sufficient income to pay all of his monthly expenses and other debts.15 \n \n \nApplicant provided nine character letters.16 In the letters, he is described as \ntrustworthy and ethical, with the highest level of integrity and professionalism. He is \ncharacterized as an expert in his field, who is reliable, disciplined and self-motivated. He \nis recommended for a security clearance.17 \n \n \n \n11 Tr. 15-17, 56-58; GE 6 and 7; AE C at 12. \n \n12 Tr. 58-59, 82-83; AE C at 11. \n \n13 Tr. 59-60, 82-83; AE C at 8-9, I. \n \n14 Tr. 60-62, 81-82, 103; AE C at 13, J. \n \n15 Tr. 90-105, 111-114. \n \n16 AE F. \n \n17 Id. Tr. 65-66. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts after experiencing a failed business \nventure in 2002. Many of his debts remained delinquent for several years. I find there is \nsufficient evidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant paid all of the debts alleged in the SOR. He experienced financial \nproblems when he and his business partner started a new business and it failed. They \nwere confident they would receive government contracts, but due to the changing needs \nof the Defense Department, the contracts never materialized. Applicant invested his \npersonal savings into the business. When it failed he used credit cards to pay for his \nneeds. I find that the conditions that resulted in his financial problems were beyond his \ncontrol. He stayed current on some of his bills and others became delinquent. When he \nbegan receiving his pension, he systematically resolved his delinquent debts. Applicant \nnow earns a sufficient income that is enhanced by his pension and social security \nbenefits. The circumstances that caused his financial hardship are unlikely to recur and \nApplicant acted responsibly when his employment situation changed. I find mitigating \nconditions (a) and (b) apply. Applicant has resolved his delinquent debts, he is earning \nsufficient income to pay his bills, and his finances are under control. He has paid all of \nhis creditors and is living within his means. He disputed some debts, but decided to pay \nthem to resolve the issues. I find mitigating conditions (c), (d) and (e) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant experienced financial \nproblems when he started a business that failed due to issues beyond his control. He \nlost his savings and used credit cards so he could live. Once he began working again \nand earning a salary, he systematically paid his delinquent debts. He now has sufficient \n\n \n8 \n \n \nincome and lives within his means. Overall, the record evidence does not leave me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nthe guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national interests to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He attended college from 1971 to 1972, but did not complete a degree. He \nserved honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1984 to 1988, as a disbursing clerk. Applicant \nmarried his first wife in 1978 and they were divorced in 1981. He married his second \nwife in 1984 and they were divorced in 1999. He has two children of this relationship, a \n25-year-old daughter and a son, age 19. He provides some financial assistance for his \ndaughter and he is paying $250 monthly (by garnishment of pay) in child support for his \nson. \n \nApplicant has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since \nOctober 1997. Under the sponsorship of his employer, Applicant has possessed a \nsecurity clearance at the secret level for approximately 12 years. There is no evidence \nhe has ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. At his \nhearing, Applicant presented the testimony of his direct supervisor. Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisors and co-workers consider him to have an outstanding reputation and an \nimpeccable work ethic. He is considered to be a patriotic American, trustworthy, and \ndedicated to his work and accomplishing his mission.  \n \nApplicant has kept his supervisors and parents informed of his financial \nproblems. His supervisor believes Applicant is doing all he can under the circumstances \nto resolve his financial problems. Applicant consistently volunteers to work overtime and \nduring holidays to earn extra income to pay his debts. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn his January 2008 security clearance application, Applicant indicated that he \nhad no debts that were over 180 days delinquent within the last seven years and/or 90 \ndays delinquent at the time he completed his application. He also indicated that in the \nlast seven years he had not been a party to any public record civil court action, and had \nno unpaid judgments. His background investigation addressed his financial status and \nincluded the review of February 2008, August 2008, and February 2009 credit bureau \nreports (CBRs), numerous state court documents, and Applicant\u2019s security clearance \napplication.  \n \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent accounts, two of which are judgments, totaling \napproximately $27,000. All of his debts have been delinquent since 1999. He explained \nthat the three debts were his ex-wife\u2019s personal debts, which she acquired without his \nknowledge. When he divorced his wife in 1999, he was awarded the three debts as part \nof the marital property settlement agreement.  \n \nApplicant testified he tried to pay the debts, but did not have the financial means \nto do so. His income was not sufficient to cover the debts and his day-to-day living \nexpenses. In 2000, he tried to resolve the debts by filing for bankruptcy protection. He \nhired an attorney and completed some preliminary bankruptcy filings; however, he did \nnot have the money to pay his attorney to complete the process. In 2001-2002, he \nunderwent credit counseling and made some monthly payments pursuant to a debt \nconsolidation agreement. However, he stopped making payments because, again, he \nlacked the financial means. Shortly thereafter, Applicant moved residences and lost \ncontact with his creditors. Since then, Applicant has made no further effort to pay, settle, \nor resolve the three delinquent debts until 2008. In December 2008, Applicant contacted \nthe creditor of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and was offered a structured settlement. \nHe declined the settlement offer because he could not afford the monthly payments.  \n \nIn September 2009, Applicant retained the services of an attorney to help him \nresolve the three delinquent debts and to stop his son\u2019s child support payments. \nApplicant seeks to stop the $250 child support garnishment of pay because his son is \nalmost 20 years old. Applicant has asked his attorney to research his debts to \ndetermine the proper creditors and determine whether he is financially liable for the \ndebts since some are too old. Applicant also has asked his parents for financial \nassistance. His mother promised to lend Applicant the money to pay off his creditors.   \n \nApplicant earns approximately $38,000 a year. His take home pay is \napproximately $1,400 a month. In August 2009, he started receiving a $269 pension, \nwhich he will receive until he is paid a total of $26,000. His monthly expenses include \n$750 rent and an average of $600 in food expenses. Prior to receiving the $269 \npension, Applicant had only $50 of disposable income at the end of the month. He \nstruggled financially, but his parents provided him with financial assistance whenever he \nneeded it. In 2004, Applicant underwent vocal cord cancer surgery. Because he does \nnot have insurance coverage, he has had to pay for his medications out of pocket. A \nreview of Applicant\u2019s CBRs shows he seems to be living within his financial means.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d1 Once the \ngovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \n \n1  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent debts, including two judgments and one \ncollection, which have been delinquent since approximately 1999. These are Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts as established by the admitted CBRs and his testimony at the hearing.  \n \nThe delinquent debts were his ex-wife\u2019s accounts which were awarded to \nApplicant in 1998-1999, as part of the marital property settlement agreement. Initially, \nApplicant attempted to resolve the debts through bankruptcy proceedings and credit \nconsolidation but both failed. After 2001-2002, Applicant made no further effort to \nresolve his financial obligations until 2008. Based on Applicant\u2019s testimony, he is \nstruggling financially and does not have the financial means to pay his legal obligations, \ndelinquent debts, and his day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond his control, which contributed to his \ninability to pay his debts, i.e., his divorce and his limited earnings. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies, but does not fully mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s evidence \nis not sufficient to show he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He presented no \nevidence of debt payments, contacts with creditors, and settlement or negotiations to \nresolve his SOR debts after 2002 until he received his SOR in 2008. Considering the \nevidence as a whole, Applicant is struggling financially and his financial problems are \nnot under control. Applicant does not seem to have the financial means to resolve his \nfinancial predicament or to avoid similar financial problems in the future. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), (d), and (e) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not yet under control. He did show some effort to resolve his debts. However, his \nactions are not sufficient to fully raise the mitigating conditions. AG \u00b6 20(f) is not \nrelevant to this facts.  \n \n \nDespite partial applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), financial considerations concerns are \nnot mitigated. Applicant has not demonstrated his financial responsibility by taking \nsufficient actions to resolve his debts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man and an \noutstanding worker. He is a patriotic, law abiding American, and a proud U.S. Navy \nveteran. He has worked well for government contractors and has held access to \nclassified information for approximately 12 years. There is no evidence he has ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information. Applicant \nestablished some circumstances beyond his control, which contributed to his inability to \npay his debts. These factors show some responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \n \nNonetheless, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to fully mitigate the financial \nconsiderations concerns. He has limited earnings and seems to be struggling \nfinancially. He presented little documentary evidence of debt payments, contacts with \ncreditors, and settlement or negotiations of debts from the time he acquired the debts in \n1999 to 2008 when he received the SOR. His favorable information fails to show \nfinancial responsibility and good judgment or that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. His financial problems are not under control. He does not have a viable \nplan to avoid similar financial problems in the future.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana from his late teens to at least September 2007, and LSD and methamphetamine in the early 1970s. He also admitted that he had used marijuana, Xanax, and Oxycontin after he had been granted a security clearance, although he denied that he had used Xanax or Oxycontin to the extent alleged. Applicant acknowledged his arrests for drug and drunken driving offenses, as well as his court-ordered substance abuse treatment. He denied that he had deliberately falsified his QNSP or his subject interview. In response to the recent amendment, Applicant admitted that he had lied about his drug use on his initial SF 86. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 57 years old, and he has been employed as an assembler by a defense contractor since November 1982, but for around a year following a layoff in 2002. (Tr. 29.) Applicant has been married to his spouse since September 1982. They have two 4 daughters, who are in their late twenties, unmarried, and have five children between them.

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant abused marijuana, LSD, and methamphetamines during his late teens and \nearly twenties. He ceased his illegal drug use in 1981 only to resume smoking marijuana \naround 1999 or 2000. In 2003, he began abusing Xanax without a prescription. He abused \nboth drugs, for the most part weekly and while he held a security clearance, until his arrest \non felony and misdemeanor drug charges in January 2007. He abused marijuana in \nSeptember 2007 pending his sentencing on those drug charges. Applicant also abused \nalcohol, but he limited his drinking after an August 2003 drunk driving offense. He denied \nany illegal drug use on his initial application for a security clearance, and concealed his \nlatest abuse when he reapplied for his clearance. Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct \nare not mitigated. Clearance denied. \n \n \nStatement of the Case  \n \nOn June 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nH (Drug Involvement), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal \n \nApril 8, 2011\n\n \n \n2 \nConduct), which provided the basis for its preliminary decision to revoke his security \nclearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on July 17, 2009. On August 31, 2009, \nhe indicated that he did not want a hearing. In September 2009, the Government \nrequested a hearing, and on May 11, 2010, the case was assigned to me to consider \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On September 30, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for November 3, \n2010.1 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Nine Government exhibits (Ex. 1-9) and six \nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-F) were entered into evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on November 12, 2010. The SOR was also amended at the \nGovernment\u201fs motion. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, before the introduction of any evidence, the Government moved to \namend the SOR to allege under Guideline H in a new subparagraph 1.h that Applicant \nreceived court-ordered substance abuse treatment from February 2008 to December 2008 \nas set forth in SOR 2.c of Guideline G. Since Applicant had prior notice of the alleged \nsecurity concern, albeit under Guideline G only, and he did not object, I granted the \namendment. \n \n \nThen, after the evidence had been submitted, the Government moved to amend the \nSOR to add a new allegation 3.e under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, based on \nApplicant\u201fs admission that he did not list his marijuana use on his September 2001 security \nclearance application because he did not want to jeopardize his job. Applicant did not \nobject. Accordingly, the SOR was amended to include a new allegation as follows: \n \n3.e. You falsified your September 25, 2001, security clearance application in \nresponse to question 27, \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for \nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, \nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.), \namphetamines, \nbarbiturates, \nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or \nprescription drugs?,\u201d by failing to disclose that you had used marijuana in \napproximately 1999 and 2000. \n                                                 \n1 It is unclear what delayed assignment of the case for a hearing. The hearing was scheduled to maximize \nthe Government\u201fs travel to this region. \n\n \n \n3 \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \nThe amended SOR alleged under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, that Applicant \nused marijuana with varying frequency from his late teens to at least September 2007 \n(SOR 1.a), non-prescribed Xanax (SOR 1.b) and Oxycontin (SOR 1.c) from about 1970 to \nat least January 2007, LSD (SOR 1.d), and methamphetamine (SOR 1.e). Applicant was \nalso alleged to have used the marijuana, Xanax, and Oxycontin after he had been granted \na security clearance in about November 2001 (SOR 1.f); to have been arrested and \nconvicted of January 2007 drug possession and driving under the influence of alcohol or \ndrugs charges (SOR 1.g); and to have received court-ordered substance abuse treatment \nfrom February 2008 to December 2008 (SOR 1.h). \n \nThe January 2007 driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs offense and \nsubstance abuse treatment were also alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n(SOR 2.b and 2.c). Also under Guideline G, Applicant was allegedly arrested and convicted \nof an August 2003 driving while intoxicated charge (SOR 2.a). \n \nApplicant\u201fs use of marijuana, Xanax, and Oxycontin after he had been granted a \nsecurity clearance was cross-alleged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct (SOR 3.a). \nFurthermore, he was alleged under Guideline E to have deliberately falsified his January \n2008 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP) by omitting his August 2003 \nDWI in response to question 23 concerning his police record (SOR 3.b) and by \nmisrepresenting the extent of his drug use in response to question 24 concerning any \nillegal drug use in the last seven years (SOR 3.d). Applicant also allegedly falsified material \nfacts during his March 2008 interview with an authorized investigator by denying that he \nhad used any illegal drugs after January 2007 when he had used marijuana in September \n2007 (SOR 3.c). Furthermore, Applicant was alleged to have falsified his September 2001 \n(SF 86) security clearance application by denying any illegal drug use within the preceding \nseven years (SOR 3.e). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana from his late teens to \nat least September 2007, and LSD and methamphetamine in the early 1970s. He also \nadmitted that he had used marijuana, Xanax, and Oxycontin after he had been granted a \nsecurity clearance, although he denied that he had used Xanax or Oxycontin to the extent \nalleged. Applicant acknowledged his arrests for drug and drunken driving offenses, as well \nas his court-ordered substance abuse treatment. He denied that he had deliberately \nfalsified his QNSP or his subject interview. In response to the recent amendment, Applicant \nadmitted that he had lied about his drug use on his initial SF 86. His admissions are \nincorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 57 years old, and he has been employed as an assembler by a defense \ncontractor since November 1982, but for around a year following a layoff in 2002. (Tr. 29.) \nApplicant has been married to his spouse since September 1982. They have two \n\n \n \n4 \ndaughters, who are in their late twenties, unmarried, and have five children between them. \nThe daughters and grandchildren live with Applicant and his spouse. (Ex. 1; 5; A.) \nApplicant\u201fs spouse is disabled and has a disability benefit. (Tr. 30.) \n \nApplicant began smoking marijuana around age 16. He smoked it once weekly and \npurchased it from street dealers until about May 1981, when his first daughter was born. \n(Tr. 27-28.)  During his late teens and early twenties, he used and purchased LSD on five \noccasions that he can specifically recall. For about a year in his early twenties, he ingested \n$5 worth of crystal methamphetamine once a week, which he purchased. He apparently \nalso used cocaine.2 (Tr. 38-39.) \n \nApplicant used no illegal drugs from about May 1981 to 1999 or 2000, when he \nresumed smoking marijuana about once a week, to deal with the stress of a potential job \nlayoff. (Tr. 28-29.) On January 12, 2001, Applicant\u201fs father died in an accident. (Tr. 41.) On \nSeptember 25, 2001, Applicant applied for a Confidential security clearance for his job. He \ncompleted a security clearance application (SF 86) on which he responded \u201cNo\u201d to \nquestion 27 concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years. (Ex. 2.) Applicant did \nnot indicate on his SF 86 that he had resumed his marijuana use because he was not \nproud of it and thought it would jeopardize his job. (Tr. 79.) He was apparently granted a \nConfidential security clearance around November 20013 (Ex. 1; 2.), but was laid off around \n2002 for a little over a year. During his layoff, he supported his family with his \nunemployment compensation. (Tr. 29.) He enjoyed marijuana\u201fs relaxing effects, and \ncontinued to smoke the illegal drug occasionally, up to once weekly at times. He bought the \nmarijuana from street dealers. (Tr. 30.) Applicant, who had been a weekend drinker, began \nconsuming alcohol during the week as well, and \u201cit snowballed from there.\u201d (Tr. 73.) \n \nIn June 2002, Applicant left the scene of an accident involving property damage \nwithout notifying the police or property owner. Three days after the accident, he was \nquestioned by police. He led the officer to believe that another driver had been involved. \nOn July 16, 2002, he appeared in court on charges of leaving the scene of an accident and \nfiling a false report to law enforcement. He pleaded guilty to both charges and was \nsentenced to fines and assessments totaling $600 for leaving the scene and $1,250 ($250 \nsuspended) for filing a false report. (Ex. 8.) There is no indication that Applicant was under \nthe influence of a controlled substance or alcohol before the incident, although he was \ndrinking alcohol and smoking marijuana at that time of his life. He drank beer, vodka, or \ntequila, usually at home, in quantities varying from two to ten drinks per occasion. (Ex. 3; \nTr. 72.)  \n                                                 \n2 During his February 2008 evaluation for court-ordered counseling, Applicant apparently admitted to a history \nof substance use which included cocaine. (Ex. 5. ) Applicant was not asked about any cocaine use, and it was \nnot raised as an issue in the SOR. \n \n3Applicant indicated on his January 2008 QNSP (pages 6 through 27 of his Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP)), that his background was investigated for a Confidential security clearance \naround November 2000. (Ex. 1.)  Applicant\u201fs employer certified a request for a Confidential security clearance \nfor him in conjunction with a security clearance application signed on September 25, 2001. (Ex. 2.) So it would \nappear that Applicant\u201fs background was investigated in 2001 rather than 2000. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant was charged with operating under the influence of alcohol \n(OUI), first offense.4 He had consumed six alcohol drinks (\u201cSmirnoff Ices\u201d) over a three-\nhour period and had smoked marijuana at a card game before his arrest. (Tr. 50-51.) In \nOctober 2003, he appeared in court without counsel and pleaded guilty. Applicant was \nsentenced to fines and assessments totaling $420 and he lost his license for 90 days. (Ex. \n7.) He also completed a mandatory driving while intoxicated course and three follow-up \ncounseling sessions. (Ex. 5.) \n \nFor the most part, Applicant stopped drinking alcohol after the OUI5 (Tr. 34.), but he \ncontinued to smoke marijuana up to once a week. (Tr. 30.) He also began to take an anti-\ndepressant (Xanax) without a prescription to relieve \u201cthe pressures of the job and the \npressures of life\u201d (Tr. 33.), including depression over his father\u201fs death. (Tr. 42.) He abused \nXanax three days a week; on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. (Tr. 34.) Applicant \nobtained the Xanax from his cousin, who himself did not have a prescription for the drug. \n(Tr. 35.) Applicant continued to abuse marijuana and Xanax, for the most part weekly, until \nJanuary 2007. (Tr. 30, 35.) \n \nOn January 11, 2007, Applicant took some non-prescribed Oxycontin offered to him \nby his cousin. They were playing cards and Applicant complained of neck pain. (Tr. 36.) \nThe next day, Applicant drank an ounce of vodka at his father\u201fs gravesite as he did every \nyear on the anniversary of his father\u201fs death. Applicant then went to friend\u201fs home to play \ncards, where he smoked marijuana that he had purchased from a street dealer and he also \ningested four Xanax. (Tr. 43-44.) En route home, Applicant fell asleep and crashed his \nvehicle. He tested positive for controlled substances (marijuana, Xanax, and Oxycontin) at \nthe hospital (Ex. 3.), and he had in his possession 85 Xanax pills and 1.5 ounces of \nmarijuana. (Tr. 44.) Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or a \ncontrolled drug (DUI/drug), possession of a controlled drug, and felony possession of a \nnarcotic. On January 13, 2007, he was released on $800 personal recognizance bail \nconditioned on refraining from alcohol abuse, any use of a narcotic or controlled drug, and \nnot operating a motor vehicle until his license was restored. (Ex. 3; 6.) \n \nOn September 4, 2007, Applicant smoked a marijuana cigarette to deal with the \npressure of his court appearance scheduled for the next day. (Tr. 31.) Applicant bought the \ndrug from a street dealer. (Tr. 82.) Applicant denies he was ordered to refrain from illegal \n                                                 \n4 The SOR alleges that Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated. Available court records indicate \nthat the charge was operating under the influence, first offense. \n \n5 When discussing his January 12, 2007, arrest with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \non March 11, 2008, Applicant indicated that as he did every year on the anniversary of his father\u201fs death, he \nbrought two nips containing one ounce of vodka. He dumped one on his father\u201fs grave and drank the other. \n(Ex. 3.) At his hearing, he testified that he had not consumed any alcohol from his 2003 OUI until January 12, \n2007. When asked whether he brought vodka with him to his father\u201fs gravesite before 2007, Applicant \nresponded, \u201cNo. Well, yeah, I did. I did bring vodka and I poured it on his grave.\u201d He denied he took a drink on \nthose other occasions, but he had no explanation for what then prompted him to drink the vodka in January \n2007.  (Tr. 43.) His admission during his interview is considered more credible. \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \ndrug involvement before his sentencing (Tr. 53.), although court records show a condition \nof his release on bail was that he not abuse any controlled substance. (Ex. 6.) On \nSeptember 5, 2007, Applicant pleaded guilty to all charges. For the felony drug possession, \nhe was sentenced to 12 months in the house of corrections (suspended), two years \nprobation, $350 fine and assessments, evaluation by a licensed alcohol and drug \ncounselor (LADC), and completion of any counseling or treatment as directed by \ncorrectional or probation authority. He was sentenced on the misdemeanor marijuana \npossession charge to a six-month concurrent jail term (suspended), and $350 fine and \npenalty assessment (suspended for two years). For the DUI/drug offense, he was given a \nconsecutive sentence of 12 months in jail, all but 60 days suspended to commence \nNovember 23, 2007; seven days in a multiple DWI offender intervention detention center \nimmediately on release from the house of corrections; two years probation; three years \nloss of license; a $750 fine and penalty assessment; and a substance abuse evaluation \nwith completion of any treatment or counseling directed by the department of corrections. \n(Ex. 6.) \n \nApplicant completed the multiple offender program on December 13, 2007. (Ex. 5; \nF.) He was referred to outpatient counseling for a minimum of 12 months, to commence \nimmediately. (Ex. 5.) Applicant was credited with good time served and released early from \nconfinement on January 9, 2008. (Ex. 6.) \n \n \nOn January 15, 2008, Applicant signed a QNSP incorporated within an e-QIP. He \ndisclosed his January 2007 drug possession, marijuana possession, and DUI/drug \ncharges, in response to the police record inquiries. He also responded affirmatively to the \nillegal drug and drug activity inquiries under section 24, including whether he had used a \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance. Applicant indicated that he \nused marijuana and \u201czannex\u201d [sic] from March 2005 to January 2007 \u201c100 occasional\u201d \ntimes.  He made his \u201cbest guess\u201d about the extent of his marijuana use in the preceding \nseven years. (Tr. 69.) Applicant did not disclose his August 2003 OUI offense on his \nQNSP, but he listed counseling from October 2003 to November 2003 in response to \nquestion 25, \u201cIn the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, \nwine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or \nalcoholism)?\u201d (Ex. 1.) When asked at his November 2010 hearing on his security clearance \neligibility about his failure to list his 2003 OUI, Applicant responded, \u201cThe only thing I can \ncome up with is that I was depressed at the time. I thought that what I put on the report was \nenough to have my security clearance pulled and I didn\u201ft think it would go any further than \nthat.\u201d (Tr. 65-66.) He also attributed the omission to a right to privacy, although then \nadmitted that he did not want to lose his job. (Tr. 66-67.) He had no explanation for listing \nthe program he attended because of the OUI but not the OUI offense itself (Tr. 67.), but he \ndenied any intentional concealment. (Tr. 71-72.)  \n \n \nAround February 21, 2008, Applicant had an intake evaluation for his court-ordered \n12 months of outpatient counseling. Applicant reported a last use of Xanax and Oxycontin \n\u201cafter his accident,\u201d and a last use of cannabis in September 2007. He denied any triggers, \ncravings, or withdrawal symptoms, and was considered to be open to counseling. From \nMarch 2008 through January 2009, Applicant attended monthly outpatient individual \n\n \n \n7 \ncounseling sessions with a licensed alcohol and drug counselor (LADC), who is a licensed \nsocial worker, for diagnosed sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic abuse. (Ex. 5; A.) Applicant \nhad thoughts of taking Xanax while coping with the stress of his stepfather\u201fs Alzheimer\u201fs \ndisease and his mother moving in with his family in mid-2008, but there is no evidence that \nhe turned to alcohol or drugs. (Ex. 5; Tr. 80-81.)  \n \n  \nOn March 11, 2008, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he had smoked \nmarijuana and taken a Xanax pill before his arrest in January 2007. He indicated that the \nXanax was given to him by a cousin, but he had purchased the marijuana from an \nunknown dealer. Applicant acknowledged that he had 85 Xanax pills and 1.5 ounces of \nmarijuana in his possession when he was arrested. Applicant indicated that he had been \ncompletely abstinent from alcohol and drugs since his arrest in January 2007 and he had \nno intent to use alcohol or any drug illegally again. (Ex. 3.) At his hearing, he admitted that \nhe had not disclosed his September 2007 use of marijuana to the investigator, but he \nindicated it was because he had forgotten about it and was very nervous during the \ninterview. (Tr. 63.) \n \n \nApplicant was released from his probation on July 15, 2009, after completing 21 \nmonths of a 24-month sentence. He had completed all requirements of his probation, \nincluding testing negative for substance abuse in the three or four drug screens that were \nadministered (Tr. 74.), remaining gainfully employed, paying all fines, and completing the \nmultiple offender program. (Ex. F.)  \n \n \nApplicant became eligible to regain his driver\u201fs license in early September 2010, but \nhe needed an evaluation showing he was at low risk to reoffend. (Tr. 43, 46-47.) On \nOctober 5, 2010, he returned to the counseling center for a substance use evaluation. \nApplicant reported that he had experienced some stressors since he completed his \ncounseling in January 2009, most notably serious health issues involving his wife, mother, \nand his stepfather. He denied any legal history since his 2007 DUI/drug arrest, but also \ndenied that he had ever been on probation. Applicant informed the LADC that he was now \ntaking prescribed Wellbutrin to manage symptoms of depression and anxiety with good \neffect. He reported no substance abuse since January 2007 and no cravings or thoughts of \nusing illegal drugs. The LADC found Applicant to be at low risk to reoffend, and he \nrecommended no further treatment. In his opinion, Applicant had identified \u201ca supportive \nfamily, stable employment, and a wide variety of coping skills that have helped him to \nmaintain abstinence.\u201d He gave Applicant a diagnosis of anxiolytic dependence without \nphysiological dependence in sustained full remission by history, cannabis abuse by history, \nand alcohol abuse by history. (Ex. A.) The LADC\u201fs evaluation was pending review by the \nmultiple offender program as of Applicant\u201fs hearing on his security clearance eligibility. (Tr. \n47.) \n \nWhen confronted at his November 2010 security clearance hearing about his \nreported denials in October 2010 of any substance abuse since January 2007 and of ever \nhaving been on probation, Applicant acknowledged that the reference to no probation was \n\u201ca mistake\u201d that he did not know was in the LADC\u201fs report. He asserted that he had \ndiscussed his probation with the LADC during his year-long counseling with him. (Tr. 56-\n\n \n \n8 \n57.) Available records of Applicant\u201fs previous counseling sessions (Ex. 5.) do not confirm \nany discussion about his probationary status, although they reveal that Applicant had \ndiscussed his jail stay with the LADC. Applicant also testified that he informed the LADC in \nOctober 2010 about his marijuana use in September 2007, but when then asked what he \ntold the LADC, Applicant responded, \u201cI don\u201ft think I said\u2014it didn\u201ft even come up.\u201d (Tr. 60.) \n \nApplicant denies that he has socialized with the friends or his cousin since the \nincident in January 2007 (Tr. 43, 85.), and there is no evidence in the record to the \ncontrary. He learned through his counseling to \u201ctake things as they come.\u201d (Tr. 48.) His \nbiggest fear is the loss of his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 49.) Applicant does not intend to \ndrink alcohol or to abuse any drug in the future. He has been taking Wellbutrin for about a \nyear to deal with his anxiety and depression. (Tr. 75.) There is no indication that he took \nthe drug other than prescribed. \n \nThe three coworkers who submitted references on his behalf have known Applicant \nfor some time. Applicant has shown himself to be a hard worker, reliable, and trustworthy. \n(Ex. B; C; D.) Applicant testified that these coworkers and his supervisors are aware of his \npast drug abuse (Tr. 75.), although none of the coworkers commented about his drug \nabuse. A friend of Applicant\u201fs for the last 30 years believes that Applicant has accepted \nresponsibility \u201cfor his past errors in judgment.\u201d (Ex. E.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u201eright\u201f to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u201fs suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u201fs eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u201fs overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n9 \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See \nalso EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an illegal \ndrug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u201fs reliability \nand trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u201fs ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 24(a), drugs are defined as \u201cmood and behavior altering substances,\u201d \nand include: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens),6 and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 24(b), drug abuse is defined as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a \nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d Several \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 are implicated. \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies because of Applicant\u201fs abuse during his late \nteens and early twenties of marijuana, LSD, crystal methamphetamines, and perhaps even \ncocaine; his abuse of marijuana, for the most part weekly, from 1999 or 2000 through \nJanuary 12, 2007, and on September 4, 2007; his abuse of Xanax without a prescription on \nthe weekends from 2003 through January 12, 2007; and his abuse of non-prescribed \n                                                 \n6Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. \n\n \n \n10 \nOxycontin on January 11, 2007. AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use,\u201d has \nlimited applicability in that Applicant apparently tested positive for Xanax and marijuana in \nthe hospital following his January 12, 2007 accident. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d is established by Applicant\u201fs years of purchase of \nmarijuana from street dealers. He also bought the LSD and methamphetamine that he \nused as a youth. Applicant had possession of Oxycontin when he used it on January 11, \n2007, although it is unclear whether he paid his cousin for the drug. Applicant paid his \ncousin for the Xanax, apparently including the 85 pills that he had in his possession on \nJanuary 12, 2007. \n \nAG \u00b6 25(e), \u201cevaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized treatment program,\u201d is also pertinent. \nThe licensed social worker/LADC, with whom Applicant completed his court-ordered \ncounseling, diagnosed Applicant with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic abuse in February \n2008. Applicant was recently reevaluated by the LADC in October 2010, and diagnosed in \npart with anxiolytic dependence without physiological dependence in sustained full \nremission by history and with cannabis abuse by history. \n \nThe Government\u201fs case for AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a \nsecurity clearance,\u201d is based on Applicant\u201fs admission that he abused marijuana, Xanax, \nand Oxycontin after he had been granted a Confidential security clearance. The \nGovernment presented no independent evidence to confirm the date the clearance was \ngranted, although JPAS entry shows Applicant\u201fs background was investigated from \nSeptember 27, 2001 to November 20, 2001. So presumably sometime around November \n2001, Applicant was granted his security clearance. Applicant abused marijuana and \nXanax frequently, if not regularly, thereafter, and he abused Oxycontin at least once. \n \nApplicant satisfies several components of the relevant mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a), 26(b), and 26(d). He has not abused LSD, methamphetamine, or any cocaine for \nover 30 years, so his abuse of those drugs would fall within AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u201fs current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The evidence is sufficient to establish only the one-\ntime use of Oxycontin, which he abused on January 11, 2007. It cannot be inferred from \nApplicant\u201fs admission to the LADC of \u201ca history of substance use including alcohol, \nmarijuana, LSD, crystal meth, cocaine, Oxycontin, and Xanex [sic],\u201d that he used Oxycontin \nmore frequently, or from 1970 to January 2007 as alleged in the SOR. However, \nApplicant\u201fs dated drug abuse as a youth, and his more recent but infrequent use of \nOxycontin, cannot be evaluated in isolation from his frequent, if not regular, abuse of \nmarijuana and Xanax. Although more than three years have passed since his last uses of \nmarijuana and Xanax, his illegal drug abuse was not \u201cso long ago,\u201d especially in light of his \nrelapse into weekly marijuana use after 18 years of abstinence, and his resort to Xanax to \ndeal with the pressures of life. \n \n\n \n \n11 \nAG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d applies in \npart in that Applicant\u201fs unrebutted testimony is that he has not associated since January \n2007 with the friends with whom he abused drugs while playing cards. He also denies that \nhe has seen the cousin who supplied him the Xanax. But Applicant\u201fs marijuana use was \nnot dependent on his friends or a relative. Applicant purchased marijuana from street \ndealers and he used the drug alone at his home, including in September 2007. So while \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d applies, it does \nnot mitigate fully the concerns where Applicant sought out marijuana himself time and time \nagain from persons unknown to him. For that same reason, AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used,\u201d is not applicable. As for whether \nApplicant has shown \u201can appropriate period of abstinence\u201d required under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \nhis present three years of abstinence is alone insufficient to mitigate the drug concerns in \nlight of his relapse history. \n \nSome consideration must be afforded AG \u00b6 26(d), \u201csatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare \nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.\u201d Applicant completed a court-mandated multiple offender program in \nDecember 2007 and attended required aftercare counseling with the LADC from March \n2008 to January 2009. These programs were sufficient for the court to release Applicant \nfrom probation early. On October 5, 2010, Applicant had another substance abuse \nevaluation by the LADC, who determined Applicant was at low risk to reoffend; that his \nanxiolytic dependence was in sustained, full remission. This LADC is not a duly qualified \nmedical professional, which is defined in AG 25(d) as a \u201cphysician, clinical psychologist, or \npsychiatrist.\u201d That said, the LADC is recognized by the court to provide substance abuse \ncounseling, presumably because of his experience and expertise in that area. But his \nrecent evaluation report has been shown to be inaccurate in some important aspects \n(\u201c[Applicant] reports that his last DWI charge resulted in serving some jail time; however, \nhe has never been on probation or parole;\u201d \u201c[Applicant] denies any problems with \nsubstance use since that incident and reports that he has maintained abstinence since his \narrest. His last reported use of any substance was in January 2007 and he reports no \ncravings or thoughts of using. . . .\u201d).  The evidence shows that Applicant had acknowledged \nto the LADC during their February 2008 session that his last use of cannabis was in \nSeptember 2007. However, nowhere in his October 2010 evaluation does the LADC \naddress this significant discrepancy concerning Applicant\u201fs last reported abuse of a \ncontrolled substance. \n \nThe weight to be afforded the LADC\u201fs recent assessment is undermined to the \nextent it may be based on inaccurate reports from Applicant in October 2010 about his \ndrug abuse, or on the clinician\u201fs failure to fully review his previous counseling records. \nApplicant testified at his hearing that he did not recall what he told the LADC about his last \nuse of marijuana, even though the evaluation was only the month before his hearing. He \nclaimed to not recall if the subject was broached, although the matter was clearly \ndiscussed, as Applicant told the LADC that he had been abstinent since his arrest. Not \nknowing whether the LADC\u201fs assessment would change if he knew Applicant had not been \nfully candid with him, I cannot give controlling weight to the LADC\u201fs favorable prognosis or \n\n \n \n12 \nfully apply AG \u00b6 26(d). Moreover, Applicant\u201fs reform is undermined to the extent that he \njustifies his use of marijuana in September 2007 on the basis that he had not been ordered \nto stay away from the drug until his hearing on September 5, 2007. His release on bail was \nconditioned on avoiding all use of illegal drugs. The Drug Involvement concerns are not \nsufficiently mitigated. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nThe concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u201fs reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nApplicant abused alcohol at times until his arrest for drunk driving in August 2003. \nHe drank from two to ten alcohol drinks (beer, vodka, or tequila) per occasion, initially on \nweekends and then during the week. Three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 are \nestablished. His August 2003 OUI implicates AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away \nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, \ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d applies to those \noccasions (albeit the dates and frequency are not clearly delineated in the record other \nthan the August 2003 OUI) where he drank five or more alcohol drinks at a sitting. AG \u00b6 \n22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social \nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d is implicated \nbecause the LADC diagnosed Applicant with alcohol abuse, by history, in October 2010. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied consuming any alcohol between his August 2003 \nOUI and January 2007, when he drank an ounce of vodka at his father\u201fs gravesite. There is \nother evidence to substantiate that he drank vodka on each anniversary of his father\u201fs \ndeath. (Ex. 3.) Even so, his drinking was limited and not to abusive levels after his August \n2003 OUI. The January 2007 incident involved illegal drug use, not alcohol abuse. AG \u00b6 \n23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u201fs current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is established by no \nevidence of alcohol abuse since August 2003. His counseling for substance abuse from \nMarch 2008 to January 2009 was not voluntary, but Applicant has committed himself to an \nalcohol-free lifestyle. AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or \nissues of abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol \nabuser),\u201d applies. While he has not been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous or similar \norganization that could support him in his efforts to abstain completely from alcohol, he did \ncomplete a court-mandated alcohol education program after his OUI. AG \u00b6 23(d) (\u201cthe \nindividual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation \nalong with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such \n\n \n \n13 \nas participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has \nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d) is \nsatisfied only in part, but the Alcohol Consumption concerns are mitigated by his \ncommitment to sobriety for a sustained period sufficient to guarantee against relapse. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u201fs reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant\u201fs frequent abuse of marijuana and Xanax, and on one occasion \nOxycontin, after he had been granted a security clearance (SOR 3.a), raises the Personal \nConduct security concerns identified in AG \u00b6 15. Even if he was unaware that illicit drug \ninvolvement was prohibited for those persons holding positions of trust, he knew that his \nconduct was illegal. Furthermore, Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 27 concerning any \nillegal drug use in the last seven years when he completed his September 2001 SF 86 \n(SOR 3.e) because he feared the loss of his job if his ongoing marijuana use was known. \nApplicant\u201fs false response to the drug inquiry on his SF 86 implicates AG \u00b6 \n16(a),\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \nOn his January 2008 QNSP, Applicant revealed his felony drug conviction in \nresponse to the police record inquiries. Yet, he omitted his August 2003 OUI (SOR 3.a) \nwhile reporting in the alcohol use section that he had received alcohol counseling from \nOctober 2003 to November 2003. Concerning his failure to list the OUI, Applicant initially \ntestified, \u201cThe only thing I can come up with is that I was depressed at the time. I thought \nthat what I put on the report was enough to have my security clearance pulled and I didn\u201ft \nthink it would go any further than that.\u201d (Tr. 65-66.) He subsequently acknowledged that he \ndid not disclose the offense out of concern for his job (Tr. 66-67.), albeit he continues to \ndeny intentional concealment. (Tr. 71-72.) Applicant had an obligation to disclose a known \noffense, even if the Government would likely have found out about the OUI through the \nlisted counseling.  AG \u00b6 16(a) also applies to the omission of the August 2003 OUI from his \nQNSP. \n \nConcerning his response to the QNSP\u201fs drug questions, Applicant indicates he \nsigned releases, completed forms as required, and did not intend to conceal any \n\n \n \n14 \ninformation. As for his disclosure only of \u201coccasional\u201d Xanax and marijuana use 100 times \nfrom March 2005 to January 2007, Applicant maintains it was only an estimate, that he \ndidn\u201ft think much about his use of marijuana before 2005, and that he did not remember \nthings (\u201cI\u201fm not a lawyer. I have a 12th grade education. I get very nervous talking around \npeople. If I didn\u201ft remember things, that\u201fs me\u201d). (Tr. 71.) Even if I accept that Applicant was \nuncertain about when he started abusing Xanax, it is difficult to believe that he did not \nrecall in January 2008 that he smoked marijuana in September 2007 to deal with the stress \nof his imminent sentencing in part for a felony drug offense. He had no trouble recalling his \nuse of marijuana in September 2007 when he was evaluated by the LADC in February \n2008. (Ex. 5.) Yet, when he was interviewed in March 2008, he denied any substance \nabuse after his January 2007 arrest. Not only was his marijuana use in September 2007 \ntoo recent to be easily forgotten, but the omission of that abuse from his security clearance \napplication and then his interview show a pattern of intentional concealment, especially \nwhen he was able to recall that abuse in the interim in a context unrelated to his \nbackground investigation for his clearance. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to his QNSP omissions. AG \n\u00b6 16(d), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to \nan employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official \ngovernment representative,\u201d applies to his failure to disclose his September 2007 \nmarijuana use during his subject interview (SOR 3.c). \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of any effort by him to correct his September 2001 \nSF 86 falsification until January 2008, when he made a partial disclosure of his drug \ninvolvement on his QNSP. His misrepresentation on his SF 86 is not mitigated by AG \u00b6 \n17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, \nor falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d Furthermore, given Applicant\u201fs \nomission of his August 2003 OUI charge and his September 2007 marijuana abuse from \nhis January 2008 QNSP, and his false statement during his subject interview about when \nhe last used a controlled substance, AG \u00b6 17(a) and AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, \nor so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u201fs \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d are not mitigating of the Personal Conduct \nconcerns. \n \n \nReform considerations addressed in AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged \nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d are not firmly \nestablished. Applicant has a track record of concealing his September 2007 marijuana use, \nand that conduct likely extends to his October 2010 evaluation. The LADC indicated in his \nreport that Applicant had not used any illegal drug since January 2007, and that Applicant \nhad never been on probation. In the absence of credible evidence showing Applicant was \nnot the source of the false information, I remain concerned about Applicant\u201fs candor and \nwhether he can be counted on to fulfill the fiduciary obligations of a security clearance. \n\n \n \n15 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u201fs eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u201fs age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nA coworker described Applicant as \u201ca very good family man\u201d (Ex. D.), and that is \nborne out in part. He put his drug abuse behind him for about 18 years while he and his \nspouse raised their daughters. Applicant opened his home to his two daughters and their \nchildren. It was concern over a possible layoff, and the loss of income needed to support \nhis family, that led him to resume marijuana use in 1999 or 2000. But concerns about his \njob do not justify his years of drug abuse or his concealment of his drug involvement from \nthe Government. His enjoyment of marijuana took precedence over his good judgment and \nhis fiduciary obligations as a cleared employee. He sought out marijuana from street \ndealers, even while facing serious drug charges. He abused Xanax, which he obtained \nfrom a cousin, until his arrest for felony narcotic possession. He hid his illegal drug abuse \nfrom the Government in September 2001, and was not fully candid on a reapplication for \nhis clearance in January 2008, or during his subject interview in March 2008. Applicant \ndoes not intend to abuse any illegal drug or alcohol in the future, and he has been a good \nworker for his employer. But he has not fully mitigated the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness concerns raised by his serious drug abuse history and his lack of full \ncandor during the investigation and adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n16 \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 28, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated February 5, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On May 19,\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which\ndetailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 10, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on August 4, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on August 12, 2009,\nand the hearing was scheduled for September 22, 2009.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4.\nThe Applicant presented six exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F.\nHe also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business\non September 29, 2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional\n\n2\ndocumentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing exhibit, consisting of twenty\npages, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was admitted without\nobjection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on October 5, 2009.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 39 years old and has a high school\ndiploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Material Warehouse Specialist\nand is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant denies allegation 1(a), and admits allegation 1(b), set forth under\nthis guideline.  (See Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR dated July 10, 2009).  The\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)\ndated February 5, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  Section 22 of the questionnaire,\nregarding his employment history, asked him, among other things, if in the last seven\nyears he had ever been fired, quit or left a job.  The Applicant responded, \u201cNO\u201d.\n(Government Exhibit 1).  This was an incorrect answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose\nthat he had been terminated from his employment in June 2003, for failing a drug test.\n(Government Exhibit 2).    \nQuestion 24 of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if, since the age of\nsixteen or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter, he had illegally used any\ncontrolled substance.  The Applicant responded, \u201cNO\u201d.  This was an incorrect answer.\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that he had used marijuana in the last seven years, with\nthe last time being on June 20, 2003.  (Government Exhibit 2).  \n  \nThe Applicant initially stated that he did not knowingly or purposely falsified his\nanswers on the application.  He testified that he stopped using marijuana in 2001.  (Tr.\np. 29).  He only used it one time after 2001, but did not remember when that was.  (Tr. p\n30).  At the time he tested positive for marijuana in 2003, and was terminated from his\nemployment, he had not been using marijuana, it was just in his system.  (Tr. p. 31).  He\nhad heard that it can stay in the system a month or so.  He later testified that he did not\n\n3\nwant to lose his job, so he marked, \u201cNO\u201d in response to the questions at issue.  (Tr. pp.\n33 and 39).  He was also embarrassed about being fired from his previous job.  (Tr. p.\n33).  He stated that at the time he tested positive for marijuana, he had been around\npeople who had used marijuana, but that he had not used it.  (Tr. p. 42).  Later he\nadmitted that his use of marijuana could have occurred closer to the time he tested\npositive for marijuana in 2003.  (Tr. p. 48).  \nApplicant finally conceded and stated that;\nBecause truthfully, I shouldn\u2019t have anything to hide about the situation.\nBut I made a mistake, and I did put \u201cNO\u201d down because I didn\u2019t want to\nlose my job.  And I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.  I mean I have a lots of things\nagainst me at this point, and I didn\u2019t want to lose my job, just as something\nI don\u2019t do anymore, and it was such a long time ago for me.  So, I lied.\n(Tr. p. 44).  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Facility Manager, Work Control\nSupervisor, Project Manager and coworkers attest to his hard working, honest and\ntrustworthy nature.  He is said to have a positive attitude, is a good communicator, is a\nfast learner and works well with his team.  Overall he is highly respected on the job and\nis recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F).  \nApplicant has received numerous certificates of completion and other awards for\nhis work and dedication to his area of expertise.  He has also successfully completed\nthe Los Angeles Marathon showing physical strength, dedication and diligence.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n4\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate a security concern:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n\n5\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been dishonest on his security clearance application.  (Guideline E).  This\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant not only had problems being honest on\nhis security clearance application, but also at the hearing.  Initially, the Applicant was\nunable to clearly explain why he marked \u201cNO\u201d in response to the questions at issue.\nHis testimony was not credible and did not make logical sense.  As the hearing\nprogressed, he realized the importance of being honest and came forward with the fact\nthat he had lied to protect his job.  Based upon his pattern of dishonesty, however, done\nintentionally to conceal the information from the Government, he is ineligible for a\nsecurity clearance at this time.  I have observed and noted, however, the fact that he\nhas outstanding accomplishments in other areas, and that hopefully, he may at some\npoint meet the eligibility requirement for access to classified information.  However,\nunder the guidelines required by the Department of Defense Directive, he is not eligible\nat this time.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E.\n    \n\n6\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.      \nIn total, the Applicant has not demonstrated that he is sufficiently trustworthy to\nmeet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.       \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on \nSeptember 6, 2007.  On February 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \ntrustworthiness concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 13, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 21, 2009.  She denied nine and \nadmitted five of the SOR allegations under Guideline F, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 20, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on May 4, 2009.  DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on May 20, 2009, for a hearing on June 9, 2009.  I convened the hearing as \nscheduled.  The government offered six exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. \n1 \n \nJuly 24, 2009\n\n2 \n \nEx.) 1 through 6, which were received without objection.  Applicant submitted nine \nexhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through I, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on June 24, 2009.  Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on June 1, 2009.  Applicant is entitled \nto 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8).  Applicant discussed with Department \nCounsel the hearing date of June 9, 2009, prior to the Notice of hearing being mailed so \nactual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing.  However, Applicant \nsigned for the Notice of Hearing only 9 days prior to the hearing.  Applicant waived the \n15 days notice requirement (Tr. 4-5). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old and has been a computer programmer for a defense \ncontractor for over two years.  She is a college graduate who is presently taking courses \nunder the auspices of her employer for a master's degree in information systems.  She \nis married with one child.  Applicant completed a financial statement in response to \nInterrogatories.  Her net monthly income is approximately $2,680.  Her husband's net \nmonthly salary is approximately $1,300, for a total family monthly income of $3,980.  \nThe family's combined monthly expense are approximately $3,730, leaving monthly \ndiscretionary disposable funds of $250 (Tr. 28-29, 32-35; Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for \nPublic Trust Position, dated September 6, 2007; Gov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatories, \ndated August 19, 2008).  \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated November 21, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, dated June 18, \n2008; and Gov. Ex. 6, dated November 7, 2007) list the following debts: six medical \naccounts in collection for  $332 (SOR 1.a), $697 (SOR 1.b), $104 (SOR 1.c), $27 (SOR \n1.d), $416 (SOR 1.e), and $30 (SOR 1.f); a credit card account past due for $4,270 \n(SOR 1.g); two credit card accounts to the same creditor for $467 (SOR 1.h), and in \ncollection for $3,503 (SOR 1.i); two telephone debts to different creditors for $582 (SOR \n1.j) and $259 (SOR 1.k); a credit card account in collection for $969 (SOR 1.l); a credit \ncard account in collection for $5,098 (SOR 1.m); and a student loan with a bank in \ncollection for $14,481 (SOR 1.n).   \n \n \nApplicant attributes her delinquent debts to periods of unemployment, lack of \nfinancial education, and financial hardship in 2005/2006.  She had health issues \nassociated with cancer, was a student, and could not find full-time work.  She also \nbecame pregnant which affected her ability to work (Tr. 17-18). \n \n \nApplicant has been working with a bank official since September 2008 to \nrestructure her debt so it can be paid on time.  Through their efforts, she developed a \nplan to restructure her expenses, save funds, and pay off debts in turn.  She has been \nable under the plan to pay creditors and improved her credit score.  Her plan is to \n\n3 \n \ncontinue to save funds monthly until she has sufficient funds to pay the next debt she \nintends to pay.  She made her last payment on the most recent debt paid in March \n2009.  Since then, she has saved $300 towards her next debt to be paid, the debt listed \nat SOR 1.g.  She has been able to save and pay more of her debts since commencing \nwork with her present employer (Tr. 23-28, 37-39, 44-48).   \n \n \nShe has followed her repayment plan and has been able to pay nine of fourteen \nlisted delinquent debts.  SOR 1.a to SOR 1.e are medical debts to the same medical \nfacility.  The debts have been paid in full (Tr. 18; App. Ex. A, Letter, dated March 13, \n2009).  The medical debt at SOR 1.f has also been paid in full (Tr. 19; App. Ex. B, \nReceipt, dated October 3, 2008).  SOR 1.h is a debt to a bank in collection.  It has been \npaid in full (Tr. 20; App. Ex. C, Letter, dated March 13, 2009).  SOR 1.j and 1.k are \ntelephone bills to different companies that have been paid in full (Tr. 21; App. Ex D, \nLetter, dated March 27, 2009; App. Ex. E, Letter, dated March 25, 2009).  Department \ncounsel concurs that the debts have been paid in full (Tr. 23-24).   \n \n \nSOR 1.g, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m. are credit card debts in collection by various collection \nagencies.  Applicant stopped making payments on the credit card in approximately 2005 \nwhen she had trouble with full time employment because of school and health issues.  \nThe debts have not been paid.  Applicant has not used the credit card since October \n2005.  According to her plan, Applicant is saving funds to pay her next debt which is \nSOR 1.g.  She is working with the collection agency creditors to develop a payment \nplan.  After paying each debt in full, she will move to pay the next debt.  Debt 1.n is a \nstudent loan with a private bank that has not been consolidated or deferred.  She has \nother student loans that are deferred since she is in school studying for her master's \ndegree (Tr. 21-24, 28-31, 40-46). \n \n \nApplicant presented letters of commendation and recommendation from a friend, \na co-worker, and supervisors.  The mayor of Applicant's town notes that he has known \nher for a number of years because she worked in his family business.  She is extremely \nefficient, reliable, and trustworthy (App. Ex. F, Letter, undated).  A supervisor notes that \nApplicant has been a model employee who seeks out challenges to enhance her job \nperformance (App. Ex. G, Letter, dated May 4, 2009).  An employer who Applicant \nworks for part time notes that she is a person of integrity and honesty.  Applicant \nhandles business arrangement and funds for the business.  She is dedicated to the \nsafeguarding of funds and is a good young business woman (App. Ex. H, Letter, \nundated).  Applicant's supervisor notes that she has known Applicant since she joined \ntheir company.  Applicant has shared with her and fellow employees what she learned \nabout debt management and paying off debt.  She is always willing to share her \nknowledge with fellow employees.  Applicant is an outstanding professional and an \nasset to the team (App. Ex. I, Letter, dated June 9, 2009).   \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \n\n4 \n \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a public trust concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect sensitive information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit cards and student loans, as \nestablished by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a security \nconcern raising financial consideration disqualifying conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations).  Applicant has paid nine of the fourteen delinquent debts listed.  However, \nfive delinquent debts, four credit cards and one student loan, are over four years old \nindicating a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as an inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts. \n \n \nI considered financial considerations mitigating conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances).  While the debts were incurred some time ago, some have \nonly recently been paid and other debts are still unpaid so they are considered current.  \nThe debts accumulated while Applicant was a student with health problems with a \nyoung baby.  Some of these events are beyond her control but they are still normal \nhappenings in life.  The circumstances can recur.  She is now acting responsibly in \nseeking financial counseling, following professional advice, and developing and \nexecuting a plan to pay her delinquent debts.  These mitigating conditions partially \napply. \n \n \nI have considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \n\n6 \n \nresolved or is under control).  Applicant sought and received assistance from a bank \nofficial on budgeting and developed a plan to pay her delinquent debts.  She followed \nthat plan and sought follow-up advice from the bank official.  Applicant's financial \nproblems are being resolved.   \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic method of handling debts is needed.  Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment.  A \"meaningful track \nrecord\" of debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments or \nreduction of debt through payment of debts.  An applicant is not required to establish \nthat she paid off each and every debt listed.  The entirety of an applicant's financial \nsituation and her actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which \nthat applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic.  There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding \ndebts simultaneously.  Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide \nfor the payment of such debts one at a time.  Likewise, there is no requirement that the \nfirst debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the \nSOR.  All that is required is that Applicant demonstrates she has established a plan to \nresolve her financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant developed with her financial counselor a plan to pay her delinquent \ndebts in turn.  She has a systematic method of handling her delinquent debts.  She \npresented sufficient credible information to establish she followed her plan and paid in \nfull nine of the fourteen delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Appellant has the ability to \npay her remaining five delinquent debts in accordance with her plan.  She is saving \nfunds each month to accumulate a sufficient amount to either pay the next debt on her \nplan or enter a payment plan with the creditor.  She established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt payment by showing actual payment of debts.  Her plan is reasonable \nand permits her to accumulate funds to pay the debts in turn.  She is executing the plan.  \nShe established her good faith effort to satisfy her outstanding debts and mitigate \nsecurity concerns for financial considerations.  Her finances do not indicate a security \nconcern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n7 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant established a meaningful \ntrack record of debt payment.  She paid nine of the fourteen debts in the SOR and has a \ncredible plan to pay the remaining five.  She demonstrated she is responsibly managing \nher finances under the circumstances.  Her management of finances indicates she will \nbe concerned, responsible, and not careless concerning sensitive information.  Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with no questions or \n \n doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising \nfrom his financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied the other allegation (\u00b6 1.c) based on the fact that he did not agree with the amount of money he sends to his family in Iraq. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 42-year-old man who was born and educated in Iraq. He graduated from a technical institute. Applicant was drafted into the Iraqi military and served from 1987 until 1992 (GE 1). He fled Iraq in 1992, and lived in a refugee camp. Applicant requested to come to the U.S. (Tr. 27). He has lived in the United States since August 1992 (Tr. 27). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2000. In 2004, Applicant visited his mother and father in Iraq because they were ill (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He has been employed with his current employer since October 2006 as a translator (GE 1).

On March 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary\ndecision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 6, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on July 28,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 14, 2009. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on September 9, 2009. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted\nin evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted five\nNovember 12, 2009\n\n2\ndocuments (AE A-E), which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) On October 17, 2009. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nrelating to Iraq (Tr.16). The request and the attached documents are included in the\nrecord as Hearing Exhibit I. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings\nof Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a and\n1.b. He denied the other allegation (\u00b6 1.c) based on the fact that he did not agree with\nthe amount of money he sends to his family in Iraq. His admissions are incorporated in\nmy findings of fact. I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old man who was born and educated in Iraq. He graduated\nfrom a technical institute. Applicant was drafted into the Iraqi military and served from\n1987 until 1992 (GE 1). He fled Iraq in 1992, and lived in a refugee camp. Applicant\nrequested to come to the U.S. (Tr. 27). He has lived in the United States since August\n1992 (Tr. 27). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2000. In 2004,\nApplicant visited his mother and father in Iraq because they were ill (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He has\nbeen employed with his current employer since October 2006 as a translator (GE 1).\nApplicant held an interim security clearance for almost three years. He is currently\nworking in Iraq for the U.S. Government.\nApplicant never married and has no children (GE 1). His mother died in 2005. His\nfather died in August 2008 (Tr. 45). Applicant visited his father in Iraq before his death\n(Tr. 45). He spent two weeks in Iraq for the funeral. Applicant has three sisters and three\nbrothers who are citizens and residents of Iraq (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant saw them at his\nfather\u2019s funeral.\nApplicant contacted his parents before they passed away approximately once or\ntwice a year by telephone. He does not send emails. He had some contact with his\nsiblings. They do not work and they have never had any affiliation with the government in\nIraq. They support the U.S. efforts. They would like to live in the United States. Applicant\nacknowledged that he wants to obtain the necessary money to sponsor his family to\nimmigrate to the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is married. She does not work. His middle sister is\nmarried and her husband is a teacher in a public school (Tr. 59). His youngest sister is\nalso married. Her husband is a teacher also. He does not email them. He does not send\nthem money (Tr. 61). \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s family does not know that he is a translator for the United States.\nApplicant told them he works for a plastics company in the United States. (Tr. 47). None\nof his family members have been the victims of violence or have been threatened due to\nApplicant\u2019s work for the United States.  \nBefore his father died, Applicant sent him money for his health expenses (Tr. 50).\nHe acknowledged that every three or four months he sent his parents $200 or $300 to\naid in their health care expenses (SOR 1.c). Applicant has not sent any money to Iraq\nsince his father died in 2008 (Tr. 51).\nIn 2006, Applicant served as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq. He remained\nin his position until he returned to the U.S. in 2009. He resides on U.S. military\ninstallations. He does not leave the compound. He is not permitted to visit his family\nwhile working as a translator (GE 3).\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iraq. He has no desire to permanently return\nto the country. Applicant owns a home in the United States. He has no contact or\naffiliation with any former colleagues in Iraq.\nApplicant asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and love for his work with the Army\n(AE A). He worked in a war zone in Iraq. He worked long hours for six days a week. He\nwent on missions with the U.S. Army. He has willingly put himself in danger every day for\nalmost three years in order to help the United States. Applicant emphasized that he\nwould never betray the United States. \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant breached any security policies or\nprocedures while holding a security clearance in Iraq. He has letters of appreciation for\nhis work in Iraq (AE C-D).\nApplicant presented a 2009 recommendation from a sergeant major who serves\nwith the U.S. Army in Iraq. Applicant has worked closely with his team since March 2006\nfor the Joint Special Operations Task Force. Applicant has provided total commitment to\nthe mission. He has devoted thousands of man-hours to the ongoing war on terrorism\nand stability and support operations inside Iraq. His support has far exceeded the scope\nof his normal duties. He has played an intricate role in protecting U.S. soldiers from\nterrorist attacks, and his analytical input and understanding of the culture, history and\ngeography of the country has contributed to the capture of those responsible for attacks\n(AE C).\nApplicant has several recommendations from other personnel with the U.S. Army.\nHe is lauded for his preparation and motivation. He is described as professional, reliable,\nand honest. He has consistently excelled under demanding conditions at risk to his\npersonal safety (AE A). He is mature, which serves as an advantage. He works long\nhours at a tireless pace in an often thankless environment. He is a man of great courage\nand conviction.\n\n4\nAn Army interrogator who has worked with Applicant and sees him on a daily\nbasis does not doubt his competence or dedication. He believes Applicant is a true U.S.\npatriot. Applicant is the type of person that can be trusted with information (AE D). \nApplicant\u2019s current employer vouches for Applicant\u2019s professionalism and work\nethic. His skill set is second to none. He has the highest recommendation and his skills\nare greatly needed. \nApplicant received several coins while serving as a translator in Iraq. He brought\nthe two coins to the hearing. Applicant received them for his great work in Iraq (Tr. 24).\nHe is noted for his outstanding support of a unit in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was\npraised for his expert linguistic skill and professionalism in his duties from 2006 until\n2009 (AE A-E).   \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Iraq set forth in the Hearing\nExhibits, including the fact that in 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove\nSaddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took\noffice. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence,\nperpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and\nkidnappings have targeted the United States Armed Forces, contractors, and other\ncivilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against terrorists,\nthe threat of terrorism in Iraq remains. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities\nas effectively as state intelligence services.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon an applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\n\n5\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify an applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to an applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant has a father, three brothers, and three sisters who are\ncitizens and residents of Iraq. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges Applicant traveled to Iraq in\nJanuary 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that he sends about $200 to $500 monthly to his family\nin Iraq (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as\nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\n\n6\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b). Applicant\u2019s father died in\n2008. Applicant sent his father money to help him with his medical expenses. Applicant\u2019s\nbrothers and three sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant maintains some\ncontact with them. He visited Iraq in 2004 before he was translator because his mother\nwas ill. He returned to Iraq in 2008 for his father\u2019s funeral. He took an assignment in Iraq\nas a translator, but he acknowledged that his family does not know about his work.\nApplicant\u2019s connections to his family in Iraq could create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween his security obligations and his desire to help them, only in a situation wherein\nthey were taken hostage or otherwise threatened with harm if he did not cooperate.\nNone of them have any government connection or other position in which they could\notherwise benefit from his access to sensitive information or technology. However, under\neither disqualifying condition, security concerns could arise in connection with the\npotential that hostile forces might seek protected information from Applicant by\nthreatening harm to his family members in Iraq. Based on this evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and\n(b) are raised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of\n\n7\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d In 2004, Applicant visited his mother who was ill. At that time,\nhe was not employed as an interpreter with his current employer. Applicant had\ntelephone contact with his father approximately twice a year. Applicant attended his\nfather\u2019s funeral in Iraq when his father died in 2008. The positions and activities of\nApplicant\u2019s siblings in Iraq do not involve the government or military and they would have\nno interest in acquiring protected information. Only their physical presence creates the\npotential that their interest could be threatened to the point that Applicant would confront\na choice between their interest and those of the United States. Because they are\nopposed to terrorism in Iraq, the likelihood of such a situation is substantially reduced.\nThe Iraqi government is a U.S. ally that does not pose an intelligence risk through\nApplicant\u2019s family members, who support the Iraqi and coalition efforts to defeat terrorists\nand establish a working democracy. Thus, this mitigating condition has partial application\nin this case.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n8(b).  Applicant spoke to his undivided loyalty to the United States. Based on his\nrelationship and loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict\nof interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United States since 1992, after\nfleeing Iraq, and did not return to Iraq until his mother\u2019s illness and his father\u2019s funeral.\nHe owns property in the United States. He has worked in the United States for many\nyears. He hopes to bring his siblings to the United States when he can support them\nfinancially. He has endured dangerous conditions in Iraq on behalf of the U.S. Army.\nThere is no evidence that he has connections or contact with any people other than his\nbrothers and sisters in Iraq. He has established application of AG 8(b). \n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the\nU.S. relative to his or her ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.;\nand ,many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7\n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Certain circumstances weigh against\nApplicant in the whole person analysis. First, there is a significant risk of terrorism in Iraq.\nMore importantly for security purposes, terrorists are hostile to the U.S. and actively seek\nclassified information. Terrorists, and even friendly governments, could attempt to use\nApplicant\u2019s sisters and brothers to obtain such information. Second, he was educated in\nIraq and subsequently conscripted into Iraq\u2019s army. Third, his sisters and brothers\nremain citizens of Iraq. Fourth, he has some contact with his siblings. \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security\nclearance. Applicant fled Iraq and lived in refugee camps for two years. Applicant wanted\nto come to the United States. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States\nsince 1992, and has been a naturalized citizen for nine years. He has a strong sense of\npatriotism toward the United States, as witnessed by his dedication and work with the\nU.S. Army. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any action that could cause\npotential harm to the United States. His military supervisors, who work with him daily in a\nwar zone, praised his work in the cause of freedom in Iraq. After fleeing Iraq in 1992, he\nnever returned until his mother and father were gravely ill. He has established his life in\nthe United States. He now owns property in the U.S.\n\n1\nI conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. Assuming\na higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under AG 8 do not\napply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing alone is sufficient\nto support approval of a security clearance in this case.\n9\nApplicant held an interim security clearance during his tenure with the U.S. Army\nwithout indication that he breached security policies or procedures. He served the United\nStates in a dangerous, high-risk situation and his character references establish his\nsignificant contributions to U.S. national security. While that fact is not normally to be\nconsidered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case. No.\n05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) as follows:\nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s\nprior history \nof \ncomplying \nwith \nsecurity \nprocedures and\nregulations significant probative value for purposes of\nrefuting, mitigating, or extenuating the security concerns\nraised by applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying conduct\nor circumstances. See, e.g. ISCR  Case. No. 01-03357 at 4\n(App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No 02-10113 at 4\n(App. Bd. Mr. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. May 30, 2006). However, the Board has\nrecognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B\ncases, where the applicant has established by credible,\nindependent evidence that his compliance with security\nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of\ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant\nmade a significant contribution to the nation\u2019s security. See.\ne.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006).\nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to\nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to\nrecognize, resist, and report to a foreign power\u2019s attempts at\ncoercion or exploitation.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  Overall, the record evidence leaves\n1\nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. \nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 30-year-old network administrator employed by a defense contractor since June 2007. He previously held a clearance as far back as June 2004. When Applicant completed a questionnaire for non-sensitive positions in July 2004 (GE 2), he failed to disclose his marijuana use within the last year (question 14) as required. He justified this omission because he only completed the form in conjunction 2 with his government contractor employment in a position that did not require a clearance. When he became aware of the significance of his drug use as it related to his clearance, he truthfully disclosed his marijuana use on clearance applications in November 2004 (AE A) and August 2007 (GE 1). In the former, he disclosed marijuana use from July 1995 to January 2004; in the latter, he disclosed marijuana use from July 1995 to May 2007. In neither case did he describe the frequency of his use. However, on the August 2007 clearance application, he also disclosed marijuana-related arrests in March and May 2007. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from July 1995 to May 2007. He used marijuana after being granted a security clearance in June 2004. He was arrested 3 for marijuana possession in March and May 2007. The charges were heard together in May 2007.

Applicant answered the SOR 28 April 2009, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 10 April 2009, and I convened a hearing 7 July 2009.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 13 July 2009.\nJuly 29, 2009\n\nApplicant is also alleged to have falsified his marijuana use on a January 2003 clearance application (SOR\n2\n2.e). I find that allegation for Applicant for three reasons. First, the record copy is not signed, and thus\nApplicant did not certify the truth of his entries. Second, Applicant credibly testified that he completed this\napplication as part of the interview process with a company that ultimately did not hire him. Consequently, the\ncompany should not have submitted the application for processing by the government. Finally, consistent with\nthe fact that the company did not hire Applicant, it does not appear that the government began a background\ninvestigation based on this application, and thus could not have been misled. The interim clearance would\nhave been granted simply because there was no derogatory information listed on the form.\nThe SOR alleges the clearance date as January 2003, for an interim clearance. As noted in footnote 2 above,\n3\nthat application was improperly submitted, Applicant was never hired by the company, and he had no reason\nto know that he had been granted a clearance. However, his October 2004 clearance application (AE A)\nestablishes that he knew he had a clearance as of June 2004.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 30-year-old network\nadministrator employed by a defense contractor since June 2007. He previously held a\nclearance as far back as June 2004.\nWhen Applicant completed a questionnaire for non-sensitive positions in July\n2004 (GE 2), he failed to disclose his marijuana use within the last year (question 14) as\nrequired.  He justified this omission because he only completed the form in conjunction\n2\nwith his government contractor employment in a position that did not require a\nclearance. When he became aware of the significance of his drug use as it related to his\nclearance, he truthfully disclosed his marijuana use on clearance applications in\nNovember 2004 (AE A) and August 2007 (GE 1). In the former, he disclosed marijuana\nuse from July 1995 to January 2004; in the latter, he disclosed marijuana use from July\n1995 to May 2007. In neither case did he describe the frequency of his use. However,\non the August 2007 clearance application, he also disclosed marijuana-related arrests in\nMarch and May 2007.\nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from July 1995 to May 2007. He\nused marijuana after being granted a security clearance in June 2004.  He was arrested\n3\nfor marijuana possession in March and May 2007. The charges were heard together in\nMay 2007. Applicant was directed to a drug intervention program, the successful\ncompletion of which would result in the charges being nolle prossed\u2014which they were\nin June 2008. Early in the drug intervention program, Applicant tested positive for\nmarijuana use during two program-directed drug screens.\nIn addition to the two arrests in 2007, Applicant was arrested for reckless driving\nin August 2002. He was later found guilty of a lesser offense and fined. In December\n2008, he was again arrested for reckless driving. He was found guilty and fined.\nAt hearing, explaining his deliberate falsification of his July 2004 questionnaire for\nnon-sensitive positions, Applicant posited that he would feel justified in giving a false\nanswer regarding his marijuana use to individuals without any reason to know the truth\nor any employer with a drug-free workplace policy\u2014in order to get a job with the\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n3\nemployer. He indicated that he probably made such false statements on employment\napplications with two \u201cbig box\u201d employers he worked for before he entered the\nprofessional workplace.\n Applicant\u2019s former facility security officer (FSO) considers him an outstanding,\nsecurity conscious employee. His work and character references (AE B)\u2014who include a\nformer employer, a current co-worker, a current supervisor, and a current\nprofessor\u2014consider Applicant a trustworthy and reliable individual. None of them\nappears to be aware of the issues in the SOR.\nApplicant asserts that he has not used marijuana since May 2007, and has no\nintent to do so. He claims he does not associate any more with marijuana smoking\nacquaintances. He cites his increased maturity, and his understanding of the effect his\ncontinued drug use has on his clearance as reasons he will not use drugs in the future.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial commonsense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst an applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhere a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance\ngoverning the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR\nallegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, an applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.4\n\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse ; (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\n5\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; (g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance.\n\u00b6 26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b6 26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug\n7\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s sporadic marijuana use between July 1995 and May 2007, a\nperiod during which he had a clearance.  However, Applicant has not mitigated the\n5\nsecurity concerns. There was nothing unusual about the circumstances of his marijuana\nuse, so I cannot conclude that the marijuana use is unlikely to recur.  He has not\n6\ndemonstrated intent to not abuse these drugs in the future.  Accepting his claim that he\n7\nhas not used marijuana since May 2007, he was under the threat of criminal penalties\nuntil June 2008, slightly more than a year ago. Without some corroboration of his\nchanged circumstances, his past falsifications make it difficult to credit his claims of\nrehabilitation. While he has satisfactory character and work references, none of them\nappear to be aware of his drug history or past falsifications. Under these circumstances\nI cannot conclude that Applicant is unlikely to use drugs in the future. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his illegal\ndrug use on a questionnaire for non-sensitive positions in July 2004. He had previously\nfalsified employment applications with retail employers. He falsified his questionnaire\nknowing that his drug use was of concern to the government. His statement that he\nwould never falsify a clearance application even though he would\u2014and did\u2014falsify\ninformation on government and retail employment applications is a distinction without a\ndifference. The government is entitled to truthful answers on its forms, whether\ndesigned for assessing suitability for employment or access to classified information.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. His eventual disclosures cannot be considered\neither forthright or prompt. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use shows a\nlack of candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in\nexamining all relevant and material adverse information about an applicant before\nmaking a clearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose\nthat adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or\nconvenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\n\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n8\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n5\nhimself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security\nviolations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on\nto perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate\ngovernment interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Record evidence clearly establishes\nthat Applicant intended to conceal his illegal drug use from the government in July 2004\nto secure his contractor position with a government agency. This conduct violated 18\nU.S.C. \u00a71001,  whether or not he intended only to retain his employment or intended to\n8\neffect the course of an investigation or suitability determination. In addition, reckless\ndriving arrests in August 2002 and December 2008 and drug possession arrests in\nMarch and May 2007 constitute a pattern of misconduct that is neither distant nor\ninfrequent. I resolve Guideline J against Applicant.\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions lead to the same result. Drug abuse,\ncriminal conduct, and falsifications are core security concerns [RAG &2(a)(1)]. His\nbehavior was deliberate and not due to circumstances beyond his control [RAG\n&2(a)(2); RAG &2(a)(5)]. His misconduct was both recent and frequent [RAG &2(a)(3)]. I\nhave considered Applicant\u2019s relative youth, but that consideration does not overcome\nthe adverse inferences of his misconduct, particularly with honesty being a core\nrequirement for access, and not a difficult concept to understand or hold Applicant\u2019s to\n[RAG &2(a)(4).)]. Rehabilitation or behavioral changes are difficult to measure under\nthese circumstances, given the scrutiny Applicant has been under since his drug use\ncame to light [RAG & 2(a)(6)]. He clearly sought to mislead the government about his\ndrug record, or was at least willing to benefit from his misconduct [RAG &2(a)(7)].\nApplicant\u2019s willingness to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests increases his potential vulnerability and he has not demonstrated that the\nmisconduct is unlikely to recur [RAG & 2(a)(8); RAG & 2(a)(9)]. The concern is whether\nApplicant would disclose situations or circumstances, whether deliberate or inadvertent,\nthat raise security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubt\nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug abuse,\ncriminal conduct, and falsifications.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

On July 23, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing security concerns regarding financial considerations (Guideline F). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn August 6, 2008, Applicant signed a notarized document in which he admitted\nfive of eight allegations raised in the SOR. A hearing before an Administrative Judge\nwas requested. I was assigned the case on September 28, 2008, and the parties\nagreed to a hearing date of October 22, 2008. A Notice of Hearing was issued on\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n Tr. 67.\n    1\n Tr. 29-30.\n    2\n Tr. 30.\n    3\n2\nOctober 6, 2008, to that effect. Due to scheduling conflicts, the hearing was moved to\nOctober 23, 2008, pursuant to an Amended Notice of Hearing, issued October 9, 2008.\nThe hearing was timely convened. Department Counsel introduced eight\ndocuments, accepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-8. Applicant\ngave testimony and offered three documents, accepted into the record without objection\nas Exs. A-C. Two witnesses gave testimony on behalf of the Applicant. Applicant was\ngiven until November 4, 2008, to submit any additional documents for consideration.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on October 31, 2008. No additional documents were\nforwarded for admission. The record was closed on November 7, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, testimony, and exhibits presented, Applicant failed to carry his\nburden and mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 76-year-old architect and businessman who was raised and\neducated in the same region in which he resides today. He has been married for nearly\n50 years and the two have lived in the same city throughout their marriage. As a\nresident, Applicant is a widely respected member of his community.  He is recognized\n1\nfor his civic activities, having served in important capacities for his church, the local\nhospital, symphony, and other organizations. \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in building technology in 1955 and a\nsecond bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering about a decade later. After several years\nworking as a consultant in the areas of architecture, engineering, and land\ndevelopment, Applicant went into business for himself in the mid-1960s as a civil\nengineering consultant. His area of expertise was in hydro-engineering. In this capacity,\nhe has been regularly hired by state, regional, and municipal entities to design water\nsupply, storage, and distribution systems, sewage collections systems, and water\npurification systems.  \n2\nSuch jobs are considered long term projects, entailing months of design before\nmonths of production and completion.  Payment for the assignments usually takes\n3\nplace around the time actual construction begins. To fund his business until payment\nbegan, he generally would rely on a line of credit issued by a local bank. By the time the\nbank issued him a check on his line of credit, preliminary, pre-construction work on the\nproject would have commenced and money already obligated to employees, suppliers,\nand to himself. As a consequence of this arrangement, Applicant developed long-\nstanding relationships with at least one local bank. Another consequence of this\narrangement is that Applicant\u2019s business regularly reflected varying amounts of\n\n Tr. 31.\n    4\n Tr. 72.\n    5\n Id.\n    6\n Tr. 35.\n    7\n Tr. 36.\n    8\n Tr. 36-37.\n    9\n Tr. 38.\n    10\n3\noutstanding debt on one or more projects. Such running debt is typical in this particular\nindustry.  \n4\nApplicant operated his business in this manner from 1965 until the early 1990s.\nDuring that time, he was highly reliant on the banks for balancing his accounts.  It was\n5\nthe banks, not Applicant, apparently, that reconciled credit extended and income\nearned.6\nIn 1993 or 1994, an electrical fire burned down Applicant\u2019s office. All the\nbusiness\u2019 records were lost. As he endeavored to get his business back on track,\nApplicant underwent a triple by-pass operation. As an integral component of each\nproject, this invasive procedure interrupted Applicant\u2019s direct involvement in his\nbusiness. Progress on projects was slowed, but Applicant was able to continue making\ndebt service payments with the financial help of his wife. None of his creditors sued or\ninstituted foreclosure proceedings during this time. Slowly, Applicant regained his health\nand rebuilt his business.\nIn 2003, Applicant suffered a heart attack. By that time, Applicant\u2019s business\nfaced increased competition from entities located outside his hometown and region.\nThe number of his competitors grew from about five to around 25.  While business\n7\nbecame less vigorous, Applicant continued with his projects and the management of\nboth his business finances and running debt. Seeking a way to generate more income,\nApplicant received a license as a home inspector in 2006. He opened a home\ninspection business as an extension of his engineering business license.  This\n8\nextension, however, was ill timed. It coincided with the slowing of the national economy\nand a downward trend in the local real estate market.  \n9\nDespite the addition of the home inspection business, the slowing economy\nhindered Applicant\u2019s ability to stay timely on his accounts. Applicant contemplated filing\nfor bankruptcy protection. He rejected filing Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy. As a life-\nlong resident of the region, he wanted to \u201cclear up\u201d his name and honor his creditors.10\nConsequently, he and his wife chose to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in\n2007, thus invoking a more rigorous process which could ultimately lead to the\n\n Tr. 11, 38.\n    11\n Ex. A (Bankruptcy Petition).\n    12\n Tr. 41; Ex. A (Bankruptcy Petition); Exhibit B (Disclosure Statement and Plan).\n    13\n Tr. 54.\n    14\n Tr. 41.\n    15\n Tr. 54-55.\n    16\n Tr. 42.\n    17\n Ex. B (Disclosure Statement and Plan) at 6.\n    18\n4\nreorganization of his business.  As part of that process, Applicant retained an attorney\n11\nand both Applicant and his wife received financial counseling.12\nThe Chapter 11 filing is detailed. Included in the Chapter 11 package is a list of\ncreditors holding the largest unsecured claims. The completed reorganization plan\nincludes approximately $15,000 owed to Applicant\u2019s state for overdue taxes. It also\nincludes approximately $144,000 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from Form\n1040 for years 1999, 2000, and 2002.  Applicant failed to file for these periods\n13\nbecause he was \u201cdiscombobulated\u201d following his office fire and health concerns.14\nOtherwise, Applicant\u2019s taxes are current.  He stated that he ultimately filed for the\n15\nyears at issue and was making payments on both debts by the time he filed for\nbankruptcy, but he failed to provide copies of such filings.  Applicant\u2019s reorganization\n16\nplan is awaiting confirmation by the bankruptcy judge, pending Applicant\u2019s acquisition of\nemployment.  \n17\nApplicant is also in debt to two banks. He owes the first bank approximately\n$345,000 for the balance due on a promissory note. Based on his 40 year working\nrelationship with this bank, Applicant, with the approval of the bankruptcy court, has\nentered into an agreement under which he is currently making adequate protection\npayments in the amount of $1,844 per month. The proposed reorganization plan\nprovides for payment of this claim in full to this bank. \nApplicant owes a second bank approximately $241,361 for the balance due on a\npromissory note. This claim is secured by commercial property with a value exceeding\nthe balance of the claim. That property is currently generating rental income for the\nbank in accordance with the terms of the original note. The Chapter 11 plan proposes\npayments of $2,300 per month until the debt is paid. \nGeneral unsecured claims in the approximate amount of $505,410 exist for\nunpaid debts.  The proposed Chapter 11 plan would establish payments of $2,200 per\n18\nmonth for 36 months to the creditors included in this class of claims. \n\n Ex. 5 (Credit Report, dated April 9, 2008).\n    19\n Tr. 42-43.\n    20\n Tr. 46; Ex. 5 (Credit Report, dated April 9, 2008) at 7, 11.\n    21\n Tr. 46-47, 50-51.\n    22\n Ex. 5 (Credit Report, dated April 9, 2008) at 14.\n    23\n Tr. 48.\n    24\n Tr. 49-53\n    25\n Tr. 23.\n    26\n5\nNot included in the bankruptcy is a judgment against Applicant for approximately\n$8,991. The judgment was filed in Applicant\u2019s county court in June 2003.  This account\n19\nwas not noted in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy paperwork. Applicant has no recollection of the\ndebt.  Applicant does, however, acknowledge that he has had a credit card with this\n20\nentity.  Not having ever reviewed a credit report, Applicant has no basis for knowing\n21\nabout this entry except for its reference in the SOR.  No evidence was introduced\n22\nshowing what, if any, investigations were made to discern the origin of this entry on his\ncredit report after he received notice it was an issue in the SOR.\nAs well, a collection effort on behalf of a bank for an obligation of approximately\n$64,323 is not included in the bankruptcy action.  Applicant testified that his attorney\u2019s\n23\nsecretary investigated this entry and \u201cfound no record of this,\u201d  but he failed to offer\n24\nany documentary evidence of such communication or such a conclusion. There is no\nevidence of any other inquiry as to this credit report entry. It is unknown whether the\naccount was ultimately disputed with the credit reporting agency or the named\ncreditor.25\nApplicant is currently earning approximately $5,500 to $6,000 per month. His\nwife does not work. After living expenses and adequate protection payments to the one\nbank, Applicant has a net remainder of approximately $1,200. Should he be granted a\nsecurity clearance, Applicant will assume a position, earning about $115,000 per year.26\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n    27\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n    28\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n    29\n Id.\n    30\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    31\n6\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n27\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n28\n29\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n30\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n31\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n    32\n7\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Under that guideline, failure or an\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Conversely, an individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  The AG sets out several potential disqualifying conditions. \n32\nBy occupation, Applicant managed a business in which payment for a project\nwas generally tendered after Applicant\u2019s work had commenced. He used an interim line\nof credit to fund operations until actual payment was made. Consequently, he regularly\nincurred and carried debt on each project until certain progress was made. Due to ill\nhealth, increased competition, and a souring economy, however, Applicant ended up\nwith debt that he could no longer manage without resort to bankruptcy. \nCumulatively at issue in the SOR is over $1,300,000 in delinquent debt.\nApplicant\u2019s 2007 bankruptcy reorganization has been placed on hold. Payment is only\ncurrently being made to one creditor, a bank with which Applicant has a long-standing\nrelationship. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the\nburden is placed on Applicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nIn 1993 or 1994, Applicant\u2019s office burned down. All papers related to the\nbusinesses projects and accounts were lost. Shortly thereafter, Applicant received a\nmedically necessary triple by-pass. These incidents provided a double blow to\nApplicant\u2019s business, impacting both his immediate income and his ability to keep pace\nwith his running debt. A decade later, in 2005, Applicant suffered a heart attack at a\ntime when competition in his region had increased five-fold and shortly before the\nbeginning of an economic downturn. Under such circumstances, Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s business is predicated on carrying a certain amount of debt until a\nproject has been designed, developed, and under construction. When payments are\nmade on a project, any incurred debt can be satisfied and profits realized. Such a\nbusiness is not conducted without some degree of financial risk, nor is it insulated from\n\n8\neconomic forces. More importantly, the success of his business is directly linked to him,\nhis personal participation, and his reputation within the community. \nApplicant\u2019s business first faced obstacles in 1993 or 1994 with the office fire and\nhis triple by-pass surgery. A little over a decade later, increased competition, a heart\nattack, and an economic decline all contributed to the business\u2019 economic troubles.\nApplicant\u2019s business has been vulnerable to both external forces and those affecting\nApplicant, himself, on at least two occasions. Although Applicant continued to conduct\nhimself and his business ethically and in accordance with industry practices, there is\nlittle evidence that his business will be henceforth insulated from such forces in the\nfuture. Therefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply.\nWhen faced with an unwieldy amount of debt as the country faced an economic\ndownturn, Applicant solicited the aid of an attorney and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nprotection. To his credit, he chose Chapter 11 protection to help assure that his\nobligations would be honored. Applicant maintains that he is in repayment with one\nbank and states he has made agreements with regard to his taxes. He has introduced\nevidence of his Chapter 11 petition and reorganization plan. That petition, however, was\ninitiated in 2007 and no evidence of current payments toward any of his creditors was\nintroduced. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) does not apply. Similarly, although\nApplicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process, it is\npremature to determine the applicability of FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control\u201d).\nConducting a business such as that conducted by Applicant demands a\nconsiderable amount of good faith and interaction with the banks. Applicant\u2019s reputation\nin the community and decades of successful projects brought him that good faith. It is\nhis express intention to maintain his solid reputation and honor his obligations. To that\nend, Applicant\u2019s attorney has well demonstrated what efforts have been made in filing\nfor Chapter 11 bankruptcy and developing Applicant\u2019s reorganization plan. Such action\nwas originally initiated in, however, in 2007. Approval of the reorganization plan is\npresently on hold. This is troubling. Delay in seeking the bankruptcy judge\u2019s approval on\nthe reorganization plan may be tactical and, at least in part, predicated on Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a new job. This does not, however, overcome the fact that progress is\ncurrently at a relative standstill with the majority of the obligations at issue. \nSimilarly worrisome are the minimal efforts exerted to mitigate concerns\nregarding a judgement for nearly $9,000 and a collection effort for approximately\n$64,500. The burden is on Applicant in this proceeding to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate allegations established by the Government. The sum of $73,500 may seem\nminor in light of the total amount of debt at issue. Without evidence that these accounts\nwere not, at least, disputed through the credit reporting agency, however, it is hard to\n\n See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 08-08291 (App. Bd. Aug.\n    33\n26, 2008).\n9\nconclude proper diligence and appropriate judgement was exercised in addressing the\nsecurity concerns set forth in the SOR. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors.\nApplicant is a mature, educated, and articulate man with significant work experience.\nHe is a pillar of his community, both as a businessman and as a civic-minded citizen.\nThe record shows that he applies honor and integrity in both his professional and\npersonal life. It similarly shows he is highly reliant on his bankers and legal counsel.  \nApplicant\u2019s business is one which is highly vulnerable to market conditions and\nhis vigorous participation. He has twice experienced financial downturns. While he\nrecovered from professional and personal blows in the early 1990s, the current\neconomic climate was less forgiving to blows received in the 2000s. In 2007, he sought\nChapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That petition and the related reorganization plan\nhave been poised for approval by the bankruptcy judge, but have remained in limbo.\nFollowing numerous recitations by the Appeal Board, however, it has become axiomatic\nthat promises to pay in the future do not mitigate security concerns with regard to\nfinancial considerations. Such promises are not a substitute for a track record of paying\ndebts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.  \n33\nParticularly troubling was Applicant\u2019s failure to carry his burden and provide\ndocumentary evidence in several areas. For example, Applicant stated he has worked\nout agreements with regard to his state and federal taxes, but no such agreements\nwere presented. Similarly, there was no discussion of any exhibits detailing his current\npayment or debt satisfaction arrangements with the banks. Glaringly, no evidence was\nadmitted with regard to efforts undertaken to refute or dispute two of the seven\nobligations set forth in the SOR which, combined, represent nearly $75,000 in\n\n10\ndelinquent debt. There is no question that Applicant is a gentleman of integrity and\nsignificant achievement. Through such failures, however, he has failed to mitigate\nfinancial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the facts and circumstances presented by the record in this case,\nit is not clearly consistent with national security to determine Applicant eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.

Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on \nAugust 10, 2004. On December 17, 2007, she completed and signed an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 23, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was misdated February 14, 2008. \nHer answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on February 23, 2009. The case was \nassigned to me on April 2, 2009. \n \nOn April 8, 2009, Department Counsel contacted Applicant and proposed a \nhearing date of April 29, 2009. Applicant agreed conditionally to the hearing date, \npending her employer\u2019s consent. On April 13, 2009, Applicant left a telephone message \nfor Department Counsel agreeing to the April 29, 2009 hearing date. On April 20, 2009, \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing for the April 29, 2009 hearing. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. At the hearing, I discussed with \nApplicant \u00b6 E3.1.8. of the Directive, which states that an Applicant shall be notified at \nleast 15 days in advance of the time and place of an industrial security case hearing. \nApplicant acknowledged receiving actual notice of the hearing date on April 13, 2009, \nand she expressed her willingness to proceed with the hearing as scheduled. She also \nstated that she waived the 15-day notice provision of \u00b6 E3.1.8. of the Directive. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced 12 exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 12 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf and called no witnesses. She introduced 16 exhibits, which \nwere marked as Exs. A through E, and Exs. 1. a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.m, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, \nand 1.v.  All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without objection. \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business on \nMay 6, 2009, so that Applicant could, if she wished, provide additional information for \nthe record. Applicant timely filed one additional exhibit on April 30, 2009, and this exhibit \nwas marked Ex. PH-1 and admitted to the record without objection. On May 5, 2009, \nshe filed four additional exhibits, which were marked Exs. PH-2, PH-3, PH-4, and PH-5. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions, and they \nwere admitted to the record. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on May 7, \n2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 22 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.v.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted 20 of the 22 allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. through 1.m., and 1.o. through \n1.v.) She denied the SOR allegation at \u00b6 1.c., and she stated she had paid the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.n.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. She has never been married and has no dependents. \nShe completed high school and attended college full-time for two years in 2000 and \n\n \n3 \n \n \n2001. She was unemployed for approximately ten months in 2003 and 2004. She is \ncurrently employed by a federal contractor and seeks a security clearance. Her annual \nsalary is approximately $54,000. (Ex. 1; Ex. 12; Tr. 62-64, 75-77,120, 127.) \n \n \nApplicant completed an SF-86 in August 2004.  In response to questions on the \nSF-86 about her financial record, Applicant reported an unpaid judgment of $1,189, \ndating from 2001. She said she was unsure whether she owed other judgments, and \nshe reported that in the past seven years she had been over 180 days delinquent in \npaying two state student loans and two federal education loans. The loans totaled \napproximately $19,452.  (Ex. 12.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator in May 2005. She \nacknowledged that as of that time, she had made no payments on her state and federal \nstudent loans. She reported that her wages had been garnished to satisfy a judgment \nresulting from an unpaid credit card debt dating to 2001. She also provided a financial \nstatement showing that she had contracted with a credit management firm to pay her \ncreditors on her behalf in order to settle approximately $10,000 in existing debts. She \nagreed to pay the credit management firm $250 a month for 32 months to satisfy the \ndebts. Applicant paid the credit management firm for four months. She then stopped \npaying the firm because she didn\u2019t believe it was allocating enough money from her \nmonthly payments to settle her debts and satisfy her creditors.  (Ex. 11; Tr. 113-114.) \n \n \nApplicant completed an e-QIP in December 2007. In response to questions on \nthe e-QIP about her financial record, she reported that she was making monthly \npayments to a creditor on a $10,000 debt resulting from an automobile repossession in \nMarch 2005. She stated that her wages had been garnished to pay the judgment \nresulting from her credit card debt dating to 2001, and the debt had been satisfied in \n2005.  Additionally, she reported she owed $3,000 in delinquent student loans. (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nOn August 20, 2008, Applicant sent the following letter to DOHA: \n \nI . . . have joined a credit debt management company to resolve all \ndelinquent credit issues. The judgments for $12,269 and $10,685 are for \nthe same company and I have attached the garnishment paperwork for \nthat issue. The judgment for 897.00 has been paid and the payment is \nattached as well.  Also the issue for $365 has been paid as well.  All other \ndebts are being handled thru the counseling company.  Some of the debts \n[X and Y] collection agencies are out of business and are being disputed \nby my debt management representation. I am working on my credit thru \nthis agency and appreciate the opportunity to be considered for my top \nsecret clearance. I am working toward making improvements in my money \nmanagement decisions. As of October 1st I am also moving in with a friend \nto help minimize my monthly expensives [sic] to focus on paying off all my \ndebt.  Thank[s] again for your consideration in this matter. \n \n(Ex. 9.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn her response to the SOR, signed February 14, 2009, Applicant admitted 20 of \nthe 22 financial delinquencies alleged by DOHA. Attached to her answer was a \ndocument from a credit management firm, dated February 14, 2009, requesting \nverification of past due derogatory items on Applicant\u2019s credit report as a prerequisite to \nprocessing her application for a consolidated debt payment plan. In response, Applicant \nprovided a document she had filed with the creditor holding her automobile debt of over \n$18,000. In the document, dated February 20, 2009, Applicant requested a 60 day \ndeferment of her monthly payment to the automobile creditor for financial hardship.1  \n(Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. 2; Tr. 108-109.)   \n \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant acknowledged that the credit management firm did not \napprove her application for a consolidated debt payment plan because she lacked the \nfinancial resources to pay her debts, which were substantial. Applicant further reported \nthat her roommate paid her portion of their monthly rent for three months so that \nApplicant could use her rent money to pay her debts. Applicant acknowledged that she \nwill repay her roommate at a later date.  (Tr. 89, 114-115.) \n \n \nAt her hearing and in documents she filed after her hearing, Applicant provided \ninformation on the status of the debts alleged on the SOR. Her wages are being \ngarnished to satisfy the judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. As of April 17, 2009, Applicant \nowed approximately $11,010, which included a judgment principal of $9,371, attorney\u2019s \nfees of $1,534, and court costs of $105. (Ex. 1a; Tr. 36-37, 79-81.) \n \n \nOn May 5, 2009, Applicant satisfied the $394 judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n(Ex. PH-2; Ex. PH-3; Ex. PH-4; Tr. 83-84.)  \n \n \nApplicant initially denied knowledge of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. At her \nhearing, she provided documentation to show she made a $484 credit card payment to \nthe creditor identified at SOR \u00b6 1.c.  (Ex. 1c; Ex. E; Ex. PH-1; Tr. 47, 83-84.) \n \n \nApplicant provided a receipt to document that she had settled the medical debt of \n$163 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. and the medical debt of $280 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. for \n$354.70, and the creditor considered the debts satisfied in full. (Ex. 1e.) She provided a \nreceipt and a checking account transaction, dated April 29, 2009, to establish that she \nhad paid $216 to the creditor for the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Ex. 1f; Ex. PH-4; Tr. 88-\n89).    \n \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant stated she had not paid the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g.  \nand was seeking more information to identify the creditor.  She stated she had paid the \nmedical debts identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.i. on April 27, 2009. In a post-hearing \ndocument, she provided evidence she had made a combined payment of $454 to satisfy \n \n1  Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report of January 2, 2009, shows a past due amount of $1,640 on her \nautomobile loan. The past due amount on Applicant\u2019s automobile loan was not alleged on the SOR. (Ex. \n2.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe two debts and the amounts were deducted from her checking account on April 29, \n2009.  (Ex. PH-4; Tr. 90-93.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted she had defaulted on three separate debts to companies \nproviding cell phone services. One cell phone debt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j.  She \noffered documentation to corroborate her statement that she had authorized payment of \nthe debt of $250.78 on April 23, 2009.  She stated she was attempting to obtain more \ninformation on the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l., and the debt was not yet satisfied.  (Ex. 1 \nj; Tr. 93-97.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b61.m. that Applicant owed a delinquent cell phone debt of \n$201.22. She provided documentation to corroborate her statement that the debt had \nbeen satisfied by a debit card payment. Applicant provided documentation to \ncorroborate her statement that she had paid the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.n on June 27, \n2008.  (Ex. 1m; Ex. 10 at 12; Tr. 96-99.) \n \n \nApplicant owed a delinquent debt of $1,335 to a bank.  This debt, in collection \nstatus, was identified at SOR \u00b6 1.o. At her hearing, Applicant acknowledged she had an \naccount with the bank in 2005 or 2006, but she had not been able to identify the nature \nof the debt, and she had not paid it.  As a post-hearing submission, Applicant submitted \na statement, dated May 5, 2009, from the creditor stating the account had been satisfied \nin full, contingent upon clearance of her payment. She provided a payment confirmation \nnumber, which could not be corroborated by other information she supplied. (Ex. PH-2; \nEx. PH-4; Ex. PH-5; Tr. 100-103.)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged joining a recreation facility and incurring a debt, alleged \nat SOR \u00b6 1.p., for $1,234.  She stated she had settled the debt for $678 on April 23, \n2009. Her bank statement shows a payment for $676.88 to a creditor not specifically \nidentified as the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.p.  (Ex. PH-1; Tr. 103-105.) \n \n \nApplicant was responsible for a number of traffic tickets.  Three such obligations \nwere alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q., 1.r., and 1.s. Applicant provided documents to corroborate \nher statements that she had paid overdue traffic tickets.  Department Counsel stipulated \nthat she had paid the specific traffic violations alleged in the SOR.  (Ex. 1.q; Ex. 1.r; 1.s.; \nTr. 48-55.) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged a debt of $265, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.t., to a medical \nprovider. She stated she had not yet paid the debt but would do so on Friday, May 1, \n2009. She failed to provide evidence of payment in her post-hearing submissions. (Tr. \n106-107.) \n \n \nApplicant owed a debt, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.u., to an insurance company.  She \nprovided documentation to corroborate her statement that she had authorized payment \nof the debt on April 27, 2009 for $375.23, which included the original debt of $365.28, \nplus fees. (Ex. 1.u; Tr. 56-57.)   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant asserted she had paid the student loan debt indentified at SOR \u00b6 1.k. \nShe was unable to establish whether the debt was a state or federal student loan, and \nshe did not provide documentation to corroborate her statement that the debt had been \nsatisfied. Applicant also acknowledged she had owed over $9,000 in student loans to \nthe state college she last attended in 2001. This debt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.v. \nApplicant reported that her state of residence had withheld money from her state \nincome tax refunds twice to satisfy the delinquent student debts, thus reducing the \namount she owed to $5,400. In April 2009, approximately two weeks before her hearing, \nshe entered into a payment agreement to satisfy the remaining balance on her state \nstudent loan debt.  She agreed to make monthly payments of $250 for 20 months to \nsatisfy the debt. (Ex. 1.v; Tr. 57-58, 65-74.) \n \n \nApplicant inquired about credit counseling and planned to attend a credit \ncounseling course in May 2009. She had not yet filed her federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2006 and 2007. She filed her federal income tax return for tax year 2008 and \nreceived a refund of $8,000, which she used, in part, to pay her financial delinquencies. \nShe attributed her long history of financial delinquencies to poor planning, immaturity, \nand irresponsibility in her youth.  Applicant stated she had worked hard to pay her debts \nin order to qualify for a security clearance.  (Tr. 61-62, 115-120, 141-142.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt since at least \n2004 and was unable to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \n\n \n8 \n \n \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d))  \n \nApplicant=s financial delinquencies were long-standing.  When she answered the \nSOR in February 2009, she admitted 20 of the 22 financial delinquencies alleged. She \nstated she had an arrangement with a debt management company to consolidate her \ndebts and pay them over time.  At her hearing she acknowledged that, because of her \npoor credit, the debt management company had not approved her application for \nconsolidated payment of her delinquencies.   \n \nApplicant was unemployed for ten months between 2003 and 2004. She has no \ndependents, has been steadily employed since 2004, and reported an annual income of \n$54,000.  She has not yet received consumer credit counseling. In the weeks before her \nhearing, she took action to pay or settle many of her financial delinquencies. She \nprovided financial records to show she had paid or settled many of her debts. Some of \nthe funds she used were from her 2008 federal income tax refund. Other funds were \nprovided by her roommate. She acknowledged that she undertook her efforts to pay or \nsettle her debts because she did not want to lose her eligibility for a security clearance. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) do not apply to mitigate the facts in \nApplicant\u2019s case.  I also conclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part in mitigation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nwhen she was a mature adult. She was aware of her financial problems but did not \naddress them for many years, a decision that raises concerns about her judgment and \nreliability. \n \nTo her credit, Applicant has taken action, albeit recent, to address her \ndelinquencies. At her hearing, she provided documentation showing how she had paid \nor settled many of her debts. However, these actions are recent and do not demonstrate \na track record of satisfaction of debt consistently over time. Applicant was intent on \npaying or settling her long-standing financial delinquencies in the days before and after \nher hearing in order to retain eligibility for access to classified information. Even though \nshe paid or settled the majority of her debts, it is not clear that she understands her \nobligations to creditors, what brought about her long-standing financial delinquencies, or \nhow to avoid financially irresponsible conduct in the future.  She had no plan in place to \nprepare for future financial contingencies. \n \nOver the years, Applicant\u2019s failure to address her financial obligations has \nresulted in judgments, garnishments, deductions from tax refunds to pay delinquencies \nowed to a state, and delayed federal income tax filings.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this \ndecision becomes final.  If she wishes, she can produce new evidence that addresses \nthe Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.: For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h. through 1.j.: For Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. and 1.l.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m. and 1.n.: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o. and 1.p.: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q. through 1.s.: For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u. and 1.v.: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 5,\n2008. On December 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and he requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on March 12, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on March 18, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled\non April 7, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE.) 1-10, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A-L\nwhich were admitted into the record without objection. I held the record open until April\nApril 21, 2009\n\n2\n14, 2009 for any additional documents that Applicant wished to submit. Applicant\nsubmitted one document, which was marked as AE M and entered into the record\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 14, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 12, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h of the SOR. He denied allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f,\nand 1.g because these debts were either paid or duplicates of other allegations. He\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After he graduated\nfrom high school, he received an associate of arts degree in June 1997. He obtained a\nbachelor of arts degree in June 2000. He attended college on a part-time basis while\nworking and was awarded his second undergraduate degree (computer science) in\nDecember 2007. He has worked for his current employer since June 2008 (GE 1). He\nhas not held a security clearance.\nIn May 2000, Applicant\u2019s wife left her job to take care of her uncle who had a\nstroke. This created a financial hardship. Applicant\u2019s teaching salary was under\n$30,000. Applicant taught high school English until 2001. He worked as a carpenter\nafter his teaching position but was again laid off in June 2002. Applicant had always\npaid his bills and had no delinquent accounts until 2002.\nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent debts, including two judgments and credit card\nbills. The total amount of delinquent debt was approximately $10,000 (GE 3). Applicant\nadmitted that the majority of the accounts in the SOR allegations were delinquent\naccounts. He has paid or settled all of his accounts except one. He established a\npayment plan for one judgment. He also paid several debts in full that are not listed on\nthe SOR (AE A, E, J and K).\nThe debt in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a is a 2005 judgment. Applicant settled this\naccount. Since January 2009, he has made more than three payments of $210 a month.\nThe balance owed is $4,300 (Tr. 62). Applicant\u2019s plan is to pay this amount in full by\nJune 2009 through accelerated payments (AE H). \nThe debt in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b is a 2004 judgment. This judgment is the same\nas the debt in allegations 1.c and 1.g. Applicant settled this debt for $995. He made his\nfinal payment on April 6, 2009. The judgment is satisfied (AE D). \nThe debt in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d is a department store credit card account.\nApplicant settled the account for $1,043. Applicant has a payment plan and has made\n\n3\none monthly payment of $261 (AE B). He plans to accelerate the payments and pay the\naccount in full by the end of April 2009 (Tr. 72).\nThe debt in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e is a charged-off account. Applicant settled this\naccount for $514.54 (AE C). The account is paid. \nThe debt in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.f is a collection account that was settled in\nJanuary 2009 (AE I). The account is paid.\nThe debt in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.h is a collection account that was settled in\nAugust 2008 (AE F). A final payment of $2,000 was made in March 2009.\nApplicant presented documentation that several other accounts listed on his\ncredit report have been resolved. Applicant settled two debts with Capitol One Bank (AE\nA).\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $4,000. His salary has almost doubled\ncompared to his prior salary. After his monthly expenses, he has $1,530 net monthly\nremainder. He has two cars and both are fully paid. He has a budget and a savings\nplan. Applicant used his 2008 tax refund to accelerate debt payments as discussed\nabove (Tr. 82). He has no active credit cards. He is current on all his expenses (Tr. 92).\nApplicant\u2019s employer describes him as a good and dependable employee who is\nrespected by his coworkers and performs his work in a diligent manner. He is a decent\nand honorable person. He is recommended for a security clearance (AE M).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\nhad two judgments. He admits that he did not meet his financial obligations from 2002\n\n5\nuntil the present. His credit reports confirm that he had the delinquent debts. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in approximately 2002. Applicant has paid the majority of his\ndebts. He has another account in a payment plan. He has been making regular\npayments and expects the account to be paid very soon. He has doubled his salary and\nused his second degree to enter a field of employment that is lucrative and stable. He\nhas used this additional income to reduce his debts. He has reduced his delinquent debt\nand has no current debt. This potentially mitigating condition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s role as\na caretaker for her uncle impacted his ability to pay his debts. Applicant was earning a\nlower salary when he was teaching. He was unemployed for almost seven months.\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began with his unemployment. After he became gainfully\nemployed, he addressed each debt. He acted in a very responsible manner in\nidentifying and resolving the debts. I find this mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling.\nHowever, he set up a budget himself and settled or paid his debts. He presented\nevidence of financial reform and resolution of debts.  I conclude these mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\n\n6\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nApplicant is an intelligent, dependable and trustworthy employee. He provided for\nhis family despite his unemployment. He had no difficulty with his finances until his\nunemployment in 2002. He was conscientious in researching and addressing all his\ndelinquent debts as soon as he was gainfully employed. He has paid or is in the final\nstage of payment with all his delinquent debts. I considered the potentially disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this\ncase and conclude they are sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant has paid the largest debt, which totaled $22,000, three other debts, \nand is not liable for the next largest debt of $3,910. She has addressed the remaining \ndebts.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n \n \n \n1\nMarch 31, 2009\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on December 10, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \nOn December 18, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn February 12, 2009, I was assigned the case. On February 19, 2009, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on March 19, 2009. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified \non her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through Y, which were admitted into \nevidence. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On \nMarch 26, 2009, additional documents were received. There being no objection, the \nmaterial was admitted into evidence as Ex. Z. On March 26, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) \nwas received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.d of the SOR. She admitted the remaining allegations. Applicant is a 27-year-old \nsystems administrator who has worked for a defense contractor since January 2008, \nand is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1999, and divorced in August 2002. Applicant is a \nsingle mother raising two children ages 6 and 8. (Tr. 26) Applicant has never applied for \nfood stamps, Medicaid, or filed for bankruptcy. Applicant receives no child support from \nher ex-husband. While married, Applicant co-signed on her husband\u2019s student loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b, $22,407). When her ex-husband defaulted on the loan, the loan became \nher responsibility. Sallie Mae offered (Ex. A) to settle the debt for $9,850, an offer \naccepted by Applicant. (Ex. T, Z) Applicant\u2019s father paid the settlement offer and \nApplicant makes $250 monthly payments to repay her father. (Ex. B, Z) \n \n \nIn September 2001, following the divorce, Applicant returned to her home town. \n(Tr. 39) In October 2002, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband and new girlfriend rented an \napartment. The new girlfriend pretended to be Applicant and used Applicant\u2019s financial \ninformation and driver\u2019s license to secure the lease. Applicant\u2019s name was forged on the \nlease. (Tr. 40) Damage was done to the apartment during a drug raid, which resulted in \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s incarceration for five and one-half years. Applicant never lived \nin the apartment. The apartment complex is claiming $3,910 in damages. (\u00b6 1.e) At the \nsame time, her ex-husband secured phone service and incurred a $107 debt (\u00b61.g). \nApplicant never authorized this debt and has disputed it. (Tr. 44)  \n \n \nThe apartment complex debtor has never called or written Applicant. She has \ninitiated all contact with the creditor. The creditor offered to settle the matter for $2,800. \nApplicant believes it would be a waste of money to hire an attorney to sue her ex-\nhusband in an attempt to have him pay this debt. (Tr. 40) The debt was incurred seven \nyears ago in 2002. The state has a four-year statute of limitations on contracts which \nmay bar collection of the apartment damage.2 \n                                                          \n2 See Tex. Civ.

Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. of Tex., 416 \n \n \n \n2\n\n \nIn addition to the debts of concern listed in the SOR, Applicant has paid off or is \nmaking payment on ten medical bills and four other accounts. (Ex. D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, \nM, N, O, P, R, and S) She has paid approximately $25,000 in medical bills. (Tr. 50) She \npaid the expenses of both her children\u2019s birth and three additional surgeries. (Tr. 49) \nOver the years, Applicant has also paid various debts incurred by her ex-husband. (Tr. \n52)  \n \n \nApplicant has paid the Sprint bill ($80) listed in \u00b6 1.a. (Answer to SOR) and the \n$28 debt listed in \u00b6 1.f. (Ex. J) She is making payments on her electric utility bill and \ncurrently owes $251. (Ex. Q) The creditor\u2019s review of the $132 debt listed in \u00b6 1.f \nindicates there were no records and the debt was removed from her credit report. (Ex. \nC)  \n \nApplicant denies two debts $66 (\u00b6 1.c) and $1,411 (\u00b6 1.d) allegedly owed to the \nsame company, a collection firm that provides service to the healthcare industry. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) (Ex. 4) indicates the original debts \nwere medical debts. The debts do not appear on Applicant\u2019s July 2008 CBR (Ex. X) nor \non her March 2009 CBR (Ex. Y) In August 2008, Applicant called the number listed in \nthe March 2008 CBR and provided the creditor with her name, date of birth, social \nsecurity number, previous last name, and driver\u2019s license number. And no debt could be \nlocated in their system related to Applicant. (Tr. 37 \u2013 38) \n \n \nDuring 2008, Applicant\u2019s income was $43,600 from her current employer and \n$4,400 from her prior employer. (Ex. U) Applicant\u2019s monthly income is $2,538 and her \nmonthly discretionary income (gross income less expense) is $353. (Ex. W) Applicant\u2019s \ncredit score has improved from 328 to 591. (Tr. 27, 49) Currently, she is not being \ncontacted by creditors. (Tr. 53) Applicant maintains two credit cards which she pays in a \ntimely manner.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nF.Supp. 2d 497, 505-507 (W.D. Tex. 2006); Facility Ins. Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 357 F.3d \n508, 513-514 (5th Cir. 2004) (discussing statute of limitations for open or revolving accounts). Debts \nbarred by the Texas statute of limitations are legally uncollectible. However, Applicant\u2019s payments on his \ndebts have reinstated them, ending the statute of limitations defense to collection. See Stine v. Stewart, \n80 S.W.3d 586, 591, 45 Tex. Sup.J. 966 (Tex. 2002). The reduction in the magnitude and number of \ndebts that creditors can legally enforce because of the application of the Texas statute of limitations \nreduces the potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements, and the degree that a debtor is \n\u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d is also reduced. \n \n \n \n3\n\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \n \n4\n\nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant admitted all but two of the nine debts listed in the SOR. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe SOR listed nine debts totaling approximately $28,600 of which Applicant\u2019s \nex-husband was directly responsible for three debts totaling approximately $26,400. \nThe amount of debt in question unrelated to her ex-husband\u2019s actions was \napproximately $2,000. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were \ncontributed to by her being a single mother raising two children and by the illegal \n \n \n \n5\n\nactions of her ex-husband. The $3,910 apartment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and the $107 \ntelephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.g) were incurred by forging Applicant\u2019s name to these accounts. \nThe largest debt was her ex-husband\u2019s student loan, which he failed to pay. It is unlikely \nher ex-husband\u2019s illegal actions will cause her financial problems in the future. \nAdditionally, the apartment debt appears barred by the state statute of limitations and \nbecause Applicant\u2019s name was forged to the lease. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experienced both separation and divorce along with \nthe financial burden associated with each. She has paid $25,000 in medical bills for the \nbirth of her two children and for three additional surgeries. Her medical bills and \nsurgeries are conditions beyond a person\u2019s control. AG & 20(b) applies. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) it appears Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. \nUnder & 20(d), Applicant\u2019s father has paid the $22,407 student loan of Applicant\u2019s ex-\nhusband. Applicant is repaying her father. She has paid the Sprint bill, the debt listed in \nSOR & 1.f, and is repaying the electrical bill. Applicant has made a good-faith effort in \npaying these debts. AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) apply. \n \nApplicant has challenged the three remaining debts. She contacted the creditor \nfor the two debts listed in SOR & 1.c and & 1.d. The collection agency routinely collects \nfor healthcare debts. Applicant contacted the creditor, provided identifying information \nabout herself, and was told the creditor could not locate any debt owed by Applicant. \nApplicant contacted the creditor of the debt listed in SOR & 1.f, the creditor indicated \nthere were no records, and the debt was removed from her credit report. These three \ndebts do not raise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \n \n \n6\n\n \n \n \n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. Those set forth in the SOR were not \nincurred on luxuries, but were for medical treatment and student loans. \n \nThe largest debt plus three others have been paid or are being paid. Three \nadditional debts have been challenged and the creditors state there is no evidence of \nany obligation. The apartment debt was incurred by forging Applicant\u2019s name to the \nlease and is likely barred by the statute of limitations. This debt cannot be a source of \nimproper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts \nare paid\u2014it is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to \nhold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.h  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated Personal Conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nOn February 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 27, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2009. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on June 15, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled \non July 8, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nJuly 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called three witnesses, \nand submitted Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received over the Government\u2019s \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 16, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has an \nassociate\u2019s degree and requires about another year of college in order to obtain a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He is single with no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant has a medical history of treatment for anxiety and panic attacks dating \nback to about 2001, when he was in college. His family physician prescribed medication \nfor his condition in about 2001. He was never treated by a psychiatrist or psychologist. \nThe medication controlled his symptoms. He took the medication for about a year and \nthen weaned himself off the medication.2  \n \n \nApplicant enlisted in the United States Air Force in 2003, to go on active duty in \nMay 2004. He had been off medication and was symptom-free for more than a year at \nthat point. He told his recruiter about his medical history. The recruiter told him not to \nmention his medical history or he would not be permitted to enlist. He accepted the \nrecruiter\u2019s illegal advice and did not list or disclose his medical history on his \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), at the Military Entrance \nProcessing Station (MEPS), or during processing at basic training.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s symptoms returned during basic training. He sought medical attention \nand reported his medical history. He was processed and separated from the Air Force \nafter less than a month at basic training. He received an Entry Level Separation with \nUncharacterized service on the basis of Fraudulent Entry into Military Service.4 \n \n \nApplicant resumed treatment by his physician in 2005, and he went back on \nmedication. His doctor reported in 2008 that: \n \n[Applicant] has occasional problems with rapid heart rate and panic \nattacks. He is currently taking Lexapro, an antidepressant. He uses Xanax \nsparingly for panic attacks. Medical problems are well controlled. He \nshould continue to take his current medications. They are not likely to \naffect his job performance.5  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 28-29; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 18, 24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4. \n \n3 Tr. at 17-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 GE 4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant obtained his current job in 2005. He informed his company about his \nmedical and military history before he was hired. His company\u2019s chief executive officer \n(CEO) and facility security officer (FSO) testified on his behalf. He also submitted \nseveral character letters. He is described as a man of integrity, who is honest, \nforthcoming, intelligent, dedicated, reliable, hardworking, dependable, responsible, and \ntrustworthy. His witnesses are aware of his background and recommend him for a \nsecurity clearance.6  \n \n \nApplicant fully disclosed his medical and military history when he submitted his \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions in February 2008. He is aware that it was \nwrong to be untruthful about his medical history in order to enlist in the Air Force, even if \nhe was following the advice of his recruiter. He has learned from his mistakes and \nmatured. He is now completely aware of the importance of being totally honest.7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 30-41; AE A, B. \n \n7 Tr. at 17-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other credible government representative; and \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant intentionally did not disclose his medical history on his SF 86, at the \nMEPS, or during processing at basic training. He was discharged from the Air Force for \nFraudulent Entry into Military Service. All of the above disqualifying conditions have \nbeen established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant did not make a good-faith effort to correct the concealment of his \nmedical condition before being confronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable. \nHis actions were based in part upon the illegal advice of his recruiter. However, \nApplicant knew it was wrong and he did not correct the concealment at MEPS or at \nbasic training. AG \u00b6 17(b) is not applicable. Since his discharge more than five years \nago, Applicant has been completely truthful about his medical and military history. He \ninformed his employer of his background before he was hired. He now realizes the \nimportance of absolute honesty. I find that such conduct is unlikely to recur and it does \nnot cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His \ndisclosure of his background has eliminated any vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are all applicable.  \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant concealed his medical \nbackground on multiple occasions in order to enlist in the Air Force. He knew he was \nwrong to follow the illegal advice of his recruiter. Since his discharge more than five \nyears ago, he has been open and honest about his medical and military history. He fully \ninformed his employer of his background before he was hired. Applicant is highly \nregarded at his company, inspiring the CEO and FSO to testify on his behalf. He is \nremorseful for his actions and never intends to repeat that type of dishonest behavior.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Personal Conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a federal contractor, and he works as a force protection officer. Based on the APO AE mailing addresses in the FORM, Applicant has lived and worked overseas (Kuwait and Iraq) since about April 2007. Applicant is a never-married man who has no children. It appears that this is his initial application for an industrial security clearance. His employment history includes active duty military service and two periods of unemployment. He served in the U.S. Army beginning in 2001, and he completed his required active service in 2005, when he received an honorable discharge.

The record shows Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties as\nshown by 12 delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $112 to $13,673 for an\napproximate total of $26,000. He had two periods of unemployment in 2005 and\n2006\u20132007. Eight of the 12 debts are now paid or settled. The four remaining debts\namount to about $2,200, and Applicant has the ability to repay or resolve these debts in\nthe near future. The record contains sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided for\nApplicant.\n \nNovember 30, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, Paragraph E3.1.7. \n2\n The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting evidence, which\n3\nwill be identified as exhibits in this decision.  \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on February 17, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint as it detailed the\nfactual basis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations. Also, the SOR\nrecommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination to\ndeny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided on the written record.2\nOn August 7, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file\n3\nof relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and received by him on August 27,\n2009. He then had 30 days to submit a documentary response setting forth objections,\nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation. He responded within the 30-day period\nby providing a credit report, dated August 23, 2009, which is marked and admitted as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A. Also, he briefly explained that the credit report shows that many of\nthe debts are now paid and that the amount of debt had decreased. The case was\nassigned to me November 10, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a federal contractor, and he works as a\nforce protection officer. Based on the APO AE mailing addresses in the FORM,\nApplicant has lived and worked overseas (Kuwait and Iraq) since about April 2007.\nApplicant is a never-married man who has no children. It appears that this is his initial\napplication for an industrial security clearance. \nHis employment history includes active duty military service and two periods of\nunemployment. He served in the U.S. Army beginning in 2001, and he completed his\nrequired active service in 2005, when he received an honorable discharge. His\ndischarge paperwork (the DD Form 214) shows that his military education includes the\n\n Exhibit 5 at 4. \n4\n Exhibit 4. \n5\n Exhibit 5 at 3. \n6\n Most record citations are to Exhibit A, the August 2009 credit report, because it is the most recent credit\n7\nreport. \n3\nfield artillery automated tactical data system course and the combat lifesavers course.4\nThe DD Form 214 also shows that his military decorations and awards include the\nfollowing: combat patch, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal,\nNational Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global\nWar on Terrorism Service Medal, Kosovo Campaign Medal, Army Service Ribbon,\nOverseas Service Ribbon, and the NATO Medal (Kosovo). He served in Kosovo for\nabout six months during 2002. He was serving as a sergeant (pay grade E5) when he\nwas discharged in 2005. \nApplicant was unemployed after leaving the Army for about five months during\n2005. His second period of unemployment was for about eight months during\n2006\u20132007. This period of unemployment followed a job termination in July 2006, when\nhe was fired due to tardiness. His unemployment ended in April 2007, when he began\nhis current job as a force protection officer. \nIn August 2007, Applicant completed a security-clearance application in which he\nresponded to questions about his background.  In response to questions about his\n5\nfinancial record, Applicant disclosed a car repossession in March 2007, and a\ndelinquent credit card account with a balance due of about $5,000. Also, he made\nadditional comments disclosing that he knew he had other delinquent debts, but did not\nhave the names and addresses to report them, and that he was working on paying the\ndebts off.  \nIn January 2009, in response to the Agency\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant provided\na personal financial statement.  In it, he reported total net monthly income of $6,689,\n6\ntotal monthly expenses of $255, and a net monthly remainder of $6,435. His low\nmonthly expenses are likely due to his current employment overseas where employers\ncommonly provide housing and meals. Also, he listed four debts with various amounts\nand indicated no actual monthly debt payments. In the remarks section, he explained he\nwas in the process of paying his debts within the next four months; he was trying to\nmake payoffs instead of making monthly payments. \nThe current status of the debts, as alleged in the SOR, is summarized in the\nfollowing table.7\n\n Answer (Attachment 1\u20134).\n8\n4\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$169 collection account\n(utility bill).\nUnpaid\u2013Exhibit A, pages  8\u20139 of 22.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$204 collection account\n(utility bill).\nPaid\u2013Exhibit A, pages 15\u201316 of 22.\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$13,673 collection account\n(bank credit card).\nSettled for less than full amount\u2013Exhibit\nA, page 7 of 22; Answer (Attachment\n1\u20131).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$772 collection account\n(medical).\nPaid\u2013Exhibit A, page 12 of 22; Answer\n(Attachment 1\u20133).\nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013$599 collection account\n(medical).\nUnpaid\u2013Exhibit A, page 12 of 22.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013$279 collection account\n(medical). \nPaid\u2013Exhibit A, page 9 of 22; Answer\n(Attachment 1\u20132).\nSOR \u00b6 1.g\u2013$112 charged-off account\n(credit card).\nPaid\u2013Exhibit A, pages 5\u20136 of 22; Answer\n(Attachment 1\u20135). \nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013$6,363 collection account (car\nrepossession).\nSettled for less than full amount\u2013Exhibit\nA, page 5 of 22. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i\u2013$1,832 collection account\n(education loan).\nPaid\u2013Exhibit A, pages 17\u201318 of 22. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j\u2013$1,100 collection account\n(credit card).\nPaid\u2013Exhibit A, page 11 of 22.\nSOR \u00b6 1.k\u2013$613 charged-off account.\nUnresolved, but not listed on the two\ncredit reports from 2009 or the Dec. 2008\ncredit report. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l\u2013$847 charged-off account.\nUnresolved, but not listed on the two\ncredit reports from 2009 or the Dec. 2008\ncredit report. \nTo summarize the information in the table, Applicant paid or settled 8 of the 12\ndelinquent debts in the SOR. The unpaid and unresolved debts amount to about\n$2,200. In addition, Applicant presented proof of payment (a check for $1,371) that does\nnot correspond exactly to any of the debts alleged.  It might be payment for the debt in\n8\nSOR \u00b6 1.e, as the check is made payable to the collection company alleged. \n \n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n18\n5\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n9\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n10\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n11\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n12\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n13\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n14\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n15\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n16\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.17\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.18\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n19\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n21\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n22\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n23\n6\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n19\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n20\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n21\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties dating back several years. His well-established history of financial difficulties\nraises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a\n22\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The\n23\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n24\n7\nfacts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions, and it\nsuggests financial irresponsibility as well.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns:  \n24\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and two are most pertinent\nhere. First, \u00b6 20(b) of Guideline F applies in his favor based on his two periods of\nunemployment during 2005 and 2006\u20132007. Indeed, the car repossession took place\nduring the unemployment in 2007. Because the second period of unemployment\nresulted from a job termination for cause, however, the credit in mitigation is reduced.\nOtherwise, there is no evidence that Applicant acted irresponsibly under the\ncircumstances. \nSecond, \u00b6 20(d) of Guideline F applies in his favor because Applicant has made\nsubstantial progress in resolving his delinquent debts. As shown by the table above, he\npaid or settled 8 of the 12 debts thereby reducing the total indebtedness from about\n$26,000 to $2,200. Given these circumstances, I conclude Applicant initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. With his relatively high\ndisposable income (more than $6,000 monthly), he should be able to resolve the\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n25\n8\nremaining four debts for $2,200 in short order. It other words, it would be unfair and\ncontrary to common sense to say that Applicant is now overextended due to the $2,200\nin delinquent debts in light of his obvious ability to pay. It is also noteworthy that\nApplicant made this progress while deployed overseas living and working in less than\nideal conditions. His persistence to resolve his delinquent debts under these\ncircumstances speaks volumes about his seriousness of purpose and his character.\nLooking forward, based on his track record of repayment and his high disposable\nincome, it is most likely that Applicant will resolve the outstanding delinquent debts in\nthe near future and that additional financial problems will not recur. \nTo conclude, based on the record as a whole, I have no doubts or reservations\nabout Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. In reaching this conclusion, I gave\ndue consideration to the nine-factor whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable\n25\nevidence, to include his truthful disclosure of his financial problems when he completed\nhis security-clearance application as well as his record of honorable military service in\nthe post-9/11 world. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.l:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.       \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApril 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn January 20, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 5, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing eight \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 10, 2009. Applicant received \nthe FORM on February 17, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. On March 11, 2009, Applicant submitted a letter with \nadditional information.

In April 2004, he received a transplant. He and his wife \nattempted to manage their debt through the bankruptcy proceeding, but in June 2004 he \nconverted the Chapter 13 into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In the process, he surrendered \nhis home, but retained two cars. In October 2004, the court discharged delinquent \ndebts, the amount of which is not clearly articulated in the record. He worked for a \nprivate company as an insulator from May 1995 until June 2003, when his request for \ndisability became effective. While on disability, his wife earned about $17,000 annually, \nbut has not worked since 2007.  (Item 5; AE A)  \n \n \nFrom September 2005 to August 2006, Applicant attended vocational training in \norder to accommodate his physical infirmities, terminate his disability status, and \nimprove his financial situation. (AE A; Item 5 at 10) As a result of that training, he \nobtained his current position. (AE A) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated March 8, 2008, and November 13, \n2008, the SOR alleged twenty-eight delinquent debts, totaling $6,598. Twenty-two of \nthose debts are owed to medical creditors and total $3,942. On March 10, 2009, \n                                                          \n1Applicant obtained a Secret security clearance sometime in 1980, which he needed to work at a \nnaval shipyard for a federal contractor. (Item 5 at 32)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant entered into an agreement with a company to help resolve nineteen of the \ntwenty-eight outstanding debts, which total $4,579. Applicant asserted that the \nremaining eight debts (totaling $1,419) have been removed from his recent CBR, but \ndoes not indicate why. Seven of those eight debts are medical debts and are included in \nthe twenty-two debts noted previously. (AE A and B) Applicant paid the $688 state tax \nlien, listed under SOR \u00b6 1.v. (Item 6 at 5; Item 8; AE A) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to the budget he submitted in August 2008, Applicant\u2019s net monthly \nincome was $2,063 and his expenses were about $2,260, indicating a $197 monthly \ndeficit.  Since May 2007, he has managed to pay off four tax liens. (Item 7) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations are \nset out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19, two of them are potentially disqualifying: \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on two CBRs and his admissions, Applicant has been unable or unwilling \nto satisfy debts that began accruing subsequent to the discharge of other debts through \nbankruptcy in October 2004. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. The guideline \nincludes six examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and have been so, both prior to \nand subsequent to a discharge of debt through the bankruptcy court in October 2004. \nHence, AG \u00b6 2 (a) cannot apply. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are attributable to a \nthree-year period of time in which he was on disability, his wife earned a small salary, \nand he incurred large medical bills that constitute the bulk of the delinquent debts. \nThose conditions were beyond his control. However, there is no evidence in the record \nindicating that he responsibly attempted to manage his finances during those difficult \nperiods, which is necessary for full application of this mitigating condition. Thus, AG & \n20(b) has limited application. Applicant did not present any evidence that he received \ncredit counseling. Recently, he hired a firm to begin resolving 19 of the 28 delinquent \ndebts, which actions warrants some mitigation under AG & 20(c). Applicant has paid the \noutstanding $688 tax lien, such that AG & 20(d) applies to that debt. There is no \nevidence indicating that he disputed any of the debts, which is required for the \napplication of AG & 20(e). The record does not support the application of AG & 20(f).  \n  \n Whole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n6 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 52-years old and \nrecently began working for a federal contractor. Prior to this position, he worked for a \nprivate company for about eight years before becoming disabled due to kidney failure. \nAs a consequence of his serious medical condition, he was on disability for three years, \nwhile his wife earned a minimal salary. Those circumstances clearly contributed to his \nbankruptcy and later financial problems. Initially, he attempted to manage his debts \nthrough a Chapter 13, but within three years converted it into a Chapter 7 when he \ncould no longer maintain the payments. I also considered the Government\u2019s concerns \nover Applicant\u2019s outstanding delinquent debt that now totals about $6,000 and accrued \nsince his October 2004 bankruptcy discharge. While I appreciate the significance of that \nconcern, I recognize that Applicant sought to improve his financial situation by attending \nvocational school for a year between 2005 and 2006 while on disability. Given his initial \nattempt to pay his debts through a Chapter 13 and the subsequent completion of \nvocational training, I find that he previously demonstrated a determination to responsibly \nmanage his financial delinquencies. Although he entered into an agreement to resolve \nhis debts very recently, there is no other derogatory information in the record that leads \nme to conclude that he will not follow through with the resolution of his debts (most of \nwhich are medical) and jeopardize his employment.   \n \n  Overall, the record evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.cc:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nSeptember 28, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \naffirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn March 19, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG). In his Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on April 10, 2009, Applicant \nadmitted all allegations under Guideline F, except for allegations 1.c., 1.d., 1.g., and 1.j. \nApplicant also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 17, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on June 22, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 2, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 23, 2009. During the hearing, \nthe government offered four exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant had attached nine documents to his \nanswer to the SOR; for administrative convenience, I marked them as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through I. At the hearing, Applicant offered his own testimony and that \nof one witness. He also offered six exhibits, which were marked as AE J through O, and \nadmitted without objection. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation. Department Counsel forwarded without objection Applicant\u2019s timely \nsubmission of three additional documents. I admitted the additional documents as AE P \nthrough R. DOHA received the transcript on July 30, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the \npleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record evidence, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 47 years old, has been married for 13 years. He has two daughters, \naged 21 and 23. His 12-year-old son resides with Applicant and his wife. He is a field \nengineer and has been employed by the same defense contractor since 2000. He has \nbeen taking college courses since March 2008, and will complete credits for his \nassociate\u2019s degree in February 2010. His company pays for his tuition and expenses. \nHe hopes to move ahead in his company once he completes his degree. He has not \nbeen unemployed in the past ten years. This is his first application for a security \nclearance (GE 1; Tr. 30-32, 39, 67). \n \nApplicant was born in a southern city (A) and worked there for most of his life. He \nbegan working for defense contractor B in that city in 2000. In November 2005, his \n\n \n \n3 \nemployer informed him of pending job cuts. Although the company could no longer \nemploy him in city A, his supervisor appreciated his skills, and offered him a position in \nanother city (B). Despite having just purchased a house in city A, Applicant and his wife \ndecided he needed to stay employed, and they moved the family to city B in early 2006. \nApplicant's spouse was unemployed for several weeks after their move. City B had a \nhigher cost of living, and Applicant had to pay for housing there as well as the mortgage \npayment on the house he had purchased in city A. Most of Applicant's bills started to \nbecome delinquent after the move, and he struggled financially for about one year. He \ndid not avoid his creditors, but talked with them and explained that he was unable to \nafford the settlements or large payments they required (GE 1, 3, 4; Tr. 32-36, 93). \n \nApplicant considered renting his house in city A, but the standard rental rate \nwould not have covered Applicant's expenses, such as the cost of the property \nmanager. When he was having trouble paying his mortgage on the house in city A, \nApplicant stayed in touch with the mortgage lender. The company worked with Applicant \nand he was allowed to make half-payments. The company eventually allowed Applicant \nto do a short sale, and Applicant was able to sell the house in 2007 (GE 2 [letter dated \nMay 22, 2007]; Tr. 37-39). \n \nApplicant sought out consumer credit counseling, but was told that his debts \nwere too substantial. He also investigated filing for bankruptcy, and spoke with an \nattorney. He decided against it because he felt that the negative effect of bankruptcy on \nhis financial record would be significant. He talked with two banks about obtaining a \nconsolidation loan, but he did not qualify at that time (Tr. 35-37). \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR total approximately $77,000. Applicant and his wife \nearn a net monthly income of approximately $4,487, which equals a net annual income \nof approximately $54,000. After paying expenses of $2,640 and debt payments of \n$1,487 (including the payment on his wife\u2019s 2009 car), Applicant has about $360 net \nmonthly remainder. He did not separately list his payments for child support arrears \nunder monthly debts because the $200 per month is automatically deducted from his \npaycheck (GE 2; Tr. 40-43). \n \nApplicant's wife has worked as a security guard for a defense contractor since \n2006. When she applied for a security clearance, questions were raised as to their \ndebts, but she was approved and has held a security clearance for approximately one \nyear. She testified that their financial problems began when they moved to city B, while \nstill paying a mortgage in city A. She noted that they have worked to bring their debts \nback to a current status, and their credit score is improving. She purchased a 2009 car \nin her own name and has made all payments timely. (Tr. 93-99) \n \n \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges 11 debts. The current status of the alleged \ndebts follows. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n                                                \n$ \nCredit card - $1,289 (allegation 1.a.): Payment plan. Applicant had difficulty \ndetermining what company held this account. When he reached the correct \nagency, he established a plan of $50 per month and had made two payments as \nof the date of the hearing (GE 3, 4; AE K; Tr. 55-57).  \n \n$ \nCredit cards - $671 (allegation 1.b.) and $271 (allegation 1.c.): Payment plan. \nApplicant believes allegation 1.c. may be a duplicate of 1.b. In 2003 or 2004, he \nwas able to consolidate several credit card balances, including 1.b., with the \ncreditor listed in 1.e. That creditor sold the account to the creditor shown in AE \nJ. However, the credit bureau reports mistakenly list the original credit card \nbalances as still delinquent. The outstanding balance on the account is $13,567. \nHe was paying $125 per month when he was in city A. He is now paying $60 per \nmonth and hoping to obtain a settlement in the future (GE 4; AE F, J; Tr. 58-62, \n64-68). \n \n$ \nFinance - $1,337 (allegation 1.d) and $8,452 (allegation 1.e.): Payment plan \n(allegation 1.e.). He was offered a settlement amount of $5,000 but was unable \nto make a lump-sum payment. He established a payment plan and provided \nevidence that he is making payments according to the plan at a rate of $150 per \nmonth, automatically deducted from his checking account. Applicant does not \nrecognize the debt in 1.d. (GE 3, 4; AE C, M; Tr. 52-55, 69-71). \n \n$ \nChild support - $38,824 (allegation 1.f.): Automatic deduction. Applicant \noriginally paid both child support and arrears. AE D and N show the amounts \ndeducted for child support and arrears between 2003 and 2007. As of April \n2007, Applicant owes only arrears. His monthly payments of $200 are deducted \ndirectly from his paycheck. Between 1997 and 2009, he paid a total of $30,220 \n(GE 3, 4; AE D, N; Tr. 44, 48-52). \n \n$ \nAutomobile loan - $23,475 (allegation 1.g.): Paid. Applicant obtained a \nsettlement offer from the creditor for $4,695. Applicant paid the amount in full in \nMarch 2009 (GE 3, 4; AE E, L; Tr. 26, 52).  \n$ \nSecured loan - $210 (allegation 1.h.): Unpaid. This debt is a loan Applicant \nobtained when he operated a small computer business in city A. He is willing to \npay the debt, but has been unable to locate the creditor (GE 3, 4; Tr. 62-63).  \n \n$ \nCredit cards - $778 (allegation 1.i.) and $584 (allegation 1.j.): Paid; Payment \nplan. Applicant provided documentation that he paid the debt alleged at 1.i. in \nOctober 2008. Allegation 1.j. is included in the consolidation plan discussed \nunder allegation 1.b., above  (GE 3; AE A)1  \n \n1 The debts in allegations 1.i. and 1.j. are owed to the same creditor. Applicant testified that 1.i. was \nincluded in the consolidation plan and 1.j. is paid. However, AE A shows that 1.i. is paid. I find Applicant \nconfused the debts to the same creditor, and it is allegation 1.j. that is included in the consolidation plan. \n\n \n \n5 \n                                                \n \n$ \nCredit card - $1,210 (allegation 1.k.): Unpaid. Applicant was paying on it timely \nwhen he lived in city A. He had trouble maintaining the payments after he \nmoved to city B. Once he was financially able to resume payments, he could not \nlocate the current holder of the account (GE 3; Tr. 74-77). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Decisions must reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nthe Financial Considerations Guideline.   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest3 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.4 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or her own.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n5 See Egan at 531; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                           \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \nAG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. Applicant has \nnumerous debts, most of which became delinquent between 2006 and 2007. He was \nunable to pay them because of limited resources after a move to a city with a high cost \nof living. The record contains no evidence of other disqualifying conditions such as \ndebts related to alcoholism, gambling or deceptive practices.  \n \n \nThe Financial Considerations Guideline (AG \u00b6 20) also contains factors that can \nmitigate security concerns. The following mitigating conditions are relevant: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nAfter Applicant's employer in his home state decided to downsize, Applicant \naccepted the offer of a position in another city. Between 2006 and 2008, he was paying \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \nthe mortgage on his home in city A, while paying rent and living expenses in city B. The \ncompany\u2019s downsizing was an unexpected event that Applicant could not control. He \nunfortunately purchased a home about the same time, not knowing that he would be \nlosing his position. He could not anticipate that he would need to move to an expensive \narea in order to retain his job. He acted reasonably by consulting with a consumer \ncounseling agency, discussing his options with an attorney--including bankruptcy--\nkeeping in touch with his creditors, and seeking to establish payment plans. AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies. \n \nOnce Applicant became financially able to work on his debts, he made \npersistent efforts to bring his financial situation under control. Applicant paid several \ndebts and established payment plans for others. The relatively small amount \noutstanding on two unpaid debts is not enough to raise a security concern. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation is under control and his conduct shows a good-faith effort to resolve \nhis delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(c) and (d) apply. I find for Applicant on Guideline F. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nspplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the spplicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the Guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nGuideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant accrued a substantial amount of delinquent debt over the past several \nyears. His financial problems resulted from a combination of factors including his \ncompany\u2019s downsizing, a home purchase that occurred at the time of the downsizing, \nand a move to a more expensive area in order to keep his job. His inability to pay his \ndebts resulted from factors that he could not control or anticipate. However, Applicant \nkept in touch with the creditors, established payment plans when he could, and paid off \nseveral debts. His efforts show that his debts resulted not from any desire to avoid his \n\n \n \n8 \nobligations, but from lack of funds. Applicant acted in a mature and responsible \nfashion. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to have \npaid every debt in the SOR, but must show that he has established a plan and has \ntaken actions to implement the plan.6 Applicant\u2019s efforts demonstrate a sincere intent \nto meet his financial obligations. A fair and commonsense assessment of the available \ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has \nsatisfied the doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s \ninterests. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRITA C.

On October 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 25, 2008, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s written case on December 1, 2008.  Applicant received a complete\n1\nfile of relevant material (FORM) on December 29, 2008, and was provided the\nFebruary 13, 2009\n\n2\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Applicant did not submit additional information. The case was\nassigned to me on February 10, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 7, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6 1.a through 1.g of the SOR (Item 3). He did not provide\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school, and received an Associate Degree in May 1996. Applicant served in the\nU.S. Air Force from August 1968 until March 1972. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard\nfrom April 1974 until March 1978. He held a secret clearance while in the military. He is\ndivorced and has no children. He has worked for his current employer since February\n2008 (Item 4). \nApplicant worked as a computer lab specialist from May 1996 until June 2004\n(Item 4). He reports that he worked as a general laborer after June 2004 until October\n2007. From October 2007 until February 2008, Applicant was unemployed (Item 4).   \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling approximately $84,500 (Item, 5, 6,\n7 and 8). The accounts were charged-off or in collection from approximately 2003.\nApplicant admitted that the account in allegations \u00b6 1.a through 1.g were\ndelinquent accounts and gave the reason as he was unable to arrange payments due to\nunemployment from June 2004 (Item 3). He does not intend to file for bankruptcy.\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: the collection\ndebts and charged off accounts from late 2003 until the present are delinquent and not\npaid. Applicant did not report receiving financial counseling.\nApplicant\u2019s answer explains that he does not live in the lap of luxury and paid his\ntaxes until 2005. He emphasized that he has no criminal background and two honorable\ndischarges. He stated that not having a \u201cgood paying job\u201d did not allow him to pay his\ncreditors. He did not provide any documentation to support his position concerning the\ndebts alleged.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $0. He reported monthly expenses of\n$30 a month. He did not list any payments for any debts. His net remainder is listed as-\n$30 (Item7).\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n4\n \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19\u00a9, Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts\ntotaling approximately $84,500. He admitted to the delinquent debts. He has not met his\nfinancial obligations from 2003 until the present time. His credit reports confirm his\ndebts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in approximately late 2003. He accumulated delinquent debt due\nto an inability to pay his expenses while not employed. While those circumstances may\nhave precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. He has not acted\nresponsibly. His conduct over the last six months with his creditors does not remove\nsecurity concerns or doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment. He has approximately $84,500 in delinquent debt. This potentially mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported a period of unemployment in his answer to the FORM. He listed\nlaborer positions in his security clearance for the period of 2004 until 2007. Although\nApplicant\u2019s situation may have started due to no employment and may have initially\nstarted a downturn for him, he did not provide any explanation as to how this impacted\n\n5\nhis ability to pay his debts. He did not provide any information that he acted responsibly\nin identifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition does\nnot apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. He provided little or no\ninformation. His promises to pay in the future when he obtains \u201csuitable employment\u201d do\nnot constitute evidence of financial reform or resolution of debts. His efforts are not\nsufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant did not dispute any of\nthe debts. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2\u00a9, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant reports unemployment The record contains\nscant information concerning Applicant. He chose to have his case decided on the\nwritten record. His answer to the SOR and lack of submissions to the FORM are not\nsufficient for him to meet the burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n6\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the\nApplicant on May 19, 2009.  The Applicant received the FORM on June 2, 2009, and\nwas given 30 days to submit any additional information.  He elected not to submit\nanything further.  The case was assigned to me on August 5, 2009.  Based upon a\n\n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 50 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs.  The Applicant admitted all of the\nallegations under this paragraph in the SOR.  These admissions are hereby deemed\nfindings of fact.\nThe Applicant has held a Department of Defense security clearance since\nJanuary 23, 2003. (Item 10.) The Applicant admits he used cocaine at least three times\nbetween May and August 2007. In an unsworn declaration regarding interviews taken\nbetween January 22 to January 26, 2008, it was stated, \u201c[The Applicant] could not recall\nthe exact number of times he used the cocaine and believes it might have been as\nmany as ten times.\u201d (Item 7 at 5.) The Applicant maintains that he stopped using\ncocaine in August 2007, and has no intention of using cocaine or any other illegal drug\nin the future. (Item 7 at 6.)\nMs. A has been the Applicant\u2019s roommate since January 2006. From January\n2006 until May 2007, when he began using cocaine with her, the Applicant often\nwitnessed Ms. A use cocaine in his house. (Item 7 at 6.) The Applicant spent at least\n$2,000 on cocaine during the four-month period when he was using cocaine with Ms. A.\nThe cocaine was bought by Ms. A, using money given to her by the Applicant. As of\nJanuary 2008, she continued to live in the Applicant\u2019s house with him. (Item 7 at 7-8.)\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nis financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. The Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this paragraph.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  \n2.a.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a bank on a credit card account\nin the amount of $6,864. (Item 6 at 10; Item 8 at 1; Item 9 at 5.) This debt has not been\npaid.\n2.b.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted on a credit card account in the\namount of $5,841. (Item 8 at 1; Item 9 at 5.) This debt has not been paid.\n\n3\n2.c.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted on a second credit card account in\nthe amount  of $7,839. (Item 6 at 10; Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 2.) This debt has not been\npaid.\n2.d.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a department store in the\namount of $241.  (Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 15.) This debt has not been paid.\n2.e.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a third bank on a credit card\naccount in the amount of $2,471. (Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 3.) This debt has not been paid.\n2.f.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a telephone company in the\namount of $132.  (Item 8 at 2.) This debt has not been paid.\n2.g.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency for defaulted\nstudent loans in the amount of $33,652.  (Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5.) The\nApplicant made a payment arrangement with the collection agency for his student loan\ndebts. As of September 2008, he was paying $250 a month towards this debt. (Item 6 at\n8.) He submitted no evidence showing that this debt is continuing to be paid in a timely\nfashion. This debt has not been paid.\nThe Applicant admits that his financial situation was due, in part, to his purchases\nof cocaine in 2007. In addition, the Applicant gave Ms. A access to his bank account\nand one of his credit cards, which she used excessively. (Item 7 at 8.) The Applicant\nalso admits that, as of January 2008, he did not have the money to pay his creditors.\n(Item 7 at 10.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\n\n5\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25\nand find that the following conditions apply given the facts in this case.  AG \u00b6 25(a),\n\u201cany drug abuse; AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and\nAG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d\nThe Applicant used cocaine at least three times, and possibly about ten times, in\nthe two years preceeding the record closing in this case. He provided the money and\nhad his roommate, also a drug user, buy the drugs for him. During the entire time he\nwas using drugs, he had a security clearance and knew that using drugs was wrong. All\nof the above disqualifying conditions apply to the facts in this case. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6\n26 and find that none of them apply to the facts in this case concerning Applicant\u2019s\ncocaine use.  AG \u00b6 26(a) states that it may be mitigating where \u201cthe behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent or happened under circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d The Applicant\u2019s drug abuse was of short duration, but obviously intense\nduring that period. As stated, it ended less than two years before the record in this case\nclosed. I find that, under the facts of this case, it is still too soon for this condition to\napply.\nFurther, under AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where an applicant has \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement\nof intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d The Applicant\ncontinues to live with Ms. A, who was a major contributing factor to this situation. He\nsubmitted no signed statement concerning an automatic revocation of his clearance,\nwhich would be mitigating. Finally, his period of abstinence, in this particular case, is\ninsufficient. Paragraph 1 is found against the Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. AG\n\u00b6 19(b) states that \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt\u201d is of security concern.  Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Finally, under AG \u00b6 19(f), it\nmay be disqualifying if the Applicant has \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to drug\nabuse, alcoholism, gambling problems, or other issues of security concern.\u201d The\nApplicant, by his own admission, has over $57,000 in past due debts, all of which have\nbeen due and owing for several years. He has revealed to the Government no plan to\npay off these debts. Indeed, in his Answer, he states at page three, \u201cOnly time will allow\nme to correct the financial problems that I have at this time.\u201d In addition, by his own\nadmission, much of this occurred because of the drug habit he had in 2007. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily after 2007.  He submitted evidence showing that he\nhas a payment plan concerning his student loans, but has not submitted any evidence\nshowing that he has paid any of the other debts. The fact that the rest of the debts have\nbeen due and owing for so long is troubling. This mitigating condition is not applicable to\nthis case. \nThe Applicant submitted no evidence showing that AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable. That\ncondition states it may be mitigating where, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nThe Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors. There is\nno track record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly, AG\n\u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. Finally, given the fact that he is approximately $57,000 in debt,\nI cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nBased on all of the available evidence, I cannot find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the allegations under this Guideline.  Paragraph 2 is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\n\n7\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making such a determination:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is a mature man who\nused cocaine, an illegal substance, in the recent past. He spent at least $2,000 on the\ndrug, lives with the person who introduced him to the drug, and has serious financial\ndifficulties because of his drug use. In viewing all the facts of this case, I cannot find that\nthe Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct. As set forth\nabove, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6). In addition, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is a likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Applicant is 43 years of age and has a Bachelor Of Science Degree in Architectural Engineering from a University in Iraq. He is employed as a Bi-cultural/Bilingual Advisor for a defense contractor. He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Iraq in 1966. He grew up in Iraq, as a Kurd. He was drafted and served four months in the mandatory Iraqi military before leaving to save his life, and because he did not believe in the war. From 1994 to October 1996, he worked for an American based company in Iraq. In 1996, the government of Iraq attacked the city and the company the Applicant worked for. At that point, the Iraqi government considered the Applicant to be a spy for the United States. With the help of the United States company, the Applicant fled the country in 1996. In 1997, the Applicant came to the United States with his wife and infant daughter, and made it their permanent home. He quickly merged into the American culture and society.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Attorney At Law\nJanuary 25, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire For Investigations Processing\non October 27, 2005.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On March 24, 2009, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on May 12, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on July 8, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 13, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for August 19, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented\nfour exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 4.  The Applicant called two\nwitnesses and presented twenty-three exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough W.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non August 26, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n\n2\nREQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Iraq.  After being assured\nthat the only information to be considered in the documentation was that concerning the\ncountry of Iraq, Applicant had no objection.  (Tr. p. 22).  The request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 43 years of age and has a Bachelor Of\nScience Degree in Architectural Engineering from a University in Iraq.  He is employed\nas a Bi-cultural/Bilingual Advisor for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Iraq in 1966.  He grew up in Iraq, as a Kurd. He was\ndrafted and served four months in the mandatory Iraqi military before leaving to save his\nlife, and because he did not believe in the war.  From 1994 to October 1996, he worked\nfor an American based company in Iraq.  In 1996, the government of Iraq attacked the\ncity and the company the Applicant worked for.  At that point, the Iraqi government\nconsidered the Applicant to be a spy for the United States.  With the help of the United\nStates company, the Applicant fled the country in 1996.  \nIn 1997, the Applicant came to the United States with his wife and infant\ndaughter, and made it their permanent home.  He quickly merged into the American\nculture and society.  He became a naturalized United States citizen in 2005.  His wife,\nbecame a naturalized United States citizen in 2006, and they now have three children\nwho are United States citizens, two of whom were born here.  \nThe Applicant has a number of family members who remain in Iraq.  His elderly\nmother is a citizen and resident of Iraq.  He contacts her by telephone approximately\nonce every three or four months to see how she is doing.  He also has three brothers\nand three sisters who are residents and citizens of Iraq.  He contacts his brothers about\nthree times a year to ask about their families.  Two of his brothers he has not seen since\n1999 when he returned to Iraq for three weeks, following his father\u2019s death.  The\nremaining brother he saw with permission, during an official mission in 2006.  The\nApplicant contacts his sisters in Iraq about once a year.  He last saw his sisters in Iraq\nin 1999.  The only member of his family that works for the government is his middle\nsister.  She works for a hospital in Iraq, as all hospitals are run by the government.\nNone of his family have asked him any questions about his job in the United States.  \n\n3\nThe Applicant has a mother and father-in-law who are retired residents and\ncitizens of Iraq.  He has a sister and brother-in- law who are also residents and citizens\nof Iraq.  He does not communicate with them at all, and last saw them in 1999.  The\nApplicant fully understands that the interests of the United States come first, even if his\nfamily in Iraq were jeopardized.  (Tr. p. 80).   \nIn October 2005, the Applicant started working for his current employer.  His job\nis based in Iraq on a United States military base.  He reports on a daily basis to high\nranking military officers and understands his important responsibilities to the United\nStates.  The Applicant has never been approached by anyone questioning his job or\nany situation or information adverse to the United States, or that would otherwise place\nthe security of the United States in jeopardy.  If he ever were approached in that\nmanner, he states that he would immediately report it to his superiors.  He currently\nowns two houses in the United States, a checking and savings account, and a 401(k)\ninvestment account.  \nThe Applicant has no assets of any kind in Iraq. Applicant supports no political\norganizations and does not vote in Iraq.  He states that he, his wife or children will never\nreturn to Iraq to live.\nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  One, a past coworker and\nfriend, testified that he and his family regularly socialized with the Applicant and his\nfamily.  The other, a past employer and friend, testified that he considers the Applicant\nto be a man of excellent character.  \nNumerous letters of recommendation from various high ranking military officers,\nand diplomats, with whom the Applicant has worked, or is currently working, reflect all\nvery positive recommendations for security clearance.  The Applicant is said to have the\nskills, perspective, intelligence and experience that have allowed him to successfully\nfulfill the requirements of a delicate job that necessitates an understanding of security\nconcerns and the protection of sensitive information.  Working under the highest threat\nof attack and espionage, the Applicant is trusted by these individuals to defend and\nprotect the interests of the United States.  He is considered a consistent good worker,\nable to deal effectively with multiple complex tasks often under significant time\nconstraints and pressure.  He pays appropriate attention to detail, and takes pride in the\nquality of his work.  Each of the individuals who have submitted letters on the\nApplicant\u2019s behalf have full faith in the Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, ethics, loyalty and\ncommitment to the interests of the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I).\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations from April 206 through January 2009\nindicate that he consistently exceeds work requirements in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits J through O).  \nApplicant has received Certificates of Appreciation for outstanding work for the\nUnited States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits P, Q, U and V). \nApplicant has completed specialized training courses in his field to assist the\nUnited States in its mission.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits R and S).\n\n4\nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Iraq.  With regard\nto Iraq, in 2003, a United States led coalition removed Saddam Hussein and his\nBa\u2019athist regime from power.  In March 2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office after\nbeing freely elected by the Iraqi people.  However, violence continues to engulf the\ncountry.  This violence has been fueled and perpetrated by Al Qaida terrorists, Sunni\ninsurgents, and Shiite militias and death squads.  The State Department has specifically\nstated that: \u201cThe risk of terrorism directed against United States citizens and interests in\nIraq remains extremely high\u201d.  Furthermore, the State Department has posted the\nfollowing warning: \u201cAttacks against military and civilian targets through Iraq continue,\nincluding in the International (or \u201cGreen\u201d) Zone.  Targets include hotels, restaurants,\npolice stations, checkpoints, foreign diplomatic missions, and international organizations\nand other locations with expatriate personnel. Such attacks can occur at any time.\u201d\nKidnapings still occur: the most recent kidnaping of an American citizen occurred in\nAugust 2007.  There are United States substantiated reports of human rights abuses,\nincluding a \u201cpervasive climate of violence; misappropriation of official authority by\nsectarian, criminal and insurgent groups; arbitrary deprivation of life; disappearances;\ntorture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d    \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\n\n5\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion; \n7.  (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information.  \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\n8.  (d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are\napproved by the cognizant security authority.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \n\n6\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a susceptibility to foreign influence and has\nforeign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign\npassport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to\nplace the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The\nGovernment must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance\nholder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\n\n7\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion and, 7(b)\nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information applies.  \n  \nHowever, the Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the\nfollowing Mitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular\nbackground:  Mitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S., 8(b) There is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest, 8(c) Contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation, and 8(d) the\nforeign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are approved by the\ncognizant security authority also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant has foreign family members who are residents and\ncitizens of Iraq, the Applicant is not close to them, and now has very little contact with\nthem whatsoever.  There is no evidence of a close bond or strong evidence of affection.\nThe Applicant\u2019s deep and abiding ties are here in the United States.  His immediate\nfamily reside in the United States.  All of his financial assets are in the United States.\nHe is an American citizen.  For the past thirteen years he has worked hard to establish\nhimself as a responsible, trustworthy, professional and loyal American citizen.  His wife\nand children are all citizens and residents of the United States.  His unique employment\nwith the DOD, his assets, which include his homes, bank and retirement accounts are\nall in the United States.  The Applicant has essentially cut all ties from Iraq when he\nmoved to the United States and made it his permanent home for the past thirteen years.\nHis relationship with his family in Iraq, tenuous though it is, does create a\nheightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists in the\nMiddle East seek intelligence and are hostile to the United States\u2019 interests.  Iraq is not\nsafe places for anyone, that much is true.  It is a war zone.  However, there is\nsubstantial evidence that the Applicant behaved in a courageous and honorable way\nduring his tour of duty in Iraq.  Officers and diplomats from the military have submitted\nglowing written statements discussing the Applicant\u2019s activities in Iraq, his strong sense\nof integrity, and specifically his ability to safeguard classified information in a combat\narea.\n\n8\n  Applicant established application of Mitigating Conditions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and\n8(d).  Based on his relationships and depth of loyalty to the United States, he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.  He has\nlived in the United States since 1978 until his employment with the Department of\nDefense in 2003.  The Applicant has been a naturalized American citizens since 2005.\nHis wife is a naturalized citizen and his children are native born Americans.  He owns a\ntwo houses in the United States and has no financial interests of any kind in Iraq.  He\nhas limited contact with his family members living in Iraq, and there is no evidence that\nhe has connections or contact with anyone over there other than his family members.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the facts set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a whole,\nsupport a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability,\ncandor, and a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Iraq elevates the cause for concern\nin this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond or affection\nwith any foreign country, or to any foreign individual, or to any foreign Government, in\nany way that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion against the interests of the\nUnited States.  Therefore, there is no possibility of foreign influence that exists that\ncould create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly,\nI find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.e.: For the Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

On June 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 15, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on September 2, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 19,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for November 19, 2009.  The Applicant requested that the\nvenue be changed from Hawaii to Woodland Hills, California.  The case was then\nrescheduled and set for November 10, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented\n\n2\nfour exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 4, which were admitted without\nobjection.  The Applicant presented twenty-one exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through U, which were admitted without objection.  The Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on November 19, 2009.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 35 years old and has a Master\u2019s Degree in Business\nAdministration with an emphasis in Finance.   He is employed by a defense contractor\nas a Program Manager and Consultant, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant admitted to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, with some\nqualifications.  From 1995 to 2004, the Applicant served on active duty in the United\nStates Navy.  After separating from the military in 2004, he began working as a\nconsultant for a defense contractor.  He is currently assigned overseas.  He has held a\nsecurity clearance for the past eleven years and has never been cited or charged with\nany security violation.  In 2005, he enrolled in a graduate program and obtained his\nMaster\u2019s Degree in Business Administration in 2007.  \nHis history of excessive alcohol abuse to the point of intoxication has continued\noff and on from February 2000, until at least December 2005.  He described his regular\ndrinking pattern during this period, on average, as once or twice a week, one to four\nbeverages, preferably beer or vodka tonic, mostly on the weekends until 2005.  During\nthis period of excessive drinking, the Applicant was charged, arrested and convicted of\nthree alcohol related offenses, among other misconduct.  The following facts outline\neach arrest.\n \nOn February 27, 2000, the Applicant was charged with (1) Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol, and (2) DUI with a Blood Alcohol Level of .08 or more (.13).  The\nApplicant explained that he had just returned from a six month overseas deployment to\nthe States.  He went to a friend\u2019s house with acquaintances from the military and from\ncollege where he consumed eight to ten beers over a three to four hour period.  On his\nway home, he was pulled over for speeding, and the officer detected alcohol on the\nApplicant\u2019s breath.  (Tr. p. 45.)  The Applicant was administered a field sobriety test and\narrested.  Applicant was held in jail for about eight hours and then released on his own\nrecognizance.  He pled no contest to Count 2 and Count 1 was dismissed.  He was\n\n3\nsentenced to summary probation, with a 180 day jail sentence that was suspended for\nfive years.  He was fined about $1,250.00 and ordered to attend substance abuse\nclasses.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year.  Applicant stated that he\nattended substance abuse classes, one to two courses per month for two to three\nmonths between March and May 2000.  (Government Exhibit 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s second arrest occurred on June 15, 2003, while assigned overseas.\nHe was charged with violating Article III (Drunken Driving) and Article 92 (Failure to\nObey a Lawful Order and Failure to Identify) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nApplicant explained that he had met his girlfriend for dinner and then consumed four\ncocktails.  On his way home he was stopped at a check point and the police smelled\nalcohol on the Applicant\u2019s breath.  The Applicant did not have his identification or\ndriver\u2019s license with him at the time.  He refused to make any statement or admit fault\nwithout a lawyer present, so he requested an attorney.  The authorities misunderstood\nthe Applicant\u2019s request and thought he had misidentified himself.  The authorities drove\nto the Applicant\u2019s house to get his identification, and then arrested him.  He was then\nturned over to the military police.  The Applicant received non-judicial punishment and\nwas found to be in violation of Article 107 (False Official Statement) and Article 133\n(Manner Unbecoming an Officer) of the UCMJ.  He was not found culpable of Drunken\nDriving.  Applicant was verbally reprimanded and degraded.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  \nOn December 6, 2005, the Applicant was again arrested while overseas.  He was\ncharged with Prohibition of Drunken Driving (a violation of Korean traffic laws), with\nOperating a Vehicle with a Suspended License and Failure to Obey Law Enforcement\nPersonnel (violations of U.S. Forces Korea regulations).  The Applicant explained that\nhe was at a wine bar with a girlfriend where they had split a bottle and a half of wine.\nOn the way home, the Applicant was stopped at a check point and arrested.  At the\ntime, he was driving with a suspended drivers license.  He was found guilty and ordered\nto attend alcohol counseling classes.  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year\nand he was fined about $3,000.00.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  For this offense, the\nApplicant attended a two hour group alcohol counseling class in February 2006.  His\ndriver\u2019s license was suspended from the date of the offense until he completed the\ncourse.  (Government Exhibit 4.) \nFollowing his arrest in 2005, although he still consumes alcohol, the Applicant\nstates that he no longer drinks and drives.  He states that he has significantly reduced\nthe amount of alcohol he consumes, now drinking between one and two drinks per\nsitting, and only at social or business occasions.  (Tr. p. 57.)  He last drank to the point\nof intoxication on New Years Even 2007.  (Tr. p. 58.)  He indicates that he has greatly\nmatured since his last arrest.  He has been married for the past year and a half, and has\na child on the way.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit T.)  His wife does not consume alcohol, and he\nno longer associates with the individuals with whom he used to drink.  (Tr. p. 59.)         \nThe Applicant agrees that he has made some bad decisions as a young, single\nprofessional, and takes full responsibility for his actions.  He has satisfied all of the court\nrequirements related to each criminal offense.  He has paid fines, served suspended\nsentences, attended classes and suffered personal embarrassment.  He more fully\n\n4\nunderstands the seriousness of his infractions and has drastically improved his lifestyle\nfor the better over the past five years.  \nThe Applicant submitted a statement of intent never to abuse alcohol again,\nwhich this court takes very seriously, indicating that should there be a future violation\nwith regard to alcohol use, he consents to have his security clearance automatically\nrevoked.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit U.)  \nLetters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from individuals\nwho have worked with the Applicant and know him well attest to his professionalism,\ndedication to the job and high performance, intelligence, attentiveness to details, and\nstrong leadership skills.  He is described as honest, trustworthy and an individual with\nhigh integrity.  He is considered to be an asset to the company.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A,\nB, N, O, P, and Q.)  Applicant submitted numerous certificates of completion for courses\nand training he has received.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D, E, F, H, K, I, J, K .)\nApplicant received the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Navy\nOverseas Service Ribbon, Korean Defense Service Medal and the National Defense\nService Medal.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits L and S.)\nApplicant received a Certificate of Appreciation for his professional and dedicated\nservice for his work in the United States Forces Korea.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.) \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n23.  (a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that is is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n23. (b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne. The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng. The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\n\n6\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline G of the SOR.  Under Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G,\nDisqualifying Conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and, 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d apply.  However, Mitigating\nConditions 23(a), so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that is is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n23(b), the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a\n\n7\npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\nalso apply. \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse over a five year period from 2000 to\n2005, resulted in three arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, and other\nrelated misconduct.  Although there is no formal diagnosis in the record of alcohol\ndependence, the Applicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol abuse is clearly indicative of a serious\nalcohol problem. Following his last arrest that occurred five years ago, in 2005, he has\nsignificantly reduced his alcohol consumption and has had no reoccurrence.  He has\nattended court ordered alcohol counseling and understands the negative effects of\nalcohol and recognizes that he has an alcohol problem.  Although he has not completely\nabstained from the use of alcohol, he has provided to this court a statement of intent\nthat indicates that if he abuses alcohol again, he is consenting to have his security\nclearance immediately revoked.  Under the particular facts of this case, sufficient time\nhas passed to demonstrate that the Applicant is in rehabilitation and will not relapse in\nthe future.  In the event that he does, his security clearance will be subject to immediate\nrevocation.  Accordingly Guideline G is found for the Applicant. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is a highly respected\nprofessional who has demonstrated that for at least the past five years he has\nsuccessfully battled his alcohol problem and has promised never to abuse alcohol\nagain.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under\nall of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of good\njudgement, trustworthiness, reliability, a willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may properly\nsafeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it mitigates the negative effects of his\nalcohol problem and the impact that it can have on his ability to safeguard classified\ninformation.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1  of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 19, 2011, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 27, 2012, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Francisco\nMendez granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased;\nwhether the Judge unreasonably restricted Department Counsel\u2019s presentation of his case; whether\nthe Judge erred in his application of the pertinent mitigating condition; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nwhole-person analysis was erroneous.  Consistent with the following, we remand the case to a\ndifferent Judge.  \nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born, raised, and\neducated in Pakistan.  His father was a member of the Pakistani Army, who passed away when\nApplicant was a teenager.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a U.S. citizen.  They conducted a long-distance\nrelationship by telephone, first meeting in January 1999.  They married two weeks later, in Pakistan.\nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in the mid-2000s.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Pakistan, who divides her residency between that country\nand the U.S.  Applicant and his siblings support her financially.  Applicant is close to his mother,\nspeaking to her frequently by telephone.  The two share a credit card account.  \nApplicant has several siblings.  One is an officer in the Pakistani military.  Another works\nfor a private company, but this sibling previously worked for a contractor with the Pakistani\ngovernment.  He has three other siblings who are also citizens and residents of Pakistan.  Applicant\nkeeps in regular touch with one of these three siblings.  He has another sibling who is a U.S. citizen\nliving in the U.S.  This sibling is married to a person who works for a U.S. Government contractor.\nThe in-law and Applicant had previously attempted to start up a company to do business with the\nU.S. Government, but they failed to secure adequate financing.\nApplicant has a cousin who is a U.S. citizen.  Applicant borrowed a significant amount of\nmoney from him a few years ago, in order to pay off personal debt.  He has since repaid the cousin\nand has lent him $15,000 for the purchase of a condo.  \nApplicant has saved money over the past six years and is able to assist his family financially.\nHe has lent them about $50,000 altogether.  \nApplicant has a friend who is a contract barber working on a U.S. military installation in a\nconflict zone. Applicant testified that his relationship with her is platonic.\nHe has a childhood friend who is a citizen and resident of Pakistan and who lives close to\nApplicant\u2019s mother.  Applicant last traveled to Pakistan in the late 2000s, between Government\n\n1Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(b): \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\n3\ncontracting jobs.  He visited his family while there and complied with his employer\u2019s reporting\nrequirements.  He listed these trips on his security clearance application (SCA) and during clearance\ninterviews.\nApplicant began working as a Government contractor in the mid-2000s.  He was assigned\nto a U.S. military unit in a conflict zone.  He accompanied this unit on missions into the field two\nor three times a month.  On a number of occasions, he saved the lives of members of his unit by\nlistening in on enemy radio traffic and alerting his unit of possible ambushes.  On one occasion,\nApplicant and the convoy he was attached to came under enemy fire.  \nApplicant\u2019s job circumstances did not allow for adequate vacation time and began causing\ntrouble for his marriage.  He left the employ of this contractor in the late 2000s.  \nSoon after, Applicant underwent counterintelligence screening, which expanded on\ninformation he had previously provided on his SCA.  This investigation uncovered nothing of\nsecurity significance.  \nApplicant began working for his current contractor employer in the year following this\nscreening.  He works as a linguist on a U.S. military installation in a conflict zone.  Although he no\nlonger accompanies troops to the field, he has been under constant attack from the enemy.  At least\nonce a week, the base is hit by enemy rockets and mortars.  Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation\nat work.  One person stated that there are few as committed to the job as Applicant and that\nApplicant is looking after the greater good of those who work on the installation.  Another person\ntestified that Applicant is an exemplary employee.\nApplicant and his spouse have resided at the same address in the U.S. since 2001.  The house\nis owned by Applicant\u2019s uncle and aunt.  He has a substantial amount of money in his 401(k) plan,\nand he owns no foreign property.  \nPakistan, a developing nation, is a parliamentary federal republic that has recently gone\nthrough an election cycle.  The core of Al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ) is based there, and its leader, Osama bin\nLaden, was killed there by U.S. forces.  AQ, the Taliban, and other militant organizations operate\nfrom safe havens in that country and coordinate attacks from there.  These groups specifically target\nU.S. and other Western citizens.  Elements within the Pakistani government commit significant\nhuman rights abuses.\nIn the Analysis, the Judge concluded that the Pakistani citizenship of Applicant\u2019s mother and\nsiblings, along with the geopolitical circumstances of that country, raised security concerns under\nGuideline B.  The Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation in the context of Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 8(b).1  The Judge cited a prior Appeal Board case which\n\nin favor of the U.S. interest[.]\u201d  \n2See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  \n4\nextended favorable consideration to an applicant\u2019s \u201cproven record of action in defense of the U.S.\u201d\nwhile serving as a translator in conflict zone.2  The Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s bonds to his family\nin Pakistan are \u201clong and deep, especially when it comes to his mother.\u201d  Decision at 12.  The Judge\nstated, however, that the chance of foreign exploitation of Applicant through his family has existed\nfor several years, without incident or concern.  Additionally, the Judge noted the counterintelligence\nscreening which Applicant underwent, concluding that it buttressed Applicant\u2019s claims that he is not\na security risk. \nApplying the whole-person concept, the Judge cited to evidence of Applicant\u2019s having \u201cput\nhimself in harms way\u201d in order to support U.S. security interests.  Decision at 12.  He noted\nevidence concerning the effect of Applicant\u2019s foreign service on his marriage and his compliance\nwith Government requests for information.  The Judge also noted Applicant\u2019s stated willingness to\ntake a polygraph examination.  He concluded that the record evidence as a whole left him with no\n\u201cquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\u201d  Decision\nat 13.   \nDiscussion \n  A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\n\n5\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge was biased against the Government.  There is\na rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial.  A party seeking to rebut that presumption has\na heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-07395 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 14,\n2010).  \nIn attempting to meet that burden, Department Counsel cites to instances during the hearing\nin which he believes the Judge evidenced bias.  Department Counsel contends that the Judge\nevidenced bias during Government cross examination about persons who knew Applicant, a question\non the SCA.  Department Counsel was attempting to elicit information about the extent of\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with three named individuals.  The Judge interjected:\n[Judge]: For the last six years you\u2019ve been in [conflict zone] fighting in the War on\nTerror, right?\n[Applicant]: Right.\n[Judge]: So you haven\u2019t had time to like associate with those folks back in [U.S. city]\nright?\n[Applicant]: That\u2019s correct, sir.\n[Judge]: Is that where you were going to?\n[DC]: Your honor, the question is addressing the extent of his ties to the U.S.\n[Judge]: I understand, counsel.  Understand something, counsel.  He\u2019s been in\n[conflict zone] for the last six years.  I recognize that.  I also hope that you recognize\nhe\u2019s been in [conflict zone] for the last six years, basically at the tip of the sphere,\nso I\u2019ll let you go on with this, but I just want to make sure that everybody here has\nthat same perspective.  Tr. at 59-60.  (emphasis added).  \nDepartment Counsel argues that this colloquy could suggest to a reasonable person that the\nJudge had already made up his mind concerning a major aspect of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation,\n\n3In the questioning leading up to this, Department Counsel had asked Applicant whether his wedding ceremony\nwere civil or religious.  When Applicant replied that it was religious, Department Counsel asked what the religion was.\nAt this point, the Judge interjected, stating that this evidence was not relevant.  Tr. at 50.  An applicant\u2019s religious beliefs,\nas such, generally have no security significance.  Applicant\u2019s religion or choice of a  wedding, viewed in and of itself,\nhad no bearing upon his fitness for a clearance.  The Judge\u2019s apparent belief that Department Counsel was suggesting\notherwise may have colored his evaluation of the Government\u2019s case as a whole.  It is well established DoD policy that\nan individual\u2019s religious affiliation plays no part in the security clearance process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-02902\nat 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011).  The Judge did not err in interrupting Department Counsel to clarify the reasons for his\nquestion.  However, reading this question in context, we do not conclude that Department Counsel was imputing security\nconcerns to Applicant\u2019s religious beliefs.  Rather, Department Counsel was trying to explore the depth of Applicant\u2019s\nconnections to the U.S. through his wife and the extent to which Applicant\u2019s marriage was one of convenience to enable\nhim to acquire U.S. citizenship.  The nature of such a ceremony or a discrepancy between the spouses\u2019 views was\nrelevant to this question.  \n6\nhis evidence of service to the U.S. under dangerous circumstances.  We find this argument to be\npersuasive, noting in particular the italicized language above.\n  \nDepartment Counsel cites to other portions of the hearing in which the Judge appeared to\ndemonstrate bias.  Much of the Government\u2019s case was devoted to showing that Applicant\u2019s ties to\nthe U.S. were relatively weak when compared to his ties within Pakistan.  It was not improper,\ntherefore, for Department Counsel to explore the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s wedding and his\nrelationship with another woman, to include their trip together in the late 2000s.  His brief notes\nrecord evidence that Applicant and his wife married within less than a year after she herself became\na naturalized citizen, that they married only two weeks after their first face-to-face meeting, and that\nApplicant had a long-standing relationship with a woman (a foreign national living outside the U.S.)\nwhile he was married to his wife.  Department Counsel argues that he sought to elicit at the hearing\ninformation about the marriage as well as about Applicant\u2019s friendship with the other woman, in\norder to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s ties in the U.S. through his wife are relatively weak, thereby\nanticipating an argument under FIMC 8(b).  However, the Judge cut off Department Counsel\u2019s\nquestioning about the circumstances of the marriage, stating that he did not see the relevance of the\nrespective ages of Applicant and his wife and asking if Department Counsel were suggesting that\nthe marriage was fraudulent.3  Department Counsel replied that he was exploring the extent to which\nApplicant\u2019s strongest tie to the U.S., his marriage, was \u201ca relatively weak marital relationship[.]\u201d\nTr. at 53.  The Judge replied \u201cI\u2019ve let you go on for a while.  I\u2019m not seeing it.  Move on from this\npoint.\u201d  Tr. at 54.  \nDepartment Counsel also cites to his questions concerning Applicant\u2019s relationship with the\nother woman.  In the late 2000s, the two took a trip together, spending eleven days in her native\ncountry before proceeding to the country where Applicant was based.  The Judge asked if the\nwoman\u2019s native country was a place from which Applicant was expected to enter and exit the\ncountry where he was based, and Applicant replied that it was.  After this question by the Judge,\nApplicant stated in response to Department Counsel that his eleven-day stay in this country, during\nwhich he engaged in gambling activities, was merely a transit stop.  Tr. at 75.  Department Counsel\nargues that the effect of the Judge\u2019s sua sponte question was to influence Applicant\u2019s testimony  so\nas to mis-characterize Applicant\u2019s travels with the woman.\n\n7\nConsidering Department Counsel\u2019s arguments in light of the record as a whole, we conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s conduct, viewed in toto, could convince a reasonable person that he had an\ninflexible predisposition in favor of Applicant, influenced at least in part by an apparent acceptance,\nprior to the close of the record, of Applicant\u2019s evidence concerning his service under dangerous\ncircumstances.  A reasonable person could believe that this predisposition influenced the Judge\u2019s\ndecisions to curtail Department Counsel cross examination and to interject comments that suggested\nto Applicant exculpatory answers to Department Counsel questions.  While a Judge enjoys\ndiscretion in his conduct of a hearing, that discretion must be exercised with impartiality, both actual\nand apparent.  We conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand it to a different Judge\nfor a new hearing.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.    \nSigned: Michael Y.

Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd.

Glendon, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nRaashid S. Williams, Esq, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: \nChristopher Graham, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the Foreign Influence concern raised by his familial ties to \nPakistan. He has been working as a Government contractor in Afghanistan for nearly \nseven years. His efforts have directly saved the lives of U.S. and NATO troops. He has \ncome under enemy fire, and he continues to place his life at risk in support of the vital \nU.S. national security interests in Afghanistan. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 8, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). He fully disclosed his family in Pakistan on his SCA. He has been working as a \nDoD contract linguist in Afghanistan ever since, except for a short two month period in \nlate 2007 when he changed employment.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 27, 2012\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nOn May 19, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) made a \npreliminary determination to deny Applicant access to classified information.1 The basis \nfor this decision is set forth in a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that alleges the security \nconcern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Applicant responded on September 26, \n2011 (Answer). He admitted that his mother, two brothers, and three of his sisters, as \nwell as his married siblings\u2019 respective spouses, are resident-citizens of Pakistan. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d). He denied the other SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.i), and \nrequested a hearing. \n \n \nOn July 19, 2011, Department Counsel indicated the Government was ready-to-\nproceed. After coordinating with the parties, I scheduled the hearing for September 1, \n2011.2 At hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n12, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel also \nsubmitted GE I through VIII for administrative notice regarding Pakistan.3 Applicant \nappeared at the hearing with his counsel, called his facility security officer (FSO) as a \nwitness, and testified on his own behalf. He offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nJ, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on September 12, 2011. \n \nEvidentiary Issue \n \n \nGE 11 and 12, Applicant\u2019s selective service record and card, were admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel extensively questioned Applicant about \npurported discrepancies between these documents and his SCA, specifically as it \nrelates to his date of birth and social security number. (Tr. at 33 \u2013 42). As there was no \nSOR allegation regarding these matters, I allowed such inquiry for the limited purpose of \ntesting Applicant\u2019s credibility and mitigation case.4 \n \n \nThe evidence established that Applicant\u2019s former FSO had typed in Applicant\u2019s \ndate of birth incorrectly on the SCA. Applicant corrected this information during a \nbackground interview in April 2009. (GE 5 at 1). Applicant voluntarily produced his \nsocial security card at hearing. The number reflected on Applicant\u2019s social security card \nand his SCA are the same. (Tr. at 102 \u2013 103). \n \n1 This action was taken pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \n2 As a time-management tool, I issued a prehearing order requiring the parties to serve one \nanother their anticipated exhibits prior to the hearing. The parties complied. \n \n3 Department Counsel submitted a summary of facts from GE I - VIII that the Government asks I \ntake administrative notice. The facts administratively noticed are set forth in my findings of fact. I note that \nvast parts of the copies of administrative notice documents that were submitted are illegible.  \n \n4 See generally ISCR Case No. 10-00922 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2011). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I provided the Government the opportunity to \namend the SOR to address any concerns they had regarding Applicant\u2019s selective \nservice record and SCA, and in order to provide Applicant fair notice to address said \nconcerns.5 Department Counsel responded that \u201cthe Government doesn\u2019t believe the \npotential falsifications or discrepancies warrant an amendment of the SOR.\u201d6  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nImmigrating to the U.S. \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. He was born, raised, and educated in Pakistan. His \nfather, who was an officer in the Pakistani army, passed away when he was 13 years \nold. After his father passed away, Applicant\u2019s uncles financially supported him and his \nfamily. Applicant\u2019s uncles are Danish citizens, residing in Denmark. One of his uncles \nowns the home that Applicant was raised in, and his mother still resides in. Applicant \nmet his wife in 1998 through an aunt. Applicant\u2019s wife and his aunt are U.S. citizens, \nresiding in the United States. Applicant and his wife started a long-distance relationship \nby telephone. They met in person in January 1999 and two-weeks later were married in \nPakistan. Applicant received his visa and immigrated to the U.S. in May 2000. Between \nthe time of his marriage and immigrating to the United States, Applicant operated a \nfamily business, but it was not financially successful. During this period, Applicant was \nsupported by his Danish uncles. He was granted U.S. citizenship in 2004.7 \n \nForeign Family and Friends \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Pakistan. She spends about half the year living \nin the United States, and the other half of the year in Pakistan. She is a woman of \nlimited means, and is financially supported by Applicant and his siblings. Applicant is \nclose to his mother. He speaks to her frequently by phone and shared a credit card \naccount with her.8 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He did not receive anything from the estates of his \ngrandmothers when they died, and does not expect to inherit from his mother\u2019s meager \nestate when she dies.9 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 10-08560 at n. 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2011); ISCR Case No. 04-08547 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2007).  \n \n6 Tr. at 122-123. Applicant provided the Government his selective service card in July 2008, and \nhe was interviewed thereafter on two separate occasions. I must presume the Government investigated \nthis matter thoroughly in the three years leading up to the hearing. ISCR Case No. 07-18324 at 6 (App. \nBd.

One is an officer in the \nPakistani military, assigned to a civil engineering unit doing reconstruction work. He \nholds a rank below Colonel. He is married, and his wife is also a resident-citizen of \nPakistan. Applicant\u2019s other brother currently works for a private cell phone company, but \npreviously worked as a contractor for the Pakistani government. Applicant is not as \nclose to his brothers as he is to his mother. He does speak with them by phone, has \nvisited with them when he has traveled to Pakistan, and shared a credit card account \nwith one of his brothers.10 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d). \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s four sisters are resident-citizens of Pakistan. Two of these \nsisters work for local schools in Pakistan. The other does not have a job outside the \nhome and is married to a resident-citizen of Pakistan. Her husband works for the same \ncell phone company as Applicant\u2019s brother. Applicant is in regular contact with his \nmiddle sister in Pakistan, who keeps him informed of his mother\u2019s wellbeing. He speaks \nless often to his other two sisters in Pakistan.11 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fourth sister is a U.S. citizen, living in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nmother lives with her when she visits the U.S. Applicant\u2019s sister is married and her \nhusband is a U.S. citizen. He holds a security clearance and is a Government contractor \nworking in Afghanistan. In late 2007, when Applicant was in between jobs, he and his \nbrother-in-law tried to start their own business as Government contractors in \nAfghanistan. The business never got off the ground due to the lack of adequate financial \nbacking.12 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n \n \nApplicant is close to a cousin who is a U.S. citizen. Several years ago, Applicant \nborrowed a significant amount of money from his cousin to pay-off some personal debt. \nApplicant repaid his cousin this loan, and recently lent his cousin about $15,000 so his \ncousin could purchase a condo in the United States. A few days before the hearing, this \nloan was repaid. Applicant\u2019s cousin holds a security clearance and is currently working \nfor a Government contractor in Afghanistan.13 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n \n \nApplicant has been able to save a significant amount of money over the past six \nyears and is now in a position to financially assist his family. Altogether, he has lent his \nfamily about $50,000. He does so in part to pay back his family, including one of his \nDanish uncles, for supporting him during his time of need.14 \n \n10 Tr. at 23-24, 63-64, 100-101; Answer, GE 1 at 21-22, GE 2 at 1-3; GE 5 at 2-3; GE 7, FI; GE 8, \n4/10/08 Special Interview (SI) at 3-4; GE 9; GE 10 at 8. \n \n11 Tr. at 24-26, 65; Answer, GE 1 at 22-23, GE 5 at 3; GE 7, FI; GE 8, SI at 3-5; GE 9. \n \n12 Tr. at 26, 101-102; Answer, GE 1; GE 5; GE 8. \n \n13 Tr. at 82-85, 91, 109, 111-112; Answer; GE 2; GE 5; GE 9.

See also GE 3 and 4.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant became friends with his barber while assigned to Afghanistan. She is \nfrom Country Y and is a contract barber for NATO working in Afghanistan. She works on \none of the U.S. military installations and was screened by the Government before being \nallowed to work on the installation. For a period of time, she served as a Government \ncontractor escorting foreign nationals onto a U.S. military installation in Afghanistan. \nApplicant testified that his relationship with this woman is platonic.15 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \n \nApplicant has a childhood friend who is a resident-citizen of Pakistan, and lives \nclose to his mother\u2019s house in Pakistan. Applicant is unsure what his friend does for a \nliving, but he previously worked for a cell phone company in Pakistan. His friend never \nworked for the Pakistani government or military. Applicant\u2019s contact with this childhood \nfriend has been limited and he has not spoken to him in quite some time. He has never \ndiscussed his work for the U.S. Government with his childhood friend. Whenever his \nfriend asked what he did for a living, he would merely say that he was working for a \ncasino in the U.S.16 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). \n \n \nApplicant last traveled to Pakistan in 2007, while in between Government \ncontracting jobs. He visited his family while in Pakistan. He has also traveled \nextensively. He has reported his foreign travel to his FSO, on his SCA, and during his \nbackground interviews.17 During one background interview, Applicant stated that he will \nreport any attempt to influence him through his family to the proper authorities, as \nfollows: \n \nI have no sympathy for any other country or groups that would do harm to \nthe US or our allies. Even though my family still lives in Pakistan, my \nloyalty is to the US. If I learned that my family\u2019s welfare could be in danger \nbased on my position, I would do everything I could to help them but my \nefforts would be through the appropriate channels. I would first report the \nissue to my security officer.18 \n \nService as a Linguist: 2005 \u2013 Present \n \n \nApplicant started working for Government Contractor A (GCA) in May 2005. He \nwas assigned to a NATO military unit in Afghanistan. During this period, he \naccompanied his military unit on missions in the field two to three times a month, \nspending up to 10 to 15 days a month in the field. On a number of occasions, Applicant \nsaved the lives of members of his unit by listening in on enemy radio traffic and alerting \nhis unit when the enemy was attempting to ambush them. Applicant and his unit were \nambushed by the enemy on one occasion and the convoy he was riding in took direct \n                                                          \n15 Tr. at 28-30, 70-81, 108; GE 2 at 3; GE 5 at 5-7, 13; GE 7, Sexual Behavior; GE 9. \n \n16 Tr. at 30; Answer, GE 5 at 11. \n \n17 GE 1; GE 5 at 6-7, 13; GE 9; GE 10; Tr. at 80. \n \n18 GE 5 at 8.

His employment with GCA was made more difficult by the lack of adequate \nvacation time to return home to see his wife, which strained his marriage to the point of \nit almost dissolving. He voluntary left GCA\u2019s employment in October 2007.19 \n \n \nApplicant underwent a counterintelligence (CI) security screening on August 9, \n2007. This CI screening expanded upon the information Applicant had previously \nprovided in his SCA and delved more fully into other potential areas of concern. \nApplicant fully discussed his foreign connections, including his family in Pakistan.20 \nApplicant stated that he would immediately report to his boss if he were ever \napproached by a foreign government, foreign intelligence or security service, or terrorist \norganization. He also stated that if he were captured by the enemy or terrorist \norganization, he would protect U.S. secrets \u201cwith his life.\u201d21 The Government \ninvestigator concluded that Applicant \u201cspeaks excellent English . . . as if it were his first \nlanguage even though Candidate was born and raised in Pakistan. . . . Candidate \nshowed no sign of deception during subject interview . . . [he] displayed little or no \nhesitation while discussing the details of his personal life.\u201d The investigator went on to \nrecommend Applicant for a security clearance, as long as the criminal background and \ncredit checks did not reveal any derogatory information.22  \n \n \nApplicant began working for Government Contractor B (GCB) in January 2008. \nHe was assigned as a linguist working at a U.S. military installation in Afghanistan. \nApplicant submitted an updated SCA when he began working for GCB. Applicant \nrequires a security clearance because it is a condition of his employment.23  \n \nApplicant no longer accompanies troops into the field, but has been under \nconstant attack from the enemy at his current U.S. military base. At least once a week, \nthe base is hit by enemy rockets and mortars. The shelling has come as close as 30 \nmeters from his office. Applicant works long hours and lives on base in a GCB provided \ntrailer. He provides vital support to the base in its screening and CI efforts. He cannot \nleave the base because it is far too dangerous as it is well known by the local populace \nthat he works for the United States.24 \n \n \n19 Tr. at 21-22, 94-98, 112-113; GE 5 at 6-7. Applicant did not accept a follow-on contract with \nGCA because they wanted to place him with a special operations unit that engages in the most \ndangerous operations. He is unwilling to risk his life so brazenly, but was willing to return to his NATO unit \nor take on other dangerous assignments in Afghanistan. Such decision does not detract from his service. \n \n20 GE 9 and 10. \n \n21 GE 10 at 11, Q. 76 and 78. \n \n22 Id. at 2-3. \n \n23 Tr. at 18-20, 94, 118.

Each speaks to Applicant\u2019s exemplary work ethic, \ndedication to the mission, and irreplaceable linguistic skills that has provided for the \nsecurity of U.S. and NATO troops. He has received a number of certificates of \nappreciation for his service.25 A Vice President for GCB, who has 32 years of \nexperience in the intelligence and security fields and was Applicant\u2019s manager in \nAfghanistan, states: \n \nI first met (Applicant) . . . in January 2008. (Applicant) was one of six \nAmerican interpreters assigned to my project, but immediately he was the \nstand out of the group. . . . (Applicant) is the most conscientious and \ndiligent interpreter on my staff. . . . Armed with multi-lingual abilities in \nPashto, Urdu, and Hindi, in addition to English . . . (he) was quick to point \nout inconsistencies in applications, noted falsifications on official \ndocuments . . . (He) took on a personal obligation to ensure that all \npersons applying for [sic] were doing so legitimately and correctly. \n(Applicant) was responsible for identifying and effectively stopping several \nattempts by banned individuals trying to circumvent our security \nprocesses. (He) has a high sense of patriotism to the United States. He \nhas never tolerated anyone to speak ill of his adopted country and would \nbe the first to squash any anti-American sentiment . . . I have watched and \nmanaged many individuals who work in the contracting world, but there \nare very few that are as committed as (Applicant) . . . He is not chasing a \ncontractor\u2019s paycheck, he is looking after his (GCB) family and for the \ngreater good of the lives of those who live and work at (the base).26 \n \nApplicant\u2019s FSO testified that Applicant was one of the first individuals GCB \nhired, and they have continued to employ him, even without the necessary security \nclearance, because he is an exemplary employee. The FSO further testified that it is \ndifficult to find qualified linguist for this project. Applicant has referred a number of \nexcellent candidates that GCB has hired. The FSO \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d recommends \nApplicant for a security clearance.27 \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse have resided at the same address in the U.S. since \n2001. It is a home that is owned by Applicant\u2019s uncle and aunt, who are U.S. citizens \nand first introduced Applicant to his future wife. He has a substantial amount of money \nsaved in a U.S. bank account. It is a joint account with his wife and she manages the \ncouple\u2019s finances. He has also saved some money through a 401K account. He does \nnot own any foreign property and has no foreign financial interest.28 He is willing \u201cto \n \n25 AE A \u2013 J.  \n \n26 AE A.

It is a developing nation, which is still dealing with natural \ndisasters that devastated parts of the country in 2005 and 2010. The core of Al-Qa\u2019ida \n(AQ) is based in Pakistan and its former leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. \nforces in Pakistan in 2011. AQ, the Taliban, and other militants are operating from safe \nhavens within Pakistan. According to U.S. intelligence, Pakistani-based militant groups \nand AQ are coordinating their attacks inside Pakistan from the relative safety of these \nsafe havens. The presence of these groups poses a potential danger to U.S. citizens \nthroughout Pakistan. These groups specifically target U.S. citizens and other Western \ninterest, and have successfully carried out attacks and kidnappings against U.S. \ncitizens. They have also committed major terrorist attacks against the Pakistani \ngovernment and its citizens. As for the Pakistani government, the U.S. State \nDepartment has noted that elements within the government continue to commit major \nhuman rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and torture. The \nfailure to prosecute these abuses has led to a culture of impunity.30  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision.  \n \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \u201cA \nclearance adjudication is an applicant\u2019s opportunity to demonstrate that, prior to being \nawarded a clearance, he (or she) actually possesses the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness essential to a fiduciary relationship with this country.\u201d32 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe foreign influence concern is set forth at AG \u00b6 6, as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n31 ISCR Case No. 11-00391 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 2011) (\u201cOnce an applicant\u2019s SOR admissions \nand/or the Government\u2019s evidence raise a security concern, the burden of persuasion shifts to the \napplicant to mitigate the concern.\u201d).  \n \n32 ISCR Case No. 10-09986 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2011). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nAn applicant\u2019s familial ties to a foreign country can raise the foreign influence \nconcern. There is no per se rule against applicants with familial ties to a foreign country, \neven countries that contain elements, within and outside the foreign government, hostile \nto the vital security interest of the United States. Instead, an applicant with familial ties \nto such a country bears a heavy burden in mitigating the foreign influence concern.33 \n \nIn addressing the foreign influence concern, key factors an administrative judge \nmust consider are:  the foreign government involved, the intelligence gathering history \nof that government, the country\u2019s human rights record, and the presence of terrorist \nactivity in that country.34  \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin and brother-in-law do not raise the foreign influence concern. \nThey are both U.S. citizens, who have been granted security clearances by the United \nStates, and work as Government contractors in Afghanistan. As for Applicant\u2019s barber, \nthe Government stated its concern was due to the fact that she resides in Afghanistan, \nand Applicant has frequent contact with her in Afghanistan. (Tr. at 127-128). However, \nshe is a NATO contractor supporting the U.S.-led war effort in Afghanistan. She has \nbeen screened by the Government, and previously was in charge of escorting \nindividuals onto a U.S.-military installation. The Government failed to establish that \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his barber creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation that \nis different from his contacts with others he serves with in Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his old childhood friend also does not raise the foreign influence \nconcern, because their bond is no longer sufficiently close that it could be used by a \nforeign power or entity to manipulate or induce him. Accordingly, I find in Applicants \nfavor as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i.35 \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s familial ties to Pakistan through his mother, two \nbrothers, and three sisters, coupled with Pakistan\u2019s \u201chuman rights record, the presence \nof terrorist activity there, and other geopolitical factors,\u201d squarely implicates the foreign \ninfluence concern.36 His frequent contact with, and deep connections to, these family \nmembers also establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \n \n33 ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 10 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (\u201cAs a matter of common sense and \nsound risk management under the \u2018clearly consistent with the national interest\u2019 standard, an applicant \nwith immediate family members living in a country hostile to the United States should not be granted a \nsecurity clearance without a very strong showing that those family ties do not pose a security risk.\u201d).  \n \n34 ISCR Case No. 09-05812 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 2011) (heightened risk of foreign influence \nestablished where applicant\u2019s family members resided in a country that has trouble with terrorism and \nhistory of human rights abuses). \n \n35 I also find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 1.f, because the potential inheritance he might receive \nfrom his mother\u2019s meager estate is simply insufficient to raise a concern.  \n \n36 ISCR Case No. 11-01920 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2011). \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 sets forth a number of mitigating conditions that could mitigate the foreign \ninfluence concern. I have considered all the mitigating conditions and find that only AG \n\u00b6 8(b) warrants discussion. AG \u00b6 8(b) states: \n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \n \nIn addressing AG \u00b6 8(b), the Appeal Board has held that \n \nGenerally, an Applicant\u2019s statements, by themselves, as to what he would \ndo in the face of threats by a foreign government or entity are entitled to \nlittle weight. On the other hand, an applicant\u2019s proven record of action in \ndefense of the U.S. is very important and can lead to a favorable result for \nan applicant in a Guideline B case. In this case, Applicant has served the \nU.S. military as a translator in dangerous circumstances in Afghanistan \nand has risked his life to protect American personnel there.37 \n \n \nApplicant has saved the lives of NATO troops in Afghanistan, he has been under \ndirect fire when his convoy was ambushed, his work has directly provided for the safety \nof American and NATO troops, and he has lived with constant shelling over the past few \nyears \u2013 all in support of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan. However, such service \ndoes not automatically trump the Guideline B concern as argued by Applicant\u2019s counsel. \n(Tr. at 129). Instead, it is a key factor that must be taken into account in addressing the \nforeign influence concern.  \n \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States 12 years ago, he took the Oath of \nAllegiance upon becoming a U.S. citizen in 2004, and has been married to a U.S. \ncitizen and resided at the same address in the U.S. for over a decade. His assets are in \nthe U.S., and his wife manages their finances. At the same time, Applicant\u2019s bonds to \n \n37 ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (internal citations omitted). See also \nISCR Case No. 06-25928 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008) (adverse decision remanded because judge apparently \nfailed to consider that applicant\u2019s \u201ccompliance with security procedures and regulations occurred in the \ncontext of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the national security.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) (same).  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nhis family in Pakistan are long and deep, especially when it comes to his mother. He \nspeaks with her frequently, supports her financially, and even had a joint credit card \naccount with her. His brother is an officer in the Pakistani military. As Applicant \nacknowledges, there is no place in Pakistan that is safe. The risk of foreign exploitation \nexists. However, none of Applicant\u2019s family members hold high government positions or \notherwise standout as targets to hostile forces within Pakistan.38 For the past six years, \nthe same risk of foreign exploitation identified in the SOR has existed, and Applicant\u2019s \nfidelity to the U.S. and its mission in Afghanistan has never once faltered or been \nquestioned by those with whom he serves.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant may not have been born in the United States, he has \ndemonstrated, through his service in Afghanistan, that his commitment to the U.S. is no \nless than those born and raised in this country. He has voluntarily agreed to CI \nscreening and numerous background investigations, in order to prove his suitability to \nhold a security clearance. The agent who conducted his CI screening, as well as those \nwho have served with him in Afghanistan, all found him to be a dedicated American and \nresolute in his resolve to protect the nation and its secrets. He has fully complied with \nreporting requirements throughout the security clearance process and those imposed by \nhis employer. Over the course of several interviews and in response to a lengthy \ninterrogatory, Applicant has freely and fully discussed his foreign connections. In light of \nthe foregoing, I find that Applicant would resolve any attempt to influence him through \nhis family members in Pakistan in favor of national security. Applicant established AG \u00b6 \n8(b) and, thereby, mitigated the foreign influence concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).39 I incorporate my foreign influence analysis herein and \nnote some additional whole-person factors. Applicant has volunteered to put himself in \nharms way in order to support the vital national security interests of the United States in \nAfghanistan. As relayed by his former manager, Applicant\u2019s motivation is not to chase a \ncontractor\u2019s paycheck, but instead to provide for the safety and security of those with \nwhom he serves in Afghanistan. His service has not come without sacrifice, including \nalmost losing his marriage due to the lack of adequate vacation time to return home on \n \n38 Contrast with ISCR Case No. 09-07066 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2011) (father held important position \nin the embassy of a foreign country); ISCR Case No. 09-06457 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011) (prominent \nfather in Afghan government).  \n \n39 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nleave to visit his wife. He has understood the Government\u2019s need to peer into his foreign \nrelationships and has always complied with any request for information. Even after \nnumerous interviews over the past seven years, Applicant still stands ready to prove his \nsuitability by offering to take a polygraph. These whole-person factors, in conjunction \nwith the favorable matters noted above, fully mitigate the foreign influence concern. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings regarding the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \n     FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \n \n \n \n     For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record evidence and for the foregoing reasons, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________ \nFrancisco Mendez \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 8, 2005. On \nMay 19, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified him that it \nwas unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \naccess to classified information, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an \nadministrative judge for a determination whether to grant or deny his application. DOHA \nset forth the basis for its action in a Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing security \nconcerns under Guideline B. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n 06/29/2012\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 2, 2011, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 19, 2011, \nand the case was assigned an administrative judge. The administrative judge conducted \nthe hearing on September 1, 2011. At the hearing, Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 12, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through J, which were admitted without objection. The administrative \njudge took administrative notice of relevant facts about Pakistan, based on eight \ndocuments presented by Department Counsel. On January 27, 2012, the administrative \njudge granted Applicant a security clearance. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel timely appealed the administrative judge\u2019s decision, \ncontending that the administrative judge showed bias in favor of Applicant during the \nhearing. The Appeal Board found Department Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive. On May \n25, 2012, the Appeal Board remanded the case for a new hearing by a different \nadministrative judge.  \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on June 1, 2012. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non June 6, 2012, scheduling it for June 13, 2012. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nApplicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice requirement in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 12 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through J from \nthe first hearing were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant also submitted \nfive additional exhibits, marked as AX II-A through II-E, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified and presented the testimony of six witnesses. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the second hearing on June 19, 2012. All references to \nthe transcript in this decision refer to the second hearing, unless specifically noted \notherwise. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Pakistan. The request and the documents attached as enclosures were not \nadmitted in evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I through \nVIII. Department Counsel did not request that I take administrative notice of any facts \nabout Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan, both of which are mentioned in the SOR, and I have \nnot done so. The facts about Pakistan that I have administratively noticed are set out \nbelow in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d, and he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.i. His admissions in \nhis answer and at the two hearings are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old linguist employed by defense contractors since \nSeptember 2005. (Tr. 79.) He was hired under a North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(NATO) contract to provide \u201csecurity vetting services\u201d in Afghanistan. He works on a \nteam that interviews and screens Afghan and other foreign nationals seeking \nemployment with defense contractors. (Tr. 33-34.) The contractor sponsored Applicant \nfor a clearance because of the likelihood that the contract will be changed to require all \nemployees to have a clearance. (September 2011 Transcript at 115-18.) Applicant has \nnever held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Pakistan. He received a college degree in Pakistan and \nthen operated a family-owned construction business from 1996 to 2000. Because the \nbusiness was not profitable, Applicant and his family received financial support from two \nuncles who are citizens and residents of Denmark. (GX 5 at 1.) \n \n \nApplicant was introduced to his now wife by an aunt who immigrated to the \nUnited States in the 1980s. Beginning in 1998, Applicant and his now wife conversed \nweekly by telephone. His wife is a native of Germany who came to the United States \nwith her family when she was four years old. She has been a naturalized U.S. citizen \nsince June 1998. His now wife came to Pakistan in January 1999 and they were \nmarried two weeks later. (GX 5 at 4.) None of his wife\u2019s family members attended the \nwedding, but numerous members of Applicant\u2019s family attended. (Tr. 146-47.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is 49 years old and lives in the United States. She and Applicant \nhave no children. Applicant\u2019s wife lives in a house owned by Applicant\u2019s aunt and uncle, \nwho are U.S. citizens, hold security clearances, and are currently deployed to \nAfghanistan as linguists. (Tr. 89.) Applicant\u2019s aunt and uncle have no children, but they \ntreat Applicant as their son. (Tr. 91.) Applicant does not pay rent to his uncle for use of \nthe house, but he pays some of the household expenses. (Tr. 137-38.)  \n \n \nApplicant came to the United States in May 2000 on a marriage visa. He became \na U.S. citizen in May 2004. He renounced his Pakistani citizenship and surrendered his \nPakistani passport.1  \n \nApplicant worked in various casinos in the United States from May 2000 until he \nbegan working for a defense contractor in May 2005. He gambled heavily while working \nin the casinos and accumulated around $50,000 in gambling debts. He borrowed about \n$25,000 from a cousin and repaid the loan after he began working for a defense \ncontractor. He later loaned $10,000 to this cousin, and the loan has been repaid. (GX 2 \nat 2-3; Tr. 102.) His cousin is a U.S. citizen who holds a security clearance and is \nemployed by a defense contractor as a linguist. (GX 5 at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant also loaned money to other family members after 2005. He loaned \n$9,900 to the same uncle who helped Applicant\u2019s family, to enable his uncle to buy an \napartment. He made loans of $3,000 to two cousins, $5,000 to a cousin, and $8,000 to \nthe sister who is a U.S. citizen. One of the $3,000 loans has been repaid. Applicant is \n                                                          \n1 Neither side submitted any evidence addressing whether Pakistan recognizes a right to renounce \ncitizenship. However, it is clear that Applicant believes he has renounced his Pakistani citizenship. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nnot concerned about the loan to his uncle because of the help the uncle had previously \nprovided to his family. (GX 2 at 2.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) in September \n2005, his birth date was erroneously listed as March 1976 instead of February 1976, \none digit of his Social Security number was incorrect, and one digit of his Selective \nService registration number was incorrect.2 (GX 1 at 6, 29.) He underwent counter-\nintelligence (CI) screening in August 2007, but his first interview by an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator was in April 2008. In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, he submitted a copy of the Selective Service registration card reflecting \nthe correct registration number. (GX 11; GX 12.) At the hearing, Applicant denied \nintentionally providing inaccurate information in his SCA to delay the investigation. To \nthe contrary, he complained about the delay and asked for help in expediting the \nprocessing of his SCA.3 (Tr. 176-77.) \n \n \nFrom May until October 2007, Applicant was deployed with a NATO combat unit \non patrol in the field. His job was to monitor radio traffic and alert his commander to \nanything that might threaten the unit. His unit was ambushed several times. On several \noccasions he provided information that saved the lives of soldiers in his unit. (Tr. 79-82, \n123-24.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first contract as a linguist ended in October 2007. He knew that, if he \nrenewed his contract, he would be again assigned to a combat unit in the field. He \nchose not to renew his contract because of the dangerous duties it involved. (GX 5 at \n6.) His site manager noted on the exit interview form that Applicant is \u201ca 5-star linguist, \ndedicated, loyal, and never complains.\u201d (AX D.)  \n \nAfter his contract ended, Applicant decided to take a vacation instead of returning \nimmediately to the United States. He knew that there were adverse tax consequences if \nhe stayed in the United States for more than 35 days, and so he decided to spend some \ntime sightseeing. (Tr. 151.) He spent  about ten days in Kyrgyzstan, accompanied by a \nwoman who was his barber and had become a friend. The woman was a native of \nKyrgyzstan and acted as his tour guide. Applicant stayed in a motel and the woman \nstayed with her parents. Applicant described the woman as a close friend, but he denied \nhaving a romantic or sexual relationship with her. (GX 5 at 6.) He disclosed his \nrelationship with the woman to his wife but did not mention her name. (GX 5 at 9.) \n \nApplicant took the opportunity to gamble in Kyrgyzstan and lost about $1,000. \n(GX 2 at 3.) He then visited his two uncles in Denmark for three days and traveled to the \n                                                          \n2 At the first hearing, Applicant\u2019s facility security officer testified he had in his possession a second SCA \nsubmitted by Applicant in 2008, but the 2008 SCA was not submitted as evidence. (September 2011 \nTranscript at 119.) \n \n3 At the first hearing, Department Counsel informed the Administrative Judge that the Government did not \nbelieve that the discrepancies in the SCA warranted an amendment of the SOR to allege intentional \nfalsification. (September 2011 Transcript at 123.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnited States, where he spent about two weeks with his wife. (GX 5 at 7.) He stopped \ngambling after his losses in Kyrgyzstan. (GX 5 at 10.) \n \n \nApplicant contacted a brother-in-law about opportunities for running a \nconstruction business in Afghanistan. After several discussions and a trip back to \nAfghanistan as a private citizen, Applicant abandoned the idea. (Tr. 82.)  \n \nWhen Applicant learned from a former supervisor that his current employer \nneeded linguists, he applied and was hired in January 2008. His current job does not \ninvolve duty with operational units outside the compound. It also offers vacation time \nthree times a year instead of once a year. He works at an entry-control point, screening \nlocal civilians seeking to enter the compound. Although he no longer works with \noperational units in the field, his compound is hit with mortar and rocket fire at irregular \nintervals, and the entry-control point is vulnerable to truck bomb attacks. (GX 5 at 7-8; \nTr. 82-88.) He testified that he does not leave the compound during his off-duty time \nbecause he is the \u201cfirst face\u201d at the gate and is likely to be recognized by \u201cbad guys\u201d \nwho have been denied entry or have been ejected. (September 2011 Transcript at 106-\n08.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, deceased since 1989, was a lieutenant colonel in the Pakistan \nArmy. Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Pakistan and is a permanent alien resident of \nthe United States. She spends about half her time in Pakistan and half in the United \nStates. (Tr. 92-93.) She is in poor health. Applicant calls her at least once a week. (Tr. \n97-98.)  \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Both are \nmarried to citizen-residents of Pakistan. His older brother is a lieutenant colonel in the \nPakistani Army. His younger brother worked for less than a year for the Pakistan \ngovernment in the equivalent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and then he was a \ncontractor for the United Nations in Pakistan, working on humanitarian projects. He is \nnow employed by a cell phone company. (GX 5 at 2; Tr. 130-31.) Applicant has contact \nwith his brothers about twice a year. (GX 5 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant has three sisters who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. One of his \nsisters is the vice-principal of a Christian convent school in Pakistan, one is a grammar \nschool teacher in Pakistan, and the third is married to a citizen and resident of Pakistan \nand does not work outside the home. A fourth sister is a citizen and resident of the \nUnited States, married to a U.S. citizen working in Afghanistan as a linguist. (Tr. 96-98.) \nHe has the most contact with the sister who is a grammar school teacher, because this \nsister cares for their mother in Pakistan. (GX 1 at 21-22; GX 5 at 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, now deceased, was a citizen of Germany. His mother-\nin-law is a German citizen permanently residing in the United States. She is in 82 years \nold and is cared for by Applicant\u2019s wife. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant maintains infrequent contact with a childhood friend who lives near the \nfamily home in Pakistan. He was employed by a Swedish cell phone company. (GX 5 at \n11.) This friend runs errands for Applicant\u2019s mother if one of Applicant\u2019s siblings is not \navailable. (Tr. 101.) \n \n \nA summary of a CI screening interview in August 2007 reflects that Applicant was \nconcerned about the deteriorating relationship with his wife due to their limited time \ntogether. (GX 10 at 3.) A summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) in April 2008 \nindicates that Applicant told the interviewer that he had \u201cfallen out of love\u201d with his wife \nand intended to file for divorce when he returned home in April 2008. It also indicates \nthat Applicant told the interviewer that he had established a \u201cromantic relationship\u201d with \na young, unmarried woman from Kyrgyzstan employed at Applicant\u2019s duty location as a \nbarber, that he talked to the woman daily, and they had \u201ca personal relationship that \nmay develop into something more serious.\u201d Finally, the PSI summary indicates that \nApplicant told the interviewer that he and his wife \u201cagreed to have an open relationship.\u201d \n(PSI attached to GX 8.)  \n \nWhen Applicant reviewed the PSI summary in response to DOHA interrogatories, \nhe took issue with the characterization with his relationship with the woman from \nKyrgyzstan. (GX 8 at 341.) He responded to the interrogatories by writing: \n \nIt is only dinners or sitting on the boardwalk together as you know males \nare not allowed to go to female tents as same females are not allowed to \nmale tents etc. It is romantic on base. That\u2019s right but it is not in USA. I do \nnot have any plans to go more than that if I would have I would have gone \nout of the way to Kyrgyzstan. I stopped there only when that was my route \nto home. \n \nAt the hearing, he testified that he was not comfortable with the term \u201cromantic \nrelationship,\u201d and the statement about the relationship developing into \u201csomething more \nserious\u201d was inaccurate. He also testified that his \u201copen relationship\u201d with his wife meant \nthat they talked to each other, not that they mutually agreed that each could have other \nsexual partners. (Tr. 158-59, 180.) He denied telling the interviewer that he was \u201cfalling \nout of love.\u201d (Tr. 162.) Finally, he testified that the woman from Kyrgyzstan left her job \u201ca \nfew months ago, and they have had no contact even though he has her email address. \n(Tr. 169.) He emphatically denied having a sexual relationship with the woman or even \nthinking about it. (Tr. 180, 81.) \n \nIn an affidavit dated January 13, 2010, Applicant admitted his prior comments \nabout his deteriorating marriage, but he explained that he felt it was unfair to his wife to \nhave a husband who returned home only once a year. He further explained that his \ncurrent employer permitted vacations every four months and, as a result, he and his \nwife had \u201creturned to normal,\u201d and they now had a strong, loving, and trusting marriage. \n(GX 2 at 3.) \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant denied that he married his wife so that he could obtain a visa to \nimmigrate to the United States. He testified that if that had been his motive, he would \nhave left her long ago instead of remaining married for 13 years. (Tr. 180.) \n \n \nThe summary of the August 2007 CI screening interview indicates that Applicant \nexpects to inherit property in Pakistan owned by his mother and grandparents. (GX 10 \nat 10.) At the hearing, Applicant stated the screening interview summary does not \nreflect what he said. He testified that his grandmother is deceased and he believes that \nthe property is owned by his uncle. (Tr. 135-37.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have a joint checking account, but they maintain separate \ncredit card accounts. He has three credit card accounts solely in his name, a joint \naccount with his mother, and a joint account with his older brother. (GX 2 at 2.) \nApplicant maintains the joint account with his older brother to enable him to make \npurchases for their mother. (Tr. 130.) \n \n \nThe vice-president of operations for Applicant\u2019s current employer, who also \ndirectly supervised Applicant for eight months in Afghanistan, is a retired federal \nemployee with 32 years of service in the intelligence and security fields, including 12 \nyears in the U.S. Marine Corps and 15 years as a civilian intelligence operations \nspecialist. He submitted a letter at the first hearing describing Applicant as the most \nconscientious and diligent interpreter on his staff. (AX A.) His letter included the \nfollowing comments: \n \n[Applicant] was quick to point out inconsistencies in applications, noted \nfabrications on official documents, and was able to recall security \nprotocols as mandated by command policies. [Applicant] took on a \npersonal obligation to ensure that all persons applying for [employment] \nwere doing so legitimately and correctly. [Applicant] was responsible for \nidentifying and effectively stopping several attempts by banned individuals \ntrying to circumvent our security processes. \n \n[Applicant has a high sense of patriotism to the United States. He has \nnever tolerated anyone to speak ill of his adopted country and would be \nthe first to squash any anti-American sentiment and would even escort the \noffender out the gate if so instructed. \n \nI have watched and managed many individuals who work in the \ncontracting world, but there are very few that are as committed as \n[Applicant] to the labor. He is not chasing a contractor\u2019s paycheck, he is \nlooking after his [contractor\u2019s] family and for the greater good of the lives \nof those who live and work at [the military installation]. \n \nHe testified at the second hearing and continued to support granting Applicant a \nsecurity clearance. He testified that he ranked Applicant first among eight linguists \nworking for him. He described Applicant as \u201cvery diligent, very studious, and exacting.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n \nHe pointed out that members of the team were vulnerable to vehicle bombs and rocket \nattacks, which occurred at least twice a month at irregular intervals. (Tr. 32-38.) \n \n \nThe current director of the project on which Applicant works has known him since \nOctober 2011. He characterized Applicant\u2019s performance as outstanding, based in part \nof the length of his experience on the job. He also recommended that Applicant receive \na security clearance. (Tr. 40-43.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, a fellow linguist, describes him as one of the \nmost reliable, hardworking, trustworthy, and logical linguists on the team. He notes that \nApplicant makes sound judgments, follows company policies and procedures \u201cwith a \npositive attitude,\u201d is attentive to details, takes his responsibilities seriously, and is \nextremely cautious in handling confidential tasks. (AX II-B.) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s fellow employees during the summer and winter of 2008 \ntestified that Applicant was dependable, straightforward, very skilled, loyal, and proud to \nbe from the United States. He also recommended that Applicant be granted a security \nclearance. (Tr. at 45-49; AX II-A.) \n \n \nA senior investigator who has worked with Applicant for the last four years \nsubmitted a statement describing him as dependable, professional, efficient, and \nextremely competent. He pointed out that on multiple occasions, Applicant was \nresponsible for obtaining and providing information that led to the apprehension or \ndetention of persons connected to the Taliban and anti-U.S and NATO forces. (AX B.) \n \n \nAnother senior investigator, who served on active duty in the U.S. Army for 24 \nyears, worked with Applicant from May 2009 through February 2011. He states that he \nwas initially suspicious of interpreters who were not native-born U.S. citizens, but that \nApplicant became his most trusted and respected employee. He considers Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness to be \u201cbeyond reproach.\u201d (AX II-C.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current project manager submitted a letter stating the Applicant has \nhis \u201ccomplete trust and confidence.\u201d He describes Applicant as punctual, dependable, \npurposeful, and transparent and forthcoming with peers, subordinates, and his \nsupervisor. He counts on Applicant \u201cto be the mantle of reason in a throng of haphazard \nopinions, and frequently, one of the few dissenting voices of moderation and restraint in \na roomful of extreme viewpoints.\u201d (AX C.) At the second hearing, the same project \nmanager submitted a document describing Applicant as \u201cthe quintessential flywheel in \nthe interview machinery\u201d who has been \u201cstanding the wall\u201d for five years for his \nemployer and NATO. (AX II-D.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors during September-November 2005 described how \nApplicant went beyond his translator duties by learning the tribal culture, developing \ninterview strategies, and creating charts and lists of words, terms, dates, and other \ninformation on the local culture and Islamic religion that could be used to identify \nindividuals with fake documents or who were sharing documents. He often developed \n\n \n9 \n \n \nforce protection information simply by watching and listening to the local work force. His \nsupervisors regarded him as \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d (AX E; AX F.) \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s cousins worked as linguists in the same compound where \nApplicant worked. One of his cousins holds a top secret clearance and worked with \nApplicant for about six months. He testified that Applicant was highly respected by his \nsupervisors, and he treated the Afghan citizens whom he interviewed with respect. He \ntestified that he would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d Applicant for a security clearance. (Tr. 52-\n59.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former facility security officer, retired after 24 years of service, \ntestified at the first hearing that Applicant\u2019s employer has continued to sponsor him for a \nclearance for more than three years because \u201c[h]e\u2019s just a very good employee.\u201d \n(September 2011 Transcript at 116.) Based on Applicant\u2019s reputation and long service \nwith the company, he recommended \u201cwithout reservation\u201d that Applicant be granted a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 71-73.) \n \n \nApplicant has received numerous certificates of appreciation during his service \nas a linguist. (AX G-J.) Most recently, in June 2012, he was commended by the \ncommander of the Expeditionary Detachment of the Air Force Office of Special \nInvestigations for his excellent performance of duty and outstanding character. (AX II-\nE.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice that Pakistan is a parliamentary federal \nrepublic with whom the United States has had diplomatic relations since 1947. Until \n1990, the United States provided substantial military aid to Pakistan, but it was \nsuspended as part of the sanctions imposed in response to Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons \nprogram. After September 11, 2001, the sanctions were suspended in recognition of \nPakistan\u2019s support for the U.S. campaign against terrorism, but its record in dealing with \nterrorists and militants has been mixed. It has persistently pursued militants it considers \ndangerous to Pakistan\u2019s interests, but it maintains its historical support of the Taliban \nand it considers militant groups to be important in its efforts to counter India\u2019s military \nand economic advantages. Al Qaeda, Taliban, and other militant groups use the \nloosely-controlled border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan as a safe haven. \nThe leader of the Taliban operates openly in Pakistan. The former leader of al Qaeda, \nOsama bin Laden, was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in May 2011. Travel to Pakistan \nis dangerous for U.S. citizens, because extremist groups in Pakistan target American \nand other Western interests, senior Pakistani officials, and members of minority \nindigenous and religious groups. Pakistan has a poor human rights record and suffers \nfrom wide-spread government corruption.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n\n \n10 \n \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n\n \n11 \n \n \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Pakistan, residing in \nPakistan about half the time and in the United States as a registered alien about half the \ntime (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It alleges that Applicant has two brothers who are citizens and \nresidents of Pakistan, one of whom is an officer in the Pakistani Army (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It \nalleges that Applicant\u2019s three sisters, one sister-in-law, one brother-in-law, and a \nchildhood friend are citizens and residents of Pakistan; and one brother-in-law is a \ncitizen of Pakistan residing in the United States as a registered alien (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \n1.e, and 1.h). It alleges that Applicant will inherit property in Pakistan upon the deaths of \nhis mother and grandmother (SOR \u00b6 1.f). It alleges that Applicant has a relationship with \na woman who is a citizen and resident of Kyrgyzstan and is employed in Afghanistan. \nFinally, it alleges that Applicant has borrowed a substantial sum of money from a cousin \nwho is a citizen of Pakistan and has also loaned this cousin a substantial sum of money. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i). \n \n \nThe evidence outlined above and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.d, 1.g, and 1.h. SOR \u00b6 1.e is not established, because the evidence shows that \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a U.S. citizen who is employed by a defense contractor and \nholds a security clearance. SOR \u00b6 1.f is not established because the sparse evidence of \nrecord indicates that the property is owned by Applicant\u2019s uncle who lives in Denmark. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is not established because the evidence shows that the cousin who borrowed \nmoney from Applicant and lent money to him is a U.S. citizen. \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \n\n \n12 \n \n \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of \nthe government, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a \nforeign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, \nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (e) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. The activities of al Qaeda, \nTaliban, and other military groups in Pakistan, the mixed record of Pakistan in dealing \nwith these groups, and recent tensions between Pakistan and the United States arising \nfrom direct U.S. actions against terrorists are sufficient to establish the \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (e).  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nWhere family ties to a foreign country are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). In this case, Applicant\u2019s multiple family members \nwho are residents and citizens of Pakistan, including his brother who is an officer in the \nPakistan Army, are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b). AG \u00b6 7(e) is not \nestablished, because Applicant refuted the allegation that he will inherit property in \nPakistan. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s older brother is a member of the \nPakistan Army. His younger brother, three sisters, two sisters-in-law, and a brother-in-\nlaw are citizens and residents of Pakistan. His mother, with whom he has an especially \nclose relationship, is a citizen of Pakistan and resides there about half the time.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s loyalty and obligation to his family members \nis not \u201cminimal,\u201d but I am satisfied that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the United States because of the depth of his relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates. Even though his father was an officer in the Pakistan Army and his brother is \ncurrently serving in the Pakistan Army, Applicant renounced his Pakistani citizenship, \nthereby risking estrangement from his brother. He has been married for more than 13 \nyears to a U.S. citizen. His mother, although a citizen of Pakistan, has ties to both the \nUnited States and Pakistan, because she has children in both countries. His family \nincludes a cadre of linguists supporting U.S. interests in Afghanistan. His sister, a U.S. \ncitizen, is married to a U.S. citizen who holds a security clearance and is deployed to \nAfghanistan as a linguist. His aunt and uncle, who treat Applicant as a son, are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens, hold security clearances, and are both deployed to \nAfghanistan. Two cousins have become U.S. citizens, obtained security clearances, and \ndeployed to Afghanistan. \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel did not argue that Applicant\u2019s relationship with a woman \nfrom Kyrgyzstan, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, had any independent security significance. \nInstead, Department Counsel argued that the relationship demonstrated the weakness \nof Applicant\u2019s marital relationship to a U.S. citizen. Applicant has repeatedly insisted \nthat his friendship with the woman was platonic. The only evidence to the contrary is the \ninvestigator\u2019s summary of a PSI, which refers to a \u201cromantic\u201d relationship and \nApplicant\u2019s expectation that the relationship might become more serious. Applicant \ndisagreed with the accuracy of the PSI summary in response to DOHA interrogatories, \ntwo affidavits, and at the hearing. I found his testimony, affidavits, and interrogatory \nresponses more persuasive than the second-hand PSI summary of what the \ninvestigator thought he said. Furthermore, to the extent that the friendship may have \nbeen inappropriate, it is over. Applicant had no contact with the woman after the 11-day \ntrip to Kyrgyzstan, and he testified that his marriage is strong. \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-distance courtship and short-notice wedding to an older woman \nmay have been unusual, but the question whether it was a sham marriage was resolved \nby U.S. immigration authorities 12 years ago. Furthermore, the strength of their \nmarriage is shown by the facts that they lived together from May 2000 until he deployed \nto Afghanistan in September 2005, they have endured long separations, and they are \nstill married after 13 years. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has recognized that linguists in a combat zone should be \nevaluated in the context of the high-risk environment in which many of them work. The \nAppeal Board has stated: \n \nAs a general rule, an applicant\u2019s prior history of complying with security \nprocedures and regulations is considered to be of relatively low probative \nvalue for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the security \nconcerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying conduct \nor circumstances. However, the Board has recognized an exception to \nthat general rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has \nestablished by credible, independent evidence that his compliance with \nsecurity procedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, \nhigh-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant \ncontribution to the national security. The presence of such circumstances \ncan give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to \nrecognize, resist, and report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or \nexploitation.  \n \nISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr 9. 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n \nThe Appeal Board also has recognized that protestations of loyalty to the United \nStates are of limited value unless an applicant has resisted indirect pressure by threats \nor coercion of family members in the past or \u201chas a previous track record of complying \nwith security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-risk \n\n \n15 \n \n \ncircumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008). \n \nApplicant has never held a clearance. However, he occupies a sensitive position \nand frequently deals with information having security significance. Investigators rely on \nthe accuracy of his translations during interviews and his meticulous and accurate \nexamination of documents for authenticity. He has a long track record of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and outstanding performance. \n \nApplicant has served in Afghanistan for more than six years, including five \nmonths in direct combat. He decided in October 2007 that he did not desire to continue \nserving in direct combat. He started working for his current employer in January 2008 in \na less dangerous environment, but he still serves in a combat zone, where he is \nvulnerable to random mortar and rocket attacks, truck bombs, and suicide bombers. He \nis a marked man among the \u201cbad guys\u201d who have been denied entry or ejected from the \ncompound. Since September 2005, he has performed his duties accurately and \ndiligently. He has a reputation for meticulous compliance with security procedures. As \nnoted by his direct supervisor for eight months, he is not \u201cchasing a contractor\u2019s \npaycheck.\u201d Instead, he safeguards his \u201cfamily\u201d of fellow contractor employees and those \nwho live and work at the military installation where he is assigned. He has gained the \nrespect and support of his current supervisors, who have kept him on the payroll without \na clearance for over three years because of his skill and reliability.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is applicable to Applicant\u2019s occasional contacts with his extended \nfamily and his childhood friend. It is not applicable to his infrequent contacts with his two \nbrothers or the two sisters who are not involved in caring for his mother, because he \nhas not overcome the rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family \nmember in a foreign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 1, 2002). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n16 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is well-educated, intelligent, and articulate. He speaks fluent English, \nbut it is still his second language, which accounts for his inaccurate descriptions of his \nfriendship with the woman from Kyrgyzstan. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the \nhearing. The testimony of senior officials who have supervised Applicant was \nimpressive. It is rare for defense contractors to continue to sponsor an applicant for five \nyears. The persistence of the Applicant\u2019s supervisors and their strong testimony is \ncompelling evidence of his trustworthiness and reliability.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to decide close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has  \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

Moreover, he \ndeliberately falsified his security clearance application. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 30, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nMay 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 6, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted or denied. \n \nApplicant\u2019s first response to the SOR allegations was incomplete and undated. \nHis second response is dated July 17, 2009. He elected to have his case decided on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), dated August 13, 2009, was provided to him by letter dated August \n21, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA transmittal letter on September 1, \n2009. He was given 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on November 3, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 2.a(2), and \n2.a(3). He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t, 1.w through 1.y, 2.a(1), and 2.b. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old security officer employed by a defense contractor. He \nserved in the U.S. Army from February 1967 until December 1969, achieved the pay \ngrade of E-4, and was honorably discharged (FORM Item 5). He attended college in \n1978-1979, for approximately one year. He worked as a state police officer from 1970 \nuntil 1990, and receives a retiree pension from that job. He married his wife in May \n1970, and they have been separated since 1998. He has four grown children, ages 37, \n34, 32, and 20. He pays his spouse\u2019s rent because his youngest son lives with her. \n \nApplicant and his wife filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1987. They \nwere having marital problems and separated. He could not afford to support the two \nseparate households, his debts became delinquent, and they filed for bankruptcy \nprotection to prevent foreclosure on their home. \n \nAfter his retirement from the state police, Applicant was unemployed for five \nmonths. In May 1990, he was hired by a protective agency as a security officer. In June \n1992 and June 1997, he was interviewed by Defense Investigative Service special \nagents, concerning a security clearance application related to his employment. In his \nJune 1992 statement (Item 8), Applicant explained his then financial problems as \nfollows: his retired pay was being garnished by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to \npay for back taxes he owed; he was making payments on a delinquent credit union \nloan, he explained the reasons behind an unpaid dental bill, and provided information \nabout an alleged pending settlement for an unpaid loan with another credit union. \n \nIn his June 1997 statement (Item 7), Applicant explained his then financial \nproblems which included: $44,800 in child support arrearages that were being paid \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthrough a $500 garnishment of his retired pay, a delinquent car loan with a credit union, \nand four tax liens for unpaid federal and state taxes from 1989 to 1994. He stated he \nacquired the tax debt when he was unemployed between jobs. He claimed that he and \nhis wife were making partial lump sum payments on their tax debts and that her pay \nchecks, and later her unemployment checks, were garnished to make partial payment \non their delinquent tax debts. Applicant stated: \u201cI\u2019m financially stable and I have learned \nthe hard way how important a stable financial situation is . . .\u201d (Item 7). In June 1998, \nApplicant was hired by his current employer, a defense contractor, who is sponsoring \nhis security clearance.  \n \nApplicant was late filing his federal income tax returns for 1992, 1993, 1994, \n1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2002. The IRS filed tax liens against him for every year \nexcept 1998. He eventually paid each of the liens. He has made one $300 payment for \n1998, and still owes over $32,000. He is delinquent on his state taxes for years 1998, \n1999, and 2000. A state tax lien for $16,593, was filed against him in April 2008, and \nremains unpaid (SOR \u00b6 1.s). \n \n \nAs of October 2009, Applicant had not filed his 1996, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, \n2005, 2006, and 2007 federal income tax returns. Federal law required him to file his \nfederal income tax returns by April 15th following the conclusion of each tax year, unless \nan extension was requested. Applicant was aware of his legal obligation to file his tax \nreturns on time and to pay his assessed income taxes. Notwithstanding, he chose not to \nobey the law. He knew he was going to owe taxes every year, so he did not bother to \ntimely file his tax returns or to pay his taxes. He waited for the IRS to file liens against \nhim and to garnish his wages to pay his past tax debts (Item 6, Aug. 28, 2008, response \nto the DOHA Interrogatories). As of August 2008, Applicant had a net income of $4,700; \nmonthly expenses of $3,359; and monthly debt payments of $630, for a net remainder \nof $710 (Item 6). \n \n \nApplicant denied he owed $31,600 for child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.t.). His \nFebruary and September 2008, and March 2009 credit reports list a child support \naccount (#1087) with a past due balance of $31,600. Records from a state Child \nSupport System, dated February 3, 2009, show that Applicant owed child support \narrearages in the approximate amount of $31,600. He averred that this child support \narrearage has been satisfied. However, his documents reference a different state child \nsupport collection account number. Applicant\u2019s evidence failed to establish that these \ntwo debts are the same child support obligation being collected by two different states. \n \n \nApplicant is indebted for a 2005 apartment fee in the approximate amount of \n$132 (SOR \u00b6 1.u.), and to a telephone provider in the approximate amount of $360 for a \ndebt that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.v.). He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.w, for \n$174, claiming he paid it. In his response to the SOR, he included a statement from a \ncollector concerning a post-dated check he issued to cover the debt. He denied the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.x, for $543, claiming he paid it; however, he provided no \ndocumentation to establish his claim. He resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y, for \n$641, in December 2007.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn his January 2008, clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to financial \nquestions asking whether in the last seven years - his wages had been garnished, he \nhad liens filed against him for failing to pay taxes or other debts, he had unpaid \njudgments, he had been 180 days delinquent on any debt, or if he was currently 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt (Item 4 Sections 27 and 28).  \n \nDuring his March 2008 follow-up interview with a government investigator \nconcerning his financial status, Applicant admitted that he was aware of the following \nfinancial problems: he had tax liens filed against him for unpaid taxes in November \n1991, October 1992, June 1995, April 1998, and September 2004; he had three \ndelinquent credit cards; owed unspecified taxes for 2007; and he acknowledge not \nbeing current on other debts as well.  \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he falsified his clearance \napplication, but claimed his falsification was not deliberate. Considering the evidence as \na whole, Applicant deliberately falsified his January 2008 security clearance application \nas alleged in the SOR.  \n \nIn his 1992 and 1997 statements, Applicant indicated he sought financial \ncounseling to resolve his then financial problems. He presented no evidence of any \nfinancial counseling thereafter. Applicant has performed well for government contractors \nand is a good employee. There is no evidence that Applicant has compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant expressed no remorse for his financial problems. He does not \nunderstand the importance of having and maintaining financial responsibility. Moreover, \nhis behavior shows lack of candor and reliability, and an unwillingness to comply with \nlegal requirements to pay debts.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. They provide \nexplanations for each guideline and list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s goal is to achieve a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d1 Once the \ngovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment.2 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to 1987, when he filed \nfor bankruptcy protection. Since 1991, he has been repeatedly delinquent in filing his \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfederal and state income tax returns and in paying his tax obligations. He owes a \nsignificant federal and state tax debt which is being involuntarily collected via \ngarnishments of pay. He failed to present documentary evidence to establish he is not \ndelinquent in his child support obligations. Additionally, he failed to pay three relatively \nsmall charged off debts, which have been delinquent for many years. \n \nApplicant presented little documentary evidence of good-faith efforts to pay, \nsettle, or resolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts;\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(g): \n\u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or fraudulent \nfiling of the same,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established some circumstances beyond his control, which contributed \nto his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his and his wife\u2019s periods of unemployment prior to \n1998, and his long-time separation from his wife. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but \ndoes not fully mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to \nshow he acted responsibly under the circumstances. The evidence clearly shows \nApplicant has been consistently employed since 1998. In light of his approximately $700 \nnet remainder after paying his day-to-day living expenses and garnishments, he failed \nto explain why he has not addressed his delinquent debts. He also failed to satisfactorily \n\n \n7 \n \n \nexplain his recalcitrant failure to file his tax returns and to timely pay his taxes. None of \nthe mitigating circumstances apply. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on his January 2008 security \nclearance application when he failed to disclose that since 1991, he had numerous \nfederal and state tax liens filed against him for his failure to file tax returns and to pay \nsufficient taxes. He also failed to disclose his tax debts to the IRS and a state, four other \ndelinquent debts, and that his wages had been garnished for years by the IRS. \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole-including his education, military and police \nexperience, his years working for government contractors, and maturity\u2013his statement \nthat his falsification was not deliberate is not credible. \n \nHis behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 16(a): \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits of status, determine \nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find none apply. Applicant \nfalsified his security clearance application. His falsification is a serious offense (felony-\nlevel),3 is relatively recent, and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. There is insufficient evidence of rehabilitation, counseling, or of steps taken \nto reduce his vulnerability to exploitation or duress. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n3 18 USC 1001. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served two and a half \nyears in the Army, retired from a state police force after 20 years of service, and worked \nfor government contractors since around 1990. He is a mature man and a good worker. \nThere is no evidence he has ever compromised or caused others to compromise \nclassified information. These factors show some responsibility, good judgment, and \nmitigation. Applicant also established some circumstances beyond his control, which \ncontributed to his inability to pay his debts.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has deliberately violated federal law with his \nrecalcitrant failure to timely file income tax returns and to pay his taxes when they \nbecame due. He also failed to resolve many other relatively small delinquent \nobligations. He presented little documentary evidence of debt payments, contacts with \ncreditors, or negotiations of debts. On the contrary, he waited for creditors to bring legal \naction against him and to garnish his wages to secure payment for Applicant\u2019s debts. \nHis favorable information fails to show financial responsibility and good judgment. \nApplicant expressed no remorse for his financial problems. He does not understand the \nimportance of having and maintaining financial responsibility. Moreover, Applicant \ndeliberately falsified his security clearance application when he failed to disclose his \nfinancial problems. His overall behavior shows lack of judgment, candor, and reliability, \nand an unwillingness to comply with the law.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.v, and  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n   1.x: \n \nSubparagraphs 1.w and 1.y:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On September 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nMay 29, 2009\n\nItem 2 (Response to SOR); Item 3.\n1\nItem 2, supra note 1; Item 4 (e-QIP).\n2\nId.\n3\nItem 5 (Interrogatories and attachments).\n4\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 16, 2008. He\nsubmitted a notarized, written response to the SOR allegations on November 1, 2008,\nand requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing.1\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on February 12, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nMarch 2, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response or\nadditional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on May 15, 2009. The government\nsubmitted seven exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-7 and admitted into the\nrecord. Item 2 of the government\u2019s exhibits is Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 1, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d and 1.f of the SOR, with explanations. He\ndenied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, and 2.a of the SOR. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 35 years old, works as a logistics co-ordinator for a Department\nof Defense contractor, a position he has held since 2006. He served on active duty in\nthe United States Air Force for four years and in the state Air Guard for more than\nseven years. He received an honorable discharge from both.2\nApplicant and his wife married in 1996 and they have three sons, ages 11, 7, and\n4. After his discharge from active duty in 1997, Applicant worked several different\ncivilian jobs, which did not pay a salary commensurate with his military pay. As a result,\nhe experienced difficulty in paying his bills. He enlisted in the Air Guard to help stabilize\nhis income and work closer to home. Before accepting his present job, Applicant again\nworked various low paying civilian jobs for a short period of time.3\nApplicant currently earns $102,000 a year. His gross monthly income totals\napproximately $8,500 and his net monthly income totals approximately $7,000. His\nmonthly expenses, including his mortgage and two car payments, total approximately\n$5,000, leaving $2,000 for other expenses and repayment of debt. Applicant\u2019s credit\nreports reflect that he pays his current bills on time and that he has paid many of his\ndebts in a timely manner in the past. He lives within his financial means.4\n\nItem 1 (SOR); Item 2, supra note 1, attachments; Item 6 (Credit Report, dated October 31, 2006) at 9; Item\n5\n7 (Credit report, dated August 21, 2008) at 3.\nItem 2, supra note 1; Item 5, supra note 4; Item 7 supra note 5.\n6\n3\nThe SOR alleges $90,470 in unpaid debts based on credit reports dated October\n31, 2006 and August 21, 2008. The largest debt relates to an unpaid mortgage debt of\n$79,130. Applicant verified that this debt is fully paid and he does not owe any money to\nthis creditor. The SOR also indicates that Applicant is $1,000 past due on his current\nmortgage, although this debt is not listed on either credit report. Both credit reports\nverify that this mortgage debt is an account in good standing and the creditor does not\nshow any past due amount on the loan. Both of these debts are resolved.5\nApplicant denies the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a, a telephone bill from 2000, and\n1.e, an unidentified $125 medical bill from 2003. He acknowledged the $50 medical bill\nin SOR \u00b6 1.b. In his interview with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninvestigator in September 2007, Applicant acknowledged the telephone debt and\nindicated the medical bills belonged to his wife. He told the investigator that both\nmedical accounts had been paid, one in July 2006 and the other in June 2007. In his\nresponse, Applicant indicated the telephone company no longer existed and the\ncollection agent could not find an account in his name. He also indicated that the\nsmaller medical bill had been submitted to the insurance company and the medical\noffice had cancelled the debt. These three debts are not shown on the August 21, 2008\ncredit report. Because the medical bills are no longer on his credit report and his\nstatements about the payment of these debts are consistent, I find that the two medical\nbills are paid.\nApplicant acknowledges he owed a car loan debt on an automobile his wife\nwrecked in a car accident, but believed the debt had been resolved as the creditor again\nloaned him money to buy a car in 2005. In his response, he submitted a letter which\nshows that his present car loan with the same creditor is current. The account number\non his current car loan is not the same as the account number on the unpaid car loan\ndebt. Applicant has not provided any information which shows that this four year old\ndebt is paid or being resolved. This account is not listed on the August 21, 2008 credit\nreport. While he was in another area of the country for training, his wife failed to pay the\nrent on an apartment she rented. In his response, he indicated the debt had been\nsatisfied, but he could not verify this information. This 2001 debt is not shown on the\nAugust 21, 2008 credit report.6\nApplicant completed his E\u2013QIP on October 19, 2006. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nfollowing questions:\nQuestion 28. Your Financial Delinquencies   \na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n\nItem 2, supra note1; Item 5, supra note 4.\n7\n4\nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?\nApplicant denies that he intentionally falsified these answers. At the time he\ncompleted his E-QIP, Applicant believed the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d and 1.e\nbelonged to his wife and he was unaware that any debts were in collection. He admits\nhe knew about the car loan, but believed it had been settled and was not an issue. In\nhis answers to interrogatories, he stated that he was unaware of any debts in collection.\nThe OPM investigator did not discuss his answers to these questions during the\ninterview.7\n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n5\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt in the past, which he\ndid not pay for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ While some of\nhis debts occurred some time ago, Applicant did not present evidence which shows that\nhis debts occurred under unusual circumstances which are not likely to reoccur in the\nfuture. This mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant has not\n\nBased on their age, these debts are barred from collection under the State Statute of Limitations.\n8\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not raised in this case.\n9\n6\nprovided any evidence which demonstrates that events beyond his control created his\npast financial problems. I find this mitigating condition is not applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not sought or received financial\ncounseling. However, the evidence of record reflects that his usual finances are under\ncontrol. His monthly income is sufficient to cover his monthly expenses and provides\nadditional income to cover unexpected expenses each month. Both credit reports reflect\nthat over the years he has paid the majority of his debts in a timely manner. This\nmitigating condition is partially applicable.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ndemonstrated that the large mortgage debt is resolved and that his monthly mortgage\npayment is current. While the August 2008 credit report does not show any overdue\ndebts, except the paid mortgage debt, Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence\nthat the rent, telephone and car debts are resolved. The rent debt and the telephone\ndebt are eight and nine years old respectively  and were most likely removed from the\n8\ncredit report due to age. Without more documentary evidence, I am unable to conclude\nthat these debts are resolved. The two medical bills are more recent and not likely to\nhave been removed from the credit report for age. Rather, Applicant\u2019s statements that\nthese debts are resolved are paid supports an inference that these debts are paid. I\nconclude this mitigating condition applies to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d through\n1.g.9\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 07-08925 (App. Bd. Sept. 15, 2008); ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17,\n10\n2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating condition\n11\nAG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the\nallegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n7\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s falsification must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from his e-QIP when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Section 28 a and b about his past due debts. This information is\nmaterial to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and\nto his honesty. In his response, he denies, however, that he had an intent to hide\ninformation about his finances. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the\ngovernment has the burden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an\nomission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record\nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence\nconcerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.10\nApplicant denied intentionally leaving out information about his overdue debts. At\nthe time, he completed his SF-86, none of his current debts were more than 90 days\npast due. Thus, he did not falsify his answer to Question 28 b.  Concerning his \u201cno\u201d\nanswer to Question 28 a, Applicant\u2019s failure to answer \u201cyes\u201d about his past debts is not\nproof that he intentionally falsified his e-QIP. He knew about the unpaid car loan when\nhe completed his e-QIP, but thought it was resolved. He did not know about the other\ndebts listed in his credit, three of which he believed belonged to his wife. Based on his\nbeliefs, the government has not established that Applicant intended to hide his financial\nsituation from the government. His belief, although mistaken, does not reflect intentional\nconduct on his part. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.11\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n8\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The major debt listed in the SOR is\nresolved. Applicant\u2019s financial statement indicates that he has sufficient income each\nmonth to pay his monthly expenses and has additional financial resources for\nunexpected expenses. He, however, has not provided sufficient information to explain\nhow the remaining significant debts occurred. He has not shown that circumstances\nbeyond his control caused these debts or that he has made an effort to resolve the\ndebts. He needs to provide documentary evidence to show that these debts are\nresolved. Although he has not actually proven his debts are resolved, his belief at the\ntime he completed his e-QIP that his debts were not an issue is sufficient to establish\nthe lack of intent to falsify his answers on his security clearance application.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",
