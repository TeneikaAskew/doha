Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 2, 2022, the Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement. The SOR explained why the CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance eligibility. The CAF took \nthe action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn June 13, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR.

On August 5, 2022, Department Counsel prepared a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of a brief, together with eight supporting \nexhibits. In addition, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to include three \nallegations under the Personal Conduct guideline, annotated as subparagraphs 2.a through \n2.c. (FORM at 2) Applicant received the FORM on August 22, 2022, and provided a \nresponse by August 23. 2022. In his response, Applicant admitted subparagraphs 2.a and \n2.b, and denied subparagraph 2.c. (Response at 1) On October 31, 2022, the case was \nassigned to me.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 34-year-old, married man with one child, age nine, He served in the \nU.S. Navy from 2011 to 2016. He was honorably discharged. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in information technology in 2019, and a master\u2019s degree in information assurance \nand cybersecurity in 2021. (Response at 3) He has been working for a defense contractor \nsince 2017. (Item 5 at 14) \nApplicant has been using marijuana with varying degrees of frequency since 2007. \nFor the first three to four years of his use, he periodically sold marijuana. (Item 6 at 2; Item \n8 at 10) Applicant stopped using marijuana while he was in the Navy and resumed use in \n2018. Since then, he typically either smokes it or uses it in candy form. He typically uses it \nwith his wife. (Items 7 at 6; 8 at 9) He enjoys using marijuana, contending that it helps him \nmanage anxiety, helped him quit smoking tobacco, and makes him \u201cfeel relaxed, like [he] \nfeels when he drinks two beers, but without the weight gain.\u201d (Item 7 at 6) Over the years, \nhe has used it approximately 300 times. \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in March 2022, approximately four years after \nhe completed a security clearance application, and four days before he was scheduled for \nan interview with an investigative agent. (Item 7 at 5) At that time, he was using marijuana \napproximately once per week. (Item 7 at 5) In response to a question on the March 2022 \ninterrogatories regarding future illegal marijuana use, Applicant responded, as follows: \nI have no details, but I figure it\u2019s better to err on the side of the affirmative. \nThe national culture is shifting and all but the top seems to be moving with it. \n5mg or 2 beers doesn\u2019t make much difference since I don\u2019t leave my house \neither way. (Item 7 at 9) \nIn response to subparagraph 1.c alleging that Applicant intends to continue using marijuana \nin the future, he denied it, explaining that he does not have a plan in place to continue \nusing marijuana, but was \u201cnot against\u201d using it in the future, and \u201cwouldn\u2019t use it, at least, \nfor a while.\u201d (Item 3 at 2) \nApplicant believes the current classification of marijuana under federal law as a \nSchedule I drug with a high potential for abuse is \u201cridiculous,\u201d and the presumption that use \nof marijuana constitutes \u201csuch a danger that [he] can\u2019t be trusted by using it is incorrect[,] \nand . . . the majority of the developed world would agree\u201d with him.

(Response at 1) \nApplicant has a medical disability that results in severe neck pain, for which he is \nprescribed a combination of anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxers. (Item 3 at 1) \nIn 2019, his prescription was delayed in the mail. Subsequently, Applicant experienced \nextreme pain, compelling him to use one of his mother\u2019s prescription pain relievers, on one \noccasion, to get it under control. (Item 3 at 1; Item 6 at 3) \nShortly before Applicant entered the Navy in 2011, he completed a security \nclearance application. He did not include his purchase, sale, and use of marijuana on the \napplication, as required, and as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. Applicant \ncontends that he told his recruiter who advised him to \u201ckeep it to [him]self.\u201d (Response at 1) \n Applicant completed a security clearance application in 2018. SOR subparagraph \n2.c alleges that he underreported his marijuana use by not disclosing his use in 2007 in \nresponse to Section 23 of the application requiring disclosure of illegal drugs within the past \nseven years preceding completion of the application. Applicant answered \u2018Yes,\u2019 to this \nquestion, disclosing that his most recent use was approximately seven months before \ncompletion of the application.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel[.]\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nUnder AG \u00b6 24, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant used a prescription painkiller not prescribed to him on one occasion \nafter his prescription was delayed in the mail, leaving him in extreme pain. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u2019 applies.\u201d I resolve \nsubparagraph 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nConversely, Applicant\u2019s longstanding and habitual use of marijuana, including his \noccasional purchase of it over the years, and his failure to unequivocally stop using \nmarijuana triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c), \n\u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d Applicant was smoking \nmarijuana habitually as recently as four days before his subject interview. He is nonchalant \nabout the fact that it remains illegal under federal law, contending that it does not reflect \nnegatively on his character. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions \napply. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concern. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201c[o]f special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant admits falsifying a 2011 security clearance application by failing to disclose \nhis drug involvement. This triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant completed this application as \npart of the enlistment process for joining the Navy. He told his recruiter about his drug \ninvolvement and was told not to include it on the security clearance application. This \nexplanation potentially triggers the application of the following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17(b): \nThe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation triggers the first prong of AG \u00b6 17(b). However, he never shared \nthis information until he answered the amended SOR in response to the FORM. \nConsequently, the second prong of AG \u00b6 17(b) is inapplicable. \nApplicant falsified this information more than 12 years ago. Since then, he has \ncompleted another security clearance application, disclosing his marijuana use. Moreover, \nhe has been forthcoming about how often he has used marijuana, the likelihood that he will \ncontinue using it, and how much he enjoys it. In addition, he has readily shared his opinion \nabout the current federal marijuana law and his belief that there is no nexus between \ncharacter and illegal marijuana use. Under these circumstances, I conclude lack of candor \nand dishonesty are not at issue, and that although Applicant falsified his 2011 security \nclearance application at the behest of his recruiter, it no longer generates a current security \nconcern. I resolve subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSubparagraph 2.c alleges that Applicant answered \u2018yes\u2019 on a 2018 security \nclearance application requiring applicants to disclose any drug use within seven years of \ncompleting the application, but that he deliberately underreported the amount of use by \nfailing to discuss the number of times he used marijuana between 2007 and 2011. The \nquestion only requires applicants to disclose drug use within seven years of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \napplication\u2019s completion. Consequently, Applicant was not required to list any drug use \nduring that time frame. I conclude that his response to this question does not generate a \nsecurity concern. I resolve subparagraph 2.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. In reaching this \nconclusion, I also considered the candor with which he has discussed his involvement with \nmarijuana throughout the investigative process, as discussed in my analysis on \nsubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. In sum, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the personal \nconduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nAIthough marijuana use has been decriminalized in several states, it remains illegal \nunder federal law. As such, Applicant\u2019s opinion that marijuana should be legal has no \nbearing on whether his longtime use should be mitigated. To the contrary, it reflects a \nwillingness to pick and choose which law to obey based on opinion. As such, it disqualifies \nApplicant from security clearance consideration. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a -2.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

On August 8, \n2023, Applicant answered the amended SOR. Applicant waived the 15-day notice \nrequirement, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 8. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through N. \nApplicant objected to portions of GE 8, the personal summary of interview, and made \ncorrections that are noted in the exhibit. There were no other objections and, all exhibits \nwere admitted in evidence as amended. DOHA received the hearing transcript on August \n25, 2023.

She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. She earned some college credits but not a degree. She \nmarried in 2007 and divorced in 2010. She remarried in 2012. She has six children \nranging from 20 years old to 5 years old. She has worked for a federal contractor since \n2006 and has held a security clearance since then. (Tr. 33-37; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that her family has a history of mental health issues. Due to the \nstigma associated with mental illness in the past, she was raised by her family to deny \nthe issues if a problem existed because it was embarrassing and brought shame on the \nfamily. Applicant testified that she was in denial for years about her mental health \nproblems.

She believed she never was properly treated for her more serious mental \nhealth issues because of the misdiagnosis and her state of denial. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant testified that she began consuming alcohol in about 2002. She never \nconsumed alcohol while she was pregnant or breast feeding. In 2004, she was working \nas a bartender and the management encouraged the bartenders to let customers buy \nthem drinks to increase business. She said she would often get drunk while working at \nthe bar. After she married in 2006, she moved to a new state with her husband, and she \ndid not consume alcohol because she was at home and did not socialize. Gradually she \nmade friends and became more social. She testified that she never felt like she needed \nor craved alcohol but when she did drink, she had no control and could not stop. She \nfound her body reacted differently when she consumed alcohol than it does for other \npeople, in that instead of acting as a depressant, it energized her. (Tr. 45-49) \nApplicant testified that after she remarried, she and her husband both drank \nalcohol, and it would fuel fights between them. In 2016, while talking on the phone with a \nfriend, she consumed a 750 ml bottle of rum. Her husband was in bed and got up and \nconfronted her. She was belligerent. She blacked out and does not recall what happened \nbut was told she was combatant with her husband and her father who had been contacted \nand came to their house. (Tr. 39-41) \nApplicant was taken to CC, a hospital, and was admitted to the behavioral unit \nwhere she stayed for three days. She described the facility as horrible, and she was \nterrified while there. She was placed in a room with a woman who talked to herself and \nwas told that the woman was aggressive. Applicant testified she met with a psychiatrist \nfor five minutes. There was concern that because there were scratches on her wrists that \nshe had made a suicide attempt. The scratches were superficial. This was also fueled by \nthe fact that her husband could not find his medication, and it was believed she had \nconsumed it. She denied she attempted to commit suicide. All of her toxicology tests were \nnegative, and her husband eventually found his medication, refuting that she made a \nsuicide attempt. (Tr. 39-41, 47; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that her experience with the medical personnel raised concerns \nabout the quality of the facility. She said she met with a nurse practitioner who vaped \nduring her entire interview. She was prescribed Zoloft and the nurse believed because \nApplicant had a busy life with five children at the time that she was suffering from post-\npartum depression. Applicant testified that she believed she did have depression after \nher child was born, but it was not to the level of post-partum. She also candidly admitted \nthat she was in denial on acknowledging she had other serious mental health issues. She \nmet with a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, with depressed \nmood, and alcohol intoxication delirium, with mild use disorder. After her release from the \nunit, she felt good but continued to consume alcohol. She did not believe at that time that \nshe had a problem with alcohol. She attributed her diagnoses to others who believed that \nshe had swallowed pills, despite evidence to the contrary. Applicant continued to take \nZoloft which helped her.

She also discontinued \ntaking the Zoloft upon her obstetrician\u2019s recommendation. She did not consult with any \nother doctors about the consequences of stopping Zoloft. Her son was born in July 2018 \nand Applicant nursed him until February 2019. She experienced stress due to the baby \nhaving some special medical needs, some financial issues, and she was not on any \nmedication. When she stopped breast-feeding, she started to drink alcohol again. She \nalso explained after the lockdown due to the pandemic the children were all home, and it \nwas also more stressful. (Tr. 42-44, 57-60) \nApplicant testified that once she starts to drink alcohol, she does not have control. \nShe becomes belligerent and argumentative. From February 2019 to April 2020, she \nconsumed alcohol sporadically but when she did, it was to intoxication. Her husband tried \nto limit her to three drinks, but she said she threw the restriction back at him because he \nconsumed alcohol and said that he had the problem with alcohol and not her. She \nadmitted they were both in denial regarding their problems with alcohol. (Tr. 44-46, 60-\n61) \nIn April 2020, Applicant and her family were celebrating her daughter\u2019s birthday. \nApplicant was consuming alcohol. She was upset at her husband for spending money for \nsomething she did not approve of. Later in the evening, she and her husband were \narguing. Applicant testified she blacked out and does not remember what happened. She \nonly knows what was told to her. She called the police and accused her husband of hitting \nher son, which was not true. The police came, and her husband went to his mother\u2019s \nhouse. Her mother stayed with her and the children. Applicant went to take a shower and \nher mother-in-law came over to the house to retrieve Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s medication. \nBecause Applicant had been in the bathroom for a long time and was unresponsive, her \nson unlocked the door. Applicant was on the floor and was blue. An ambulance was \ncalled, and she was taken to the hospital and intubated. It was determined that she had \ntaken her husband\u2019s entire prescription of Xanax and some hydrocodone that had been \nprescribed to her after an operation. (Tr. 51, 61-64) \nApplicant testified she woke up in the hospital a few days later unaware of what \nhad transpired or how long she had been in the hospital. She was then transferred to the \nbehavior wing at RL, a hospital. She met with a psychiatrist and a therapist for the three \ndays she was there. She discussed with the psychiatrist her family history and what had \nhappened. He explained to her that her condition was not temporary and would not go \naway. He explained that they needed to fix her brain, and she would be on medication for \nthe rest of her life. He specifically said she was not suffering from post-partum depression. \nInstead, he diagnosed her with Major Depressive Disorder. She was put back on Zoloft, \nwhich has provided good results. She said she was sad and angry because she blamed \nher family for teaching her to deny mental health issues and leave them untreated. She \nexplained that her grandmother had committed suicide and she later learned her aunt has \nthe same diagnoses as her. (Tr. 64-68, 89-90; GE 4; AE A, B, N) \nApplicant recognizes that her use of alcohol exacerbated her other mental health \nissues. She testified that her current diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder severe \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout psychotic episodes and she is also being treated for Alcohol Use Disorder. The \npsychiatrist at RL referred Applicant to her primary care doctor for medicine management \nof her Zoloft dosage. Since April 2020, Applicant\u2019s dosage has increased from 50mg to \n100mg and in late 2022 it was increased again to 150mg when Applicant was \nexperiencing stress due to her security clearance being under review. The increases were \nall under the care of her doctor. (Tr. 69-71, 91-92, 95-96; GE 4; AE B, N) \nWhile at RL, Applicant also met with a psychologist and was to meet with her for a \nyear. She did not have a good rapport with her. She participated in talk therapy and initially \nthey met twice a week, then once a week, then bi-weekly. Applicant discontinued seeing \nthe psychologist because she did not find it helpful, and they would often sit together and \nnot talk. She stopped seeing the psychologist around June or July 2020. She continued \nto take her medicine as prescribed. She admitted that she was not happy with the care \nshe had initially received at CC where the psychologist was affiliated because she \nbelieved they mishandled her care. She tried to meet again with the psychiatrist from RL \nwho diagnosed her, but he had left the hospital\u2019s employment and she was unable to \narrange an appointment. (Tr. 68-69, 71-74, 77, 92-94; GE 3, 4; AE A, B, N) \nBefore being discharged from RL, Applicant worked on a recovery plan with the \npsychiatrist and his nurse. Her family participated in the discussions regarding support \nthrough a virtual meeting to ensure everyone was aware of it. Almost immediately after \nApplicant\u2019s discharge from RL, she began participating in \u201cIn the Room.\u201d This is an online \ntreatment program that offers Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and other activities \nthat are always available. She learned about this group while at RL. Her recovery was \nhappening during the pandemic, so the use of online groups was the norm. Also, it \nallowed her flexibility to seek a meeting when it met her schedule as there are meetings \noffered every two hours. The AA program required that she attend meetings for 90 \nconsecutive days. AA offered meetings, communicating with others, reflections, and \nsponsors. There is also a subdivision at \u201cIn the Room\u201d that offers a community for those \nwith more than one diagnosis. The group is called Dual Diagnoses. Applicant feels very \ncomfortable participating in this community because it is not just about being addicted to \nalcohol but also addresses other mental health diagnoses. Applicant works on the 12-\nsteps of AA and has a sponsor. When she first started, she participated more often in the \ngroup, but the frequency has been reduced now that her mental health and alcohol issues \nare under control. She continues to participate in the program. She continues to be \nmedication compliant, reads the daily reflections from the group and posts her gratitudes \nweekly. (Tr. 74-83, 94, 98; AE M) \nApplicant testified that she has a robust support group. Her husband supports her \nsobriety. After Applicant\u2019s hospitalization, he was in denial about his alcohol problem, but \nin about June 2020, he recognized that he too is an alcoholic. They support each other. \nThere is no alcohol in the house. Both testified that Applicant has not consumed alcohol \nsince the April 2020 incident and hospitalization. Applicant\u2019s family and her husband\u2019s \nfamily live close by and are there to support her. She has a church community and is \ninvolved as a girl scout leader with her daughters. She recognizes triggers that may raise \nconcerns and addresses them immediately. Her husband is also vigilant in monitoring her \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmoods and stresses.

(Tr. 85-86) \nDue to the stress associated with the retention of her security clearance, Applicant \nwent to see a therapist in August 2022 to help her. She participated in cognitive therapy \nwith him. He gave her the same diagnoses as noted above. He is a licensed clinical social \nworker. She saw him until January 2023. (Tr. 84-85) \nApplicant reported her 2016 hospitalization incident to her employer\u2019s facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) but was told because it was due to post-partum depression she \nwas not required to do so. She reported her April 2020 incident to her FSO. She admitted \nthat when she completed her security clearance application in March 2020, she did not \ndisclose alcohol or mental health issues because she was in denial. (Tr. 99-100; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s coworker for the past 13 years and friend testified on her behalf. She \nis aware of Applicant\u2019s mental health hospitalizations and addiction to alcohol. She did \nnot observe Applicant drink alcohol when they were at a company happy hour. She \ndescribed Applicant as reliable, trustworthy, dependable, always willing to help, and a \nvital member of the team. (Tr. 105-109) \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law testified. She was aware that in the past Applicant was \ndiagnosed with post-partum depression. Since April 2020 she has never observed \nApplicant consume alcohol. She is available, as is her whole family that lives very close, \nto provide any support Applicant may need. She has noticed a change in Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior since she has abstained from alcohol consumption. Applicant is calm and \norganized. She describes Applicant as a loving mother, daughter, and aunt. She has \nfound new hobbies and is very involved in girl scouts with her daughters, is a homeroom \nparent, gardens, and is enrolled in college. (Tr. 109-115) \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified and acknowledged that since both have stopped \nconsuming alcohol, their marriage and life has improved. He described himself as a \nrecovering alcoholic. He is aware that his wife recognizes her triggers that may impact \nher mental health. He believes the last alcohol episode in April 2020, where she almost \ndied, scared her about what could have happened. She is managing her mental health \nthrough medication. She has constant family support, and they support each other. (Tr. \n115-122) \nApplicant provided her excellent performance evaluations and performance goals \nfrom her employer. She is committed to her sobriety and mental health. She intends to \nremain vigilant in taking her prescribed medication and recognizing triggers that may \nimpact her mental health.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant consumed alcohol from 2002 to 2020, at times in excess and to the point \nof intoxication. In December 2016, she was hospitalized after consuming a bottle of rum \nand admitted to a behavioral unit for care. She was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with \nadjustment disorders, with depressed mood and alcohol intoxication delirium, with mild \nuse disorder. In April 2020, after consuming alcohol, she was involved in an incident at \nher home and ingested Xanax and hydrocodone in an attempt to commit suicide. She \nwas found unconscious and was hospitalized. The evidence supports the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol consumption since April 2020 and is \ncommitted to never drinking alcohol again. She has been sober for more than three years \nwith no recurrence of alcohol-related problems. She acknowledges she was in denial \nabout her alcohol abuse and mental health issues for many years. S\n he is on medication \nto address her mental health issues, which were exacerbated by her alcohol abuse and \nvice versa. She is compliant with her medication management. Although she discontinued \nseeing a psychologist for counseling, she sought other support. She participates in AA as \npart of \u201cIn the Room\u201d and a subgroup Dual Diagnosis. She is aware of her triggers and \nseeks help when she feels stress, which she did recently. Her husband and close family \nmembers provide her support. Her alcohol abuse and mental health problems cannot be \nseparated. Once she was properly diagnosed and provided the proper medication for her \nmental health, she has been able to manage and abstain from alcohol. Although there \nare never guarantees regarding alcohol and mental health issues, I found Applicant \ncredible in her commitment to abstention and managing her mental health now that she \nis properly diagnosed. I find future issues are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubts on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b623(a), 23(b) and 23(c) \napply. AG \u00b6 23(d) partially applies because although she has demonstrated an \nestablished pattern of abstinence, she has not completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare.  \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend counseling sessions. \nApplicant was hospitalized in December 2016 and diagnosed by a psychiatrist with \nadjustment disorders, with depressed mood and alcohol intoxication delirium. She was \nhospitalized again in April 2020 for an alcohol incident and drug ingestion in a suicide \nattempt. During this hospitalization she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent severe, without psychotic features by a psychiatrist. She was to participate in \ncounseling with a psychologist for a year but discontinued it because it was not helpful. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nThe same analysis under the Guideline G mitigation is applicable under this \nguideline. Additional analysis is provided. Applicant admitted she was in denial for years \nabout her mental health issues due to being taught that these issues should not be \nacknowledged. In addition, her mental health condition was misdiagnosed for years \nattributing her problems to post-partum depression. She now has a correct diagnosis. \nShe acknowledges she will have to manage her condition with medication for the rest of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher life.

AG \u00b6 29(a) applies. \nApplicant did not follow through on counseling with a psychologist after her release \nfrom RL in 2020 because she did not feel it was helpful. However, she immediately began \nparticipating in AA through \u201cIn the Room\u201d and participated in the subgroup for Dual \nDiagnoses. She continues to participate in both but not to the extent she previously did \nas her condition is under control and managed. She has not received a favorable \nprognosis from a mental health professional. AG \u00b6 29(b) partially applies. \nApplicant\u2019s condition is not temporary, but she now has an accurate diagnosis, and \nher mental health is stable and she no longer shows signs of instability. AG \u00b6 20(d) \npartially applies. There is no indication of a current problem. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse.  \nIn April 2020, Applicant used her husband\u2019s Xanax and misused hydrocodone \nthat was prescribed to her after surgery. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . .. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe same analyses under Guidelines G and I apply under this guideline. Applicant \nused her husband\u2019s prescription Xanax and misused her prescription for hydrocodone \nafter consuming alcohol. Her actions are related to mental conditions and alcohol abuse \ndisorder. These conditions are now under control as she abstains from alcohol \nconsumption and her mental health conditions are managed through medication. This \none-time occurrence happened more than three years ago, under unique circumstances \nand is unlikely to recur. She acknowledged her misuse of the drugs and there has been \nno recurrence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, H and I, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant recognizes that she must remain on medication for the rest of her life. It \ntook years for her to receive a proper diagnosis, partly because she was in denial. She is \nnow stable and cognizant of what is required to remain so. She has a strong support \nsystem. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption, Guideline I, psychological conditions, and Guideline H, drug involvement \nand substance misuse. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nWITHDRAWN \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

He has not been married and has no children. He served on active reserve duty with the U.S. Air Force from 2005 to 2013 and received an honorable discharge. (Items 3, 8) Applicant has a history of mental health issues and inpatient hospitalizations. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and unspecified psychotic disorder by a duly qualified mental health professional. His mental-health disorders cause periods of psychosis where he suffers from delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and memory loss. He began experiencing these symptoms in about 2010. (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) In late November 2019, Applicant checked himself into an inpatient hospital for mental health treatment because he was suffering from an increase in audio-visual hallucinations, high anxiety, and insomnia. During this inpatient treatment, he reported that, for years, he had been misusing prescription Xanax and prescription Ambien by taking more than the amount he was prescribed. He also reported that he had been binge drinking about a pint of liquor one to two times per week to help him sleep. According to his medical records form this hospital, combining alcohol with several of the prescription drugs he was taking is a misuse of those prescription drugs.

The case was assigned to me on May 9, 2023. The \nGovernment exhibits included in the FORM (Items 1-8) are admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has \nworked since October 2019. He received a high school diploma in 2003. He has not \nbeen married and has no children. He served on active reserve duty with the U.S. Air \nForce from 2005 to 2013 and received an honorable discharge. (Items 3, 8) \nApplicant has a history of mental health issues and inpatient hospitalizations. He \nhas been diagnosed with schizophrenia and unspecified psychotic disorder by a duly \nqualified mental health professional. His mental-health disorders cause periods of \npsychosis where he suffers from delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and memory loss. \nHe began experiencing these symptoms in about 2010. (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) \nIn late November 2019, Applicant checked himself into an inpatient hospital for \nmental health treatment because he was suffering from an increase in audio-visual \nhallucinations, high anxiety, and insomnia. During this inpatient treatment, he reported \nthat, for years, he had been misusing prescription Xanax and prescription Ambien by \ntaking more than the amount he was prescribed. He also reported that he had been \nbinge drinking about a pint of liquor one to two times per week to help him sleep. \nAccording to his medical records form this hospital, combining alcohol with several of \nthe prescription drugs he was taking is a misuse of those prescription drugs. This \ninpatient treatment lasted for about a week. During this treatment, a certified psychiatric \nnurse practitioner diagnosed him with an unspecified schizophrenic spectrum and other \npsychotic disorder, and an unspecified stimulant use disorder (moderate). (Items 2, 3, 5, \n7, 8) \nIn January 2020, Applicant reported that he voluntarily checked himself in to \nanother inpatient hospital because he was again suffering from psychosis. There is no \nevidence in the record as to how long this second inpatient hospitalization lasted, the \nspecific treatment he received, or whether he was diagnosed with a mental health \ndisorder. (Items 2, 3, 7) \nApplicant was evaluated at the DOD\u2019s request by a licensed psychiatrist, and the \nreport of the evaluation was issued on March 8, 2022. After meeting with him virtually, \nreviewing the results of an online psychological inventory, and reviewing Items 3, 5, 6, \nand 8, the DOD\u2019s licensed psychiatrist found his condition to be \u201csuspicious for \nschizophrenia,\u201d but diagnosed him with an unspecified psychotic disorder and \npolysubstance abuse of alcohol and prescription medication. She opined that his \nconditions are likely to impair his reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness, and \nthat his prognosis was guarded. Her prognosis was partly based upon the premise that \nhe was not receiving psychiatric treatment, but he had made an appointment to start \ndoing so. According to a letter from his treatment provider dated October 20, 2022, he \nreceived psychiatric treatment from a licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner since \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 28, 2022, and he remained stable on his current medication and treatment \nregimen. This licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner diagnosed him with schizophrenia \nand attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has made poor decisions and has shown poor \njudgment when he is suffering from psychosis. For example, in March 2020, when he \nwas suffering from psychosis, he drove while he was intoxicated. He claimed that he \nwould not have driven while intoxicated if he had not been suffering from psychosis. He \nalso claimed that he has only abused his prescription medications and alcohol when he \nwas in a period of psychosis and claimed that he would not have abused those \nsubstances otherwise. (Items 2-8) \nApplicant claimed that he is feeling better mentally. He claimed that his treatment \nwith a licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner has helped, and that he plans to continue \nthat treatment, including following her advice regarding prescription medication. He \nclaimed he has had no episodes of psychosis after his January 2020 inpatient \nhospitalization. He claimed that he has learned better coping mechanisms. At the time \nof his meeting with the DOD psychiatrist, he had recently moved in with his father and \nlived closer to his siblings and one of his good friends. He noted that he has sought \ninpatient treatment whenever he has a period of psychosis. He did not indicate whether \nhe still suffers from audio or visual hallucinations or paranoia. He has not received \nsubstance abuse counseling other than detoxification. The DOD licensed psychiatrist \nopined that he should be receiving treatment for substance abuse. She also noted that \nhe had a lower-than-average motivation for treatment level compared to others with \nmental health issues and that he sees little need for changes in his behavior. She \nopined that these qualities are poor prognostic indicators. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8) \nIn February 2008, Applicant drove while intoxicated. He was stopped by police \nand arrested for aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was \nconvicted of this crime. He spent four days in jail and had to pay fines. (Items 2-4, 7) \nIn March 2020, Applicant was consuming alcohol while in a state of psychosis. \nHis dog got out of his house and went missing. Applicant drove his car while intoxicated \nto attempt to find his dog. While he was driving while intoxicated, he struck a power line \npole with his vehicle. Police arrested him and charged him with extreme DUI (.15 per \ncent blood alcohol content (BAC) or higher). He spent the night in jail. In July 2021, he \npleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. The court suspended his driver\u2019s \nlicense for 90 days and ordered him to pay about $1,300 in fines. The court also \nordered him to undergo an online drug and alcohol screening. As of his June 2020 \nsecurity interview, he had not taken this online screening and has not provided any \nevidence that he has since completed it. (Items 2-4, 6-8) \nApplicant provided inconsistent information about his alcohol consumption. \nDuring his 2019 inpatient hospitalization, Applicant reported his aforementioned \nconsumption of a pint of liquor one to two times per week. During his June 2020 security \ninterview, he told the investigator that he drinks four beers about four to five hours \nbefore he takes his prescription medications.

In his response to the SOR, he claimed that he \nnow rarely drinks alcohol and only has a couple of drinks when he does. He provided no \nevidence that he is permitted to consume alcohol while on his current prescription \nmedication regimen. (Items 2, 5, 7, 8) \nBeginning in about June 2013, for a little over two years, Applicant misused his \nemployer-issued company credit card by using it to pay about $86,000 for personal \nexpenses. In April 2016, his employer fired him for this credit card misuse. He claimed \nthat he thought there was an unwritten rule that he could use the company credit card \nfor personal expenses if he timely paid off his balance. However, he did not timely pay \noff the balance. He claimed that he has since satisfied the account after paying about \n$20,000 on it over two years. He provided no documentary evidence of this resolution. \nHe claimed that he now understands this misuse was wrong and he has not misused a \ncompany credit card since 2015. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires 1) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition; and 2) that the condition may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQualified \nmental \nhealth \nprofessionals \nhave \ndiagnosed \nApplicant \nwith \nschizophrenia and an unspecified psychotic disorder. These mental health conditions \ncause Applicant to have periods of psychosis where he shows poor judgment, stability, \nand reliability. For example, he misuses prescription medications, binge drinks alcohol, \nand drives while under the influence of alcohol during his periods of psychosis. He also \nhas trouble remembering his actions after the period of psychosis has ended. The DOD \nlicensed psychiatrist found that his unspecified psychotic disorder may impair his \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. He has twice undergone voluntary \ninpatient hospitalizations for his mental health issues. The above listed disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant has suffered from psychosis, including audio-visual hallucinations since \nabout 2010. As his symptoms lasted for at least 10 years, and he had another inpatient \nhospitalization after his first, I cannot find that his conditions are readily controllable with \ntreatment. Moreover, none of the qualified mental health professionals have opined that \nhis conditions are controllable with treatment. His mental health professional merely \nstated that he was stable at the time of her letter. While I commend him for seeking \ntreatment for his mental health conditions, I also cannot find that the six months of \nmental-health treatment he received as of October 2022 constitutes ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with his treatment plan. AG \u00b6 29(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) does not apply because there is insufficient evidence to show that his \nconditions are controllable with treatment, and he has not received a favorable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprognosis. At best, the evidence shows that he is stable on his current treatment \nregimen. \nThere is no evidence that a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government has opined that Applicant\u2019s \nprevious condition is under control or in remission. There is evidence from a licensed \npsychiatric nurse practitioner, but not one employed by or acceptable to the \nGovernment, that his conditions are under control. Also, there is no evidence that he \nhas a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation. AG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s psychiatric conditions are \ntemporary, and the situation has been resolved. Instead, at best, there is evidence that \nhe has stabilized. AG \u00b6 29(d) does not apply. \nWhile there is evidence that Applicant\u2019s conditions have stabilized, I cannot find \nthat there is no indication of a current problem. Applicant\u2019s mental health conditions \nremain, and he has suffered from bouts of psychosis after treatment in the past. The \nlack of evidence that his conditions are treatable also detracts from a finding that there \nis no indication of a current problem. AG \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. \nI commend Applicant for seeking help with his mental health issues. However, \nnone of the Guideline I mitigating conditions are fully applicable. He has not mitigated \nthose security concerns. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder. \nFor years, Applicant misused prescription medications by overusing them and \nusing them in combination with alcohol. The DOD licensed psychiatrist diagnosed him \nwith polysubstance abuse of prescription drugs. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nWhile it has been about four years since Applicant last misused his prescription \ndrugs, he did so for several years, so his misuse was not infrequent. There is evidence \nthat his mental health conditions are stable, however, there is no evidence that they are \nresolved. As he last misused prescription drugs to help him cope with his still present \nmental health conditions, I cannot find that his misuse happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has acknowledged his prescription drug misuse, and he has undergone \nmental health treatment that has since seen his mental health conditions stabilize. \nHowever, he has not undergone substance abuse treatment. By moving to a more \nstable environment with his father, he has changed the environment where he misused \nthe prescription drugs. He did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse. AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant abused his prescription medication during a prolonged period of mental \nillness. He was legally prescribed the drugs he misused. The record contains consistent \nevidence that he has stopped abusing prescription drugs. AG \u00b6 26(c) applies. \nWhile one of the mitigating conditions is fully applicable and another is partially \napplicable, the applicability of one or more mitigating conditions does not establish \noverall mitigation. Instead, because all doubts must be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity, and because of the questions I have about the potential recurrence of \nprescription drug misuse, I cannot find that the Guideline H security concerns are \nmitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant drove while under the influence of alcohol. On two occasions, he was \narrested while doing so. At one point in time, he was consuming excessive amounts of \nalcohol to help him sleep. This consumption caused him to have impaired judgment as \nevidenced by his March 2020 DUI. He was diagnosed with polysubstance abuse of \nalcohol and prescription medicine but has not received treatment for it. All the above \ndisqualifying conditions are established. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a \ntreatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nWhile it has been about four years since Applicant has had an alcohol-related \nlegal incident, his varying and inconsistent accounts of his alcohol consumption cause \nme to question that his problems with alcohol are unlikely to recur. His failure to seek \nsubstance abuse treatment bolsters my concerns. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant acknowledged that he has a problem with alcohol. He claimed that he \nhas been able to drink less alcohol. However, as his reports of his alcohol consumption \nare inconsistent and varied, he has not provided sufficient evidence of a clear and \nestablished level of alcohol consumption in accordance with a treatment plan. AG \u00b6 \n23(b) does not apply. \nApplicant is not participating in an alcohol-related treatment program, and he has \nnot completed one. AG \u00b6 23(c) and AG \u00b6 23(d) do not apply. None of the Guideline G \nmitigating conditions apply and the alcohol consumption security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant\u2019s Guideline H and G conduct that the Government cross-alleged under \nGuideline E are explicitly covered under those guidelines and are sufficient for an \nadverse finding under those guidelines. AG \u00b6 16(c) and AG \u00b6 16(d) are not established \nwith respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.b, and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to those \nallegations. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated misuse of his employer\u2019s credit card for personal expenses \nover several years involves questionable judgment, dishonesty, and unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. This conduct makes Guideline E applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating condition potentially applies in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nIt has been about eight years since Applicant last misused his employer\u2019s credit \ncard. He claimed that he now understands that he cannot use an employer\u2019s credit card \nto pay for personal expenses and he will not do it again. I find that so much time has \npassed since he engaged in this behavior that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The Guideline E security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines I, H, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered his \nmilitary service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the psychological conditions, drug involvement and substance misuse, and \nalcohol consumption security concerns. He mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n   FOR APPLICANT \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree, and is currently working towards his Masters degree. He holds the \nposition of Mechanical Engineer. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in March 2019. He is applying \nfor a security clearance for the first time. \nAs part of the application process, he \ncompleted the security clearance application (SF-86) dated December 13, 2021. In the \napplication, he admitted illegal drug use. \nApplicant has used marijuana from about 2013 to at least January 2022, with \nvarying frequency. He began smoking marijuana during his first year of college. (Tr. p. \n23.) During this period, he struggled in school, and was depressed. He continued \nsmoking marijuana, mainly in social settings with friends. He testified that he usually \nsmokes marijuana once every two or three months. (Tr. p. 24.) He stated that he used \nit less than 20 times a year or less than 100 times in the last seven years. (Government \nExhibit 1.) He testified that he believed that it was legal to use. He usually obtained it \nfor use from his friends. On one occasion, in 2017/2018, he purchased marijuana at a \ndispensary in a state where he believed it to be legal under state law.  (Tr. p. 26.) \nAfter being hired by his current employer in March 2019, Applicant continued to \nuse marijuana. He states that he is not aware of his company\u2019s drug policy. (Tr. p. 28.) \nNone of his supervisors or management is aware of his illegal drug use. (Tr. p. 28.) \nWhen he was hired, he was advised to read the Employee Handbook, but he did not \ntake the time to do so. He also received regular annual briefings about company \npolicies and procedures. He is not subject to random urinalysis. In January 2022, he \nstopped using marijuana when he learned that federal law prohibits the use of \nmarijuana. \nApplicant explained that he last used marijuana in January 2022, after \ncompleting his security clearance application. He was celebrating his Birthday, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceived marijuana as a Birthday gift from a friend.

In response to interrogatories he completed as part of his security \nclearance background investigation, Applicant initially stated that he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana even after being issued a security clearance. (Government \nExhibit 2.) He explained that he held this belief because of his stubbornness and \nunwillingness to take full responsibility for the current role he is in. \nApplicant shared that he has been seeing a therapist to help him take \nresponsibility for his actions.  Applicant\u2019s father is battling dementia and Applicant has\nrecently been required to help the family by taking his sister to school and other things.  \nApplicant was not happy about having to take on these additional responsibilities.  His \ntherapist is helping him gain a better understanding of how to be responsible.  (Tr. pp. \n30-34.)  \n \nHe is also learning how to believe in himself more, take responsibility for his \nactions and to fully engross himself in any role where he is needed. Applicant states \nthat he is now a role model at work, where he is mentoring the new hires and providing \nguidance to them on the programs and practices used at work. He wants to continue in \nthis role and to one day become a program/project manager in the defense industry \nwhere a security clearance is required. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant submitted copies of his employer\u2019s drug policy and code of conduct. \nThey indicate strict compliance with a substance free workplace. (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibits A and B.)   \nApplicant\u2019s mid-year assessment and year-end assessment are favorable. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits C.) \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s therapist shows that he has been receiving rehabilitative \ncounseling and mentorship skills since October 2021. He is making progress toward \nbuilding his confidence, consistency, and emotional intelligence while exploring past \nmistakes and drug use. He is showing commitment to redemption and rehabilitation. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant has deliberately used \nmarijuana for the past ten years, from 2013 to at least January 2022. He was hired by a \ndefense contractor in March 2019, he applied for a security clearance in December \n2021, and during this period he continued to use marijuana. In April 2022, he stated \nthat he intended to continue to use marijuana after being granted a security clearance. \nHis mindset at this time demonstrates immaturity and poor judgment. In May 2022, in \nhis answer to the SOR, he stated that he intends to stop using marijuana altogether in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \norder to achieve his career goals. However, at the hearing, in October 2022, he stated \nthat he plans to continue to associate with his friends with whom he used marijuana. \n(Tr. p. 37.) His judgment remains questionable. Even if Applicant has abstained from \nthe use of marijuana since January 2022, his extended history of illegal drug use is \ncriminal behavior and demonstrates poor judgment and unreliability. Marijuana is illegal \nunder Federal law, and is clearly prohibited by the DoD under any circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s actions are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant is a 27-year-old man. He has \nnot demonstrated the level of maturity needed in order to access classified information. \nApplicant should know the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand should know that marijuana use is against Federal law and not tolerated. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant is not an individual in whom the Government can be confident \nto know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even \nwhen no one is looking. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a \nsecurity clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a., and 1.b.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 21, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled on March 22, 2023. After \nreviewing the transcript and evidence, I proposed to the parties that this case was \nappropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Applicant did not object. \nDepartment Counsel had 10 days to consider the matter and provided written notice \nthat Department Counsel did not object. \nThis case centers on Applicant\u2019s past use of narcotics with varying frequency, \nfrom approximately 2008 to 2016. The narcotics he used were primarily opiates and \nopioids. He was first introduced to Percocet following knee surgery to repair a torn \nmeniscus and was prescribed opioids following four surgeries to repair intestine \ndamage due to Crohn\u2019s disease. Applicant was continuously enrolled in drug treatment \nprograms from July 2016 to December 2022. He successfully completed treatment in \nDecember 2022, was given a favorable prognosis, and was released. Applicant does \nnot associate with anyone who uses drugs, has an excellent employment record, and \nenjoys strong family support. \nTo demonstrate his commitment to maintaining sobriety, Applicant has taken \nsteps outside of his family support to include joining virtual teleconference Narcotics \nAnonymous meetings and consults with his primary care physician and clinical behavior \nhealth specialists. He participates in one-on-one sessions with a therapist as well as \ngroup sessions within a local university health care system that specializes in opioid \naddiction. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that Department Counsel \npresented sufficient evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR under Guideline \nH. I also conclude that Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts admitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel. In particular, \nI conclude that the security concerns are resolved under the following mitigating \nconditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1)(2)(3), 26(c), and 26(d). \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement and substance misuse \nproblems do not create doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-\nperson concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion \nto show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since 1999. He has an associate\u2019s degree earned in 1996 and \nadditional education and certifications. He married in 2001 and divorced in 2011. He \nhas no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 12-13, 22; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of tax issues. He did not file his federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2010 through 2016, 2018, and 2019 when they were due.1 He \nfiled his returns for tax year 2017 on time, but the IRS thought that there could have \nbeen identity theft. This was likely because Applicant legally changed his name in 2015. \nHe accepted responsibility for his tax failures, which he attributed to poor organizational \nskills, mild depression, and procrastination. He described a bad period of his life in \nwhich he went through a divorce, he was balancing work, and he was taking care of his \naging parents. He asserted that he never intended to shirk his responsibility to pay his \ntaxes. (Tr. at 14-15, 20-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE G, H) \nApplicant reported his failure to file his federal and state tax returns from 2014 to \n2016, 2018, and 2019 on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that \nhe submitted in October 2020. He gave \u201cprocrastination\u201d as the reason, and he wrote \nthat they were \u201c[c]urrently being resolved.\u201d (GE 1) \nApplicant retained a tax professional in 2020. His federal and state tax returns for \n2010 through 2016 and 2018 through 2020 were filed in May 2021. He estimated that, \nwith penalties and interest, he paid about $10,000 in taxes for the tax years 2010 \nthrough 2013. His federal tax liability for 2014 was originally $12,713. He had $8,907 \nwithheld from his pay, leaving about $3,806 owed if he filed his return and paid his taxes \non time. With penalties and interest, the balance grew to $7,294, which he paid in \nOctober 2022. (Tr. at 16-19, 22-23, 28-30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE E, \nH) \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax liability for 2015 was originally $12,363. He had $11,747 \nwithheld from his pay, leaving about $616 owed if he filed his return and paid his taxes \non time. With penalties and interest, the balance grew to $1,228, which he paid in \nOctober 2022. (AE H) \nApplicant would have been due a federal refund of $2,101 for tax year 2016 if his \ntax return had been filed within three years of the due date. He received refunds from \nthe IRS of $1,289 for tax year 2018; $851 for tax year 2019; and $1,434 for tax year \n2020. He filed his returns for 2021 on time. He owed the IRS $805 for tax year 2021, \nwhich he paid on time with his return. He does not owe the IRS or his state any taxes. \n(Tr. at 19; AE F, H) \n1 The SOR did not allege any tax issues before tax year 2014.

He stated that he will continue to file his tax \nreturns and pay his taxes on time. He requested a conditional clearance with \nacknowledgment that failure to file his tax returns and pay his taxes on time could result \nin the loss of his security clearance. (Tr. at 16-19, 27; AE A, D) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his work ethic, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, expertise, professionalism, and willingness and ability to \nprotect classified information. (AE B, C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2014 through 2016, 2018, and 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns when they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. Applicant filed his \n2017 federal and state income tax returns on time. AG \u00b6 19(f) is not applicable to tax \nyear 2017. The language in the allegations referring to tax year 2017 is concluded for \nApplicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax failure, which he attributed to poor \norganizational skills, mild depression, and procrastination. He described a bad period of \nhis life in which he went through a divorce, he was balancing work, and he was taking \ncare of his aging parents. All of the old returns were filed in May 2021 and all of his \npast-due taxes were paid in October 2022. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the filed income \ntax returns, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed. \nApplicant asserted that he never intended to shirk his responsibility to pay his \ntaxes. Whether he intended to or not, that is what he did. He owed about $10,000 for \ntax years 2010 through 2013; $7,294 for 2014; and $1,228 for 2015. He did not finish \npaying those taxes until October 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns on time continues \nto raise doubts about his judgment, reliability and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns is insufficient to overcome the \nyears of Applicant shirking his responsibility to this country to file his tax returns and pay \nhis taxes. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.2 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for tax \nyear 2017, which is found for \nApplicant) \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n2 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded a \nconditional clearance in this case is not warranted.  \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 30 years old, and is not married. He is employed by a defense contractor as a helpdesk supervisor. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant has eleven delinquent debts consisting of nine Federal student loans, one medical debt, and a consumer debt, which were placed for collection totaling approximately $40,584. Credit reports of the Applicant dated August 12, 2021; and April 19, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 7 and 8.) The SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose this financial indebtedness on his security clearance application dated July 27, 2021. (Government Exhibit 4.) Applicant admits allegations 1.a. through 1.k. regarding his financial indebtedness, and he denies allegation 2.a. concerning falsification. Applicant began working for his current employer in August 2018. The following delinquent debts are of security concern: During his interview with a Federal investigator on September 13, 2012, Applicant was confronted with all of the debts alleged in the SOR.

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has eleven delinquent debts consisting of nine \nFederal student loans, one medical debt, and a consumer debt, which were placed for \ncollection totaling approximately $40,584. Credit reports of the Applicant dated August \n12, 2021; and April 19, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 7 and \n8.) The SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose this financial \nindebtedness on his security clearance application dated July 27, 2021. (Government \nExhibit 4.) \nApplicant admits allegations 1.a. through 1.k. regarding his financial \nindebtedness, and he denies allegation 2.a. concerning falsification. Applicant began \nworking for his current employer in August 2018. \nThe following delinquent debts are of security concern: \nDuring his interview with a Federal investigator on September 13, 2012, \nApplicant was confronted with all of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Government Exhibit \n5.) His credit reports show nine delinquent debts owed to the Government for student \nloan accounts that were placed for collection in the approximate amounts of $4,793; \n$6,394; $3,526; $3,362; $2,527; $6,521; $3,170; $5166; and $4,188 totaling about \n$39,647. (See Allegations 1.a., through 1.i of the SOR.) Applicant acknowledged that \nthe accounts were open for his college tuition. He stated that he believed that the \naccounts were opened in his mother\u2019s name. He stated that he did not know that they \nremained owing until it was brought to his attention during the security clearance \nprocess. He further stated that he is actively in the process of resolving these issues. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant submitted no documentation to demonstrate that he \nhas done anything to resolve these debts. The debts remain owing. \n1.j. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection \nin the approximate amount of $912.

Applicant seems to believe that the \nrental company is responsible for the debt. Applicant provided no documentation to \ndemonstrate that the rental company is liable for the debt, or that he has resolved the \ndebt. The debt remains owing. \nA delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $25. Applicant stated that he was not aware of \nthe debt, but that he is in the process of resolving it. The debt remains owing. \nEven if Applicant only learned about his delinquent debts during his September \n2021 interview with the Federal investigator, he has done nothing since then to resolve \nhis debts. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (e-QIP) dated July 27, \n2021. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \nIn response to Section 26, Financial Record, \nDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts: The question asked, \u201cOther than previously \nlisted, have any of the following happened? In the past seven years have you had bills \nor debts turned over to a collection agency?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d and failed to \nlist that he had been delinquent on debts in the past seven years, as noted in Paragraph \n1, Guideline F above. \nApplicant denied that he deliberately lied on his security clearance application \nabout his delinquent debts. \nHe contends that without his knowledge his parents \nopened his student loan accounts to pay for his college tuition. He claims that he had \nno information about the accounts and assumed that his parents had paid them off. His \nexplanation is not reasonable. Applicant knew that the student loans were opened for \nhis college tuition. He knew or should have known that regardless of who promised to \npay his student loans, he would be the one legally responsible to pay them back. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) To assume that his parents opened the accounts using his \nsocial security number and without his consent or awareness is preposterous. Their \nconduct would be criminal. In this case, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his \nfinancial indebtedness on his security clearance application. This shows poor judgment \nand unreliability. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor, dishonesty and unworthiness finds him \nineligible for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not paid. There is \ninsufficient information in the record to conclude whether he is financially stable, or if he \ncan afford his lifestyle, or if he has the financial resources available to handle his \nfinancial obligations. There is no evidence in the record to show that any regular \nmonthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe record is void of mitigation.  Applicant remains delinquently indebted and \npresented no evidence to show that he has made any effort to resolve his debts.  There \nis no evidence in the record to show that circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control \ncontributed to his financial difficulties.  What is known is that Applicant has been \ngainfully employed since 2018, and yet remains excessively indebted.  None of the \nmitigating conditions apply.  This guideline is found against the Applicant.   \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant contends that he knew nothing about his student loan debts until the \nsecurity clearance investigation. This argument holds no merit. He knew or should \nhave known that student loans opened so that he could pay his college tuition must be \npaid back. If he did not pay them back and if he did not check to see if his mother paid \nthem back, he has not demonstrated responsibility. Applicant should have addressed \nhis student loans and knew or should have known that they were delinquent. Applicant \ndeliberately concealed his financial delinquencies from the government on his security \nclearance application. There is no excuse for this dishonesty. Deliberately concealing \nmaterial information from the Government on a security clearance application raises \nserious questions about one\u2019s credibility and trustworthiness. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to respond to \nthe FORM, and submitted nothing in mitigation. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.k. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 62 years-old. He has worked as an administrative technician for a defense contractor since December 2012. He has held a security clearance since November 2012. He earned his associates degree in 2012 and is currently attending an online seminary college. He is able to attend cost free because he is a church member. Applicant has been married for 38 years. He has three adult children. One of his children is currently living at home. Applicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts total over $378,000. The debts are established by his SCA, two credit reports, and his ESI. (Items 3-4 and 6-7.) The specific debts in the SOR are as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b: past-due accounts charged-off for $26,667 and $20,157 respectively. FORM Item 4 shows the status of the debts as closed and a last activity date of May 2019 and a last activity date of November 2016. (Item 4 at 2 and 3.) The accounts remain delinquent because Applicant states he challenged some aspects of the debts in his state\u2019s judicial system, up to his state\u2019s court of appeals. The decision did not go in his favor and he is waiting the final disposition instructions from the Court. (Answer at 3.) 2 SOR \u00b6 1.c: past-due account charged-off for $2,477. FORM Item 4 show",

The case was assigned \nto me on January 12, 2023. \nEvidentiary Issue \nFORM Item 7 is a summary of an enhanced subject interview (ESI) conducted on \nDecember 15, 2021 and January 18, 2022. The ESI summary was not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant the ESI was \nbeing provided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as part of the record \nevidence in this case, and he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of the ESI; make \nany corrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear \nand accurate; object on the ground that the report is unauthenticated. I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objections to the ESI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. \n\u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to \ntake timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 12010810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nThe SOR and the answer (FORM Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. \nFORM Items 3 through 7 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h. His admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years-old. He has worked as an administrative technician for a \ndefense contractor since December 2012. He has held a security clearance since \nNovember 2012. He earned his associates degree in 2012 and is currently attending an \nonline seminary college. He is able to attend cost free because he is a church member. \nApplicant has been married for 38 years. He has three adult children. One of his \nchildren is currently living at home. \nApplicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts total over $378,000. The debts are established \nby his SCA, two credit reports, and his ESI. (Items 3-4 and 6-7.) The specific debts in the \nSOR are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b: past-due accounts charged-off for $26,667 and $20,157 \nrespectively. FORM Item 4 shows the status of the debts as closed and a last activity date \nof May 2019 and a last activity date of November 2016. (Item 4 at 2 and 3.) The accounts \nremain delinquent because Applicant states he challenged some aspects of the debts in \nhis state\u2019s judicial system, up to his state\u2019s court of appeals. The decision did not go in \nhis favor and he is waiting the final disposition instructions from the Court.

(Answer at 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: past-due account charged-off for $1,210. FORM Item 4 shows the \nstatus of the debt as closed and a last activity date of November 2021.

(Answer at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: past-due utility account referred for collection for $134. FORM Item 4 \nshows a last activity date of November 2021. (Item 4 at 4.)

(Answer at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: past-due medical account referred for collection for $80. FORM Item 4 \nshows a last activity date of November 2021. (Item 4 at 5.) Applicant states this debt was \nincurred for services provided to a family member that he believed would be paid under \nhis health insurance policy. (Answer at 4.) He offered a payment summary showing he \nhad paid the debt by credit card in July 2022. (Answer at 8.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: past-due mortgage account for $164,869, with a total loan balance of \n$381,477 that is in foreclosure status. (Item 4 at 6.) Applicant states the mortgage \npayments were consistently made on time until a credit report error. He notes the account \nremains delinquent while the lender is pursuing a foreclosure action to re-claim the \nproperty. (Answer at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: past-due home equity loan for $163,126, with a total balance of \n$289,018. (Item 4 at 6.) This debt was incurred when he took a loan against his primary \nresidence to obtain funds to start his Limited Liability Company (LLC). \nApplicant in his answer explained that in early 2012, he and his brother-in-law \nformed an LLC \u201cto acquire real estate for the purpose of investment (buy houses cheap, \nmake some needed repairs, then re-sell for a profit).\u201d The LLC was a single member LLC, \nand he was the sole member. His brother-in-law lacked the financial resources and credit \nhistory to be a formal partner. However, his brother-in-law was experienced in buying and \nselling real estate, so he handled finding properties and securing financing for the LLC. \nApplicant handled repair work and hiring contractors. However, when Applicant began his \ncareer with his sponsor in December 2012, he found he had significantly less time to \nspend on the LLC to expedite repair work and oversee transactions. \nApplicant states in 2014 an erroneous action on the part of a lender resulted in the \nLLC being unable to secure financing to buy properties and make necessary repairs to \nattract home buyers. This error and the ramifications of it resulted in the LLC being \ndissolved in 2017.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThis case involves an Applicant\u2019s inability to pay debts, arising from a series of\ninvestment decisions. His admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability\nto satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b619 (b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b619 (e)\n(\u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of \nlate payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators.\u201d) \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. The erroneous action by the lender, cited by \nApplicant, may have resulted in the LLC being unable to secure financing to continue the \nbusiness. The circumstances he claims triggered the largest debts are unlikely to recur, \nbut they are recent, numerous and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant cites being unable to devote time to \nhis business after taking his job with his sponsor. However, he does not support his claim \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve his business obligations. \nHe has not shown the basis for the legal proceedings concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nHe admitted he had not resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e and these debts were due to oversights \non his part. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant provided evidence to support his \nassertion he paid his medical debt, SOR \u00b6 1.f. The delinquent medical debt was resolved \nprior to completing his SCA. He presented no documentary evidence of negotiations or \noffers of settlement concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b or the other alleged debts. While his \nAnswer provides some evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve the debts, he has not \nshown that he is pursuing a course of action that has a reasonable chance of success. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established for the delinquent mortgages and lines \nof credit or the delinquent accounts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. This mitigating condition is not established because \nApplicant has not provided documentary evidence to support his claim he disputed any \nof the debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n          \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:     \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n     Subparagraph 1.f: \n     Subparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since July 2022. In September 2022, she was removed from her position because her interim clearance was suspended pending her security clearance adjudication. The company has saved a position for her if she receives her security clearance. She served on active duty in the United States Navy from 2011 to 2015, separating with an honorable discharge at the rank of Petty Officer Second Class. She deployed overseas on two occasions. She has some college credits. She is married, but separated from her spouse in 2017. She has no children. (Tr. at 16, 23-24, 43-45, 85; GE 1, 2; AE I) Guideline F, Financial Considerations On May 10, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nBetween July 2016 to February 2021, Applicant was fired from five jobs. She left \nanother job without providing notice and without paying back a $500 relocation bonus to \nher employer. Her employment history raises concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c) about her \njudgment, trustworthiness and reliability which raises issues about whether she will \nproperly safeguard classified information. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nInitially, Applicant was young and just starting out in the civilian employment \nworld. While concerning, her employment history is understandable. Overtime, \nApplicant has since matured and her current employer speaks highly of her. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c \nand 17 (d) apply She mitigated the concerns raised under the Personal Conduct \nConcern. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile Applicant intends to pay her debts, a lot of the alleged delinquent debts \nremain unresolved. After the hearing, Applicant entered into repayment plans for three \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.t). With regards to these debts, she has not developed a \nsignificant track record of regular timely payments to indicate she is likely to resolve \nthem. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nadversely affected her financial situation. After separating from active duty, she \nexperienced several periods of unemployment. She also had several health issues. This \nmitigating condition is given less weight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsibly under the circumstances. While Applicant struggled financially after \nseparating from active duty in 2015, it has been eight years. By now, she should have \ndeveloped a plan to manage her finances, yet, she continues to have financial issues. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) partially apply in that Applicant testified that she was \nseeking the assistance of a financial counselor. She likely resolved the medical debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1i \u2013 1.l. She also resolved several accounts not alleged in the SOR. \nBoth mitigating conditions are given less weight because Applicant still has several \nunresolved debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did not provide sufficient \ninformation about the debts she disputed and any evidence of actions she has taken to \ndispute each debt. \nWhile Applicant is taking steps to resolve her financial problems, the evidence is \ninsufficient for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within \na reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. None of the \nmitigating conditions are sufficient to fully mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service in the United States Navy. \nconsidered the favorable recommendations of her co-workers. I considered that she is \nattending college.

At this time, Applicant\u2019s history of financial \nproblems remains a concern. \nI find Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Personal Conduct. \nApplicant did not mitigate the concern raised under Financial Conduct. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance at this time.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h, 1.m-1.aa  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.l \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nAppellant has used marijuana for about 25 years, and purchased it for at lease \n16 years. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. He also expressed an intent to \ncontinue to use marijuana in the future, establishing AG \u00b6 25 (g). \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. Applicant, despite having notice of the Government\u2019s \nconcerns when he executed his e-QIP, still uses a Federally recognized illegal \nsubstance and intends to continue its usage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant intends to continue to \nviolate Federal Law by regularly using marijuana in the future. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is a few hours away from earning his masters. (Tr. \n5-6, 20, 24; GE 1-2)  \n \nApplicant retired from the Army in 2007, at the rank of sergeant major (paygrade \nE-9). During his 21 years of service, he served in overseas locations over nine years. He \nfirst deployed for Desert Storm in 1990-1991. Over the years, he deployed six more times \nto the Southwest Asia region. His last deployment was in 2005. He received numerous \ndecorations for his service as reflected on his discharge certificate (DD-214), including: \nthe Meritorious Service Medal (third device); the Army Commendation Medal (fourth \ndevice); and the Army Achievement Medal (fifth device). (Tr. 19-20, 45; AE A) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a mortgage account that went to foreclosure \nand 10 past due, collection, or charged-off debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k) With the exception of \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h, the debts are established by entries on credit reports from November \n2019, July 2022, and February 2023. I gave no weight to GE 5 because it offered no \nprobative information about Applicant\u2019s alleged specific debts, and it referred to a credit \nreport that was not included in the exhibit. Regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h, the record contains \nno evidence that those specific debts were in a past due, charged off, or collection status. \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he only admitted to having those accounts, not to any \ndelinquencies. I find that the Government failed to establish those debts as delinquent. \n(GE 1-6; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant explained that his financial difficulties started in 2019 when his rental \nproperty became vacant after a long-term tenant left. He was unable to secure another \ntenant and the expenses of maintaining that property, along with his residential property \ncaused increased financial distress. Additionally, he and his current spouse separated for \na time, requiring him to support two separate households. They are back together now. \nDuring this time, he used credit cards to make repairs to the rental property and his \nresidence. He admitted going through a bankruptcy in 1995, where he had approximately \n$74,000 in debts discharged (this was not alleged in the SOR and will not be used by me \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas a basis for disqualification, but I may consider this information as it could relate to his \ncredibility, the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and in assessing the whole-\nperson factors).

His latest credit reports show that he had several large-\nbalance accounts that he is making timely payment on and he has reduced or eliminated \nthe balances on several of these accounts. (Tr. 21-22, 48; AE B) \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$1,344. Applicant admitted this credit-card debt. He thought he used it \nto purchase a television and other consumer goods. There is a discrepancy among the \ncredit reports as to the last activity date. One stated that the last activity was in October \n2019, and two others stated it was September 2017. He testified that he has attempted \nto resolve this account by contacting the creditor, only to find out the account was sold to \nsome other creditor or collection service. He is still attempting to resolve this debt. (Tr. \n26-27; GE 3-4, 6, Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-$146,000 (Mortgage Foreclosure). Applicant admitted this debt as \ndescribed above concerning his rental property. His efforts to address this debt included \ntrying to secure tenants for this rental property, continuing to make the mortgage \npayments for several months while he was able to do so, and attempting to sell the \nproperty. The bank foreclosed before he could sell it. Applicant has never been contacted \nabout a deficiency after the foreclosure. (Tr. 28-29; GE 3-4, 6; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$19,145 (Second Mortgage Foreclosure). Applicant admitted this \ndebt as described above concerning his rental property. His efforts to address this debt \nincluded trying to secure tenants for this rental property, continuing to make the mortgage \npayments for several months while he was able to do so, and attempting to sell the \nproperty. The bank foreclosed before he could sell it.

He is still attempting to resolve this \ndebt and is awaiting a settlement offer from the current debt holder. (Tr. 38; GE 3-4, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k-$738. Applicant explained that this is an education debt for which he \nwas erroneously charged. He initially took a class, but he dropped the class within the \ntimeframe allowed. He was still charged for the class. He has disputed this debt. It no \nlonger appears on his two most recent credit reports. (Tr. 39; GE 4, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income, from all sources, is approximately $13,700, and his \nmonthly expenses are approximately $6,200, leaving a monthly remainder of $7,500 to \naddress his remaining debts. He testified that he put his life in harm\u2019s way for this country \nnumerous times and that he would never do anything to jeopardize the United States. (Tr. \n56-57; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had delinquent debts that were unpaid or unresolved. Some of the \nalleged debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h, were not established as being delinquent, but for the \nremaining debts the above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.   \nApplicant faced circumstances beyond his control when his tenant vacated his \nrental property and he could no longer afford to pay the mortgage on that property, his \nresidential mortgage, and the separate household for his wife when they temporarily \nseparated in 2019. He acted responsibly by paying the mortgage for several months and \nsought a renter, before he could no longer afford to do so. He also attempted to sell the \nproperty, but the bank foreclosed before a sale could be accomplished. Both the first and \nsecond mortgage accounts on the rental property were resolved by the foreclosure and \nApplicant was never notified of any deficiencies. These difficulties led to him having to \nuse credit cards during that time. While he certainly should have pursued resolving his \ncredit-card debts in a timelier fashion, he was hindered by the subsequent sales of the \naccounts to secondary creditors. He is pursuing resolution of those accounts. His two \nrecent credit reports show his history of paying his debts and paying off or significantly \nreducing numerous large-balance accounts. There are clear indications that his debts are \nbeing resolved and that he is making good-faith efforts to do so. Applicant reasonably \ndisputed an educational debt. All the above mitigating conditions substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his nine years of service in foreign \ncountries, his seven deployments between 1990 and 2005, his decorations, and his \nfinancial difficulties related to his rental property. While Applicant could have been timelier \nin resolving of his debts, he is working toward resolving the unpaid credit cards. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

He earned \nan associate degree in 2001. He has been taking college courses towards earning an \ninformation technology (IT) certification since December 2022. He has worked in \nengineering for a defense contractor, with a security clearance, since March 2016. (Tr. \n10, 16, 21, 35) \nThe SOR alleges two federal student loans owed to the Department of Education \n(\u00b6 1.a, for $18,001 and \u00b6 1.b, for $11,864), totaling $29,865. Applicant admitted both debts \nin his Answer, and they are also established by his March 2022 credit report (GE 2). \nApplicant used these two student loans to finance his associate degree. The \noriginal amount of the loans totaled about $25,000-26,000. The loans were reported in \ncollection status in early 2019. (GE 2; Tr. 23) He did not disclose any delinquent debts on \nhis February 2021 SCA. (GE 1) \nApplicant attributed his delay in repaying the loans to periods of underemployment \nand unemployment in the years after he earned his degree. He was not able to find stable \nemployment until 2010. He worked for a medical company from 2010 to 2014. In 2014, \nhe relocated to his current home state. He worked in the real estate sector from 2014 until \n2016, when he joined the defense industry and secured his current employment. (GE 1; \nTr. 24-27) \nApplicant secured deferments of his loan payments twice. He said he has never \nbeen on a repayment plan for his student loans. He acknowledged that there were several \nyears where he took no action towards his loans. He admitted that he should have taken \ncare of them many years ago and is \u201cembarrassed about it\u201d now. (Tr. 28-29, 37) \nApplicant acknowledged that when he started with his employer in 2016, he was \ncontacted and asked to begin repayments on his student loans.

(Tr. \n39-40) He maintained that he did not have sufficient funds to address his student loans\nuntil he was hired by his current employer. His starting annual salary with his current\nemployer was about $13,000 or 14,000. Since then, his salary has steadily increased,\nand he now earns an annual salary of $63,800. (Tr. 23-27) \n \n \n \nApplicant knew that delinquent debts were an issue for getting a clearance \nbecause of the potential for \u201ccompromise.\u201d His expenses have increased since he \nresumed taking classes in December 2022. He is financing his current courses \u201cout of \npocket\u201d and through a tuition reimbursement employee benefit. He anticipates that he will \npay about $14,000 to $16,000 \u201cout of pocket.\u201d The record did not indicate the amount he \nhas paid to date. (Tr. 29-30, 47-48) \nApplicant has not been contacted by the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) \nabout resuming his student loan payments after the post-COVID-19 forbearance program \nends this fall. (Tr. 29, 37-41) He knows that his past-due student loans are a \u201croadblock\u201d \nto furthering his education, but he has been concerned about beginning a payment plan \nand then falling behind. (Tr. 32-34, 45-47, 49-50) There is no indication in the record that \nhe ever contacted the USDOE to attempt even an income-based repayment plan. \nAt the hearing, Applicant detailed his plan to resolve the student loan debt. He \nintends to pay off his student loans in full by using the equity from his home. A few weeks \nbefore the hearing, he applied to refinance his mortgage. He believes he currently owes \njust under $30,000 in student loans. He plans to take the equity from the mortgage \nrefinancing and make one lump-sum payment to resolve the loan in full. He expects that \nhis monthly mortgage payment will increase from $900 to $1,300, which he said he has \nsufficient savings to address. However, the true impact on his monthly finances is unclear, \nsince it is too soon to tell without more information. (Tr. 29-34, 46-50) \nApplicant does not maintain a written budget, but he is current with all of his bills, \nand is able to detail his monthly expenses. He has no other delinquent debts. He has \nnever had a security violation. He would never do anything to compromise himself \nbecause he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say anything about what I do or how I do it.\u201d He has no past-due \ntaxes or tax returns. (Tr. 35-36, 42-44, 48-52) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided an update regarding his progress in resolving \nhis student loan debt. An August 4, 2023 Department of Education statement reflected \nhis total loan balance of $29,866 ($29,042 in principal and $823 in interest). (AE B) His \nmortgage refinance was conditionally approved at some point after the hearing, but final \nclosing was pending. (AE C) He indicated that he had reduced his 401(k) contributions. \nHe said he has been \u201cscared straight.\u201d (AE A) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline provides several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19. The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant federal student loans became delinquent in about 2019 before they were \nplaced in forbearance during the COVID-19 pandemic. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant incurred federal student loans to finance the associate degree that he \nearned in 2001. He had some employment instability for several years thereafter and \nbegan working for his current employer in 2016 at a low salary. These circumstances \nimpacted his ability and willingness to repay his student loans. He deferred payments \nseveral times but has never been on a repayment plan for his student loans, even one \nbased on his income. He did not initiate efforts to repay his loans until shortly before his \nhearing. His plan to resolve the loans by refinancing his mortgage is not unreasonable. \nHowever, since his loans have been in existence for more than 20 years, his current plan, \neven if put into effect, comes too late to show responsible action. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans remain unresolved and unaddressed. The COVID-19 \nforbearance program does not excuse his earlier years of inaction. ISCR Case No. 20-\n01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021); ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, \n2021). It is not required that Applicant pay all of his student loan debts at once, or in any \nparticular way. What is needed is a reasonable plan, and steps taken towards putting that \nplan into effect, such as with a track record of steady payments towards the debt. \nApplicant has not done this.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to address his \ndelinquent student loans on the eve of his hearing is not enough to show good faith, \nparticularly when balanced against many years of inaction. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial security concerns. This is not to say he cannot apply for \na clearance again in the future when he has a track record of financial responsibility \ntowards his debts. But at this time, he has not met his burden of mitigating the security \nconcern shown by his past-due student loans. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

At the close of the hearing, in response \nto Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument, I queried if there would be an objection to a \nsummary disposition. Department Counsel did not object. On June 16, 2023, I formally \nproposed to the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.

Prior to her emergency surgery she had \nretained a lawyer to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She has paid what she can when \nemployed and established a plan to resolve her financial problems.

I have incorporated his \nadmissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He earned some college credits but not a degree. He \nwas married from 2005 to 2007. He remarried in 2016 and was divorced in 2020. He \nhas two children from his second marriage, ages 11 and 6. He has been employed by \nfederal contractors since approximately 2011 and by his present employer since 2019. \nHe is responsible for providing maintenance on the hardware of both classified and \nunclassified government computers. He stated he does not have access to classified \nsites but is responsible for the cables and fiber optics to them. (Tr. 16-22, 104-108; GE \n1) \nApplicant and his second wife separated sometime around May 2019. He stated \nthat he believed at that time they were still working on saving their marriage. In October \n2019, he learned that she obtained a default judgment for divorce from him. The \njudgment was later vacated, and they proceeded to divorce and were awarded equal \ncustody of the children. After the divorce was final, he learned from one of his children \nthat his ex-wife had been having an affair with his cousin while they were still married. \nApplicant sent her inappropriate text messages. He admitted he lost his temper. Based \non the text messages, his ex-wife sought protection from the court. (Tr. 22-29; GE 2, 3) \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant\u2019s attorney advised him that it would be beneficial if \nhe started an anger management class. When he enrolled, it was recommended that he \nalso take a class on domestic abuse, which included the anger management class. The \nclass lasted 24 weeks. When he went to court, the judge ruled the text messages were \nharassing and threatening, which resulted in an ex parte order of protection issued \nagainst Applicant in July 2020.

He was ordered to continue taking the anger management classes. (Tr.27-38, 84-\n86; AE A; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant testified that he has severe back pain and in 2013, his doctor \nprescribed oxycodone for the pain. He did not feel good on the pain medication. In \n2015, due to his own concern about the addictive nature of the drug, he told his doctor \nhe wanted to pursue different pain management. He was weened off oxycodone. His \ndoctor suggested he use Cannabidiol (CBD). He was told it was natural and not a \nnarcotic. It relieved his pain and allowed him to function normally. Applicant stated he \ncould purchase the CBD legally in his state. He used it as a muscle relaxer for his pain \nand back condition. He believed he could use CBD because it is legal in his state. He \ndid not know of any federal law implications. He purchased and used it regularly from \nMay 2015 to May 2021. (Tr. 39-52, 91-100) \nThe Security Executive Agent for the United States Government provided \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance \naddressed CBD products: \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that \nusing these cannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in \naccordance with SEAD 4. Although the passage of the Agricultural \nImprovement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from the definition of marijuana \nwithin the Controlled Substances Act, products containing greater than a \n0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d \nAccordingly, products labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than \n0.3 percent THC continue to meet the legal definition of marijuana, and \ntherefore remain illegal to use under federal law and policy. Additionally, \nagencies should be aware that the Federal Drug Administration does not \ncertify levels of THC in CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot \nbe guaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD \nproduct under federal law. Studies have shown that some CBD products \nexceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold for hemp, notwithstanding \nadvertising labels (Reference F). Therefore, there is a risk that using these \nproducts may nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in \na positive marijuana test under agency-administered employment or \nrandom drug testing programs. Should an individual test positive, they will \nbe subject to an investigation under specific guidelines established by \ntheir home agency.  \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) \nprovided a warning about CBD products on July 24, 2019: \nStudies have shown that some CBD products\u2019 labeling does not \naccurately reflect their content.

(Tr. 47-48; AE B) \nIn May 2021, Applicant went back to court to have his visitation with his children \nreinstated. The court determined that if both parties wanted to see their children, they \nwere required to take a drug test. Applicant testified that earlier that month, he was \nattending a bachelor party in a state where marijuana is legal. He testified he used \nmarijuana at the party and was aware that although it was legal in the state where he \nwas located, it was illegal under federal law. He held a security clearance at the time. \nHe said it had been a stressful year due to the court proceedings, and he decided \u201cwell \nI\u2019ll just have fun one night.\u201d (Tr. 39, 53-55, 91-92) \nWhile in court, the judge asked Applicant if any drug would be detected during \nthe drug screening. Applicant told the Court about his marijuana use earlier that month \nand that he is prescribed Adderall. The judge told both parties before the drug test that if \nthey did not testify honestly, they would be subject to contempt and a ten-day jail \nsentence. Applicant\u2019s drug screen tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. \nApplicant adamantly denied he knowingly used methamphetamine. He said he had no \nidea how he tested positive for methamphetamine, but he had several theories. He said \nthe judge believed he had lied to him. Applicant concurred that he would have believed \nthe same if he saw a positive drug result. Applicant testified that the judge told him that \nhe needed to go to drug rehabilitation and assess his life, and he told him how to live. \nApplicant acknowledged he had a negative attitude, and he was upset. He told the \njudge \u201cYou need to worry about you. I got me.\u201d Applicant testified that he was held in \ncontempt of court because the judge believed he was dishonest about his drug use after \nhe tested positive for two illegal drugs. He served a 10-day sentence for contempt. (Tr. \n55-63, 86-88; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that part of his visitation order is that if he wanted to see his \nchildren, he had to provide a drug screen. Applicant did not have to do a drug screen if \nhe did not plan to see his children. Applicant provided negative drug screen results \ntaken from hair follicles.

(Tr. 65-75, 88-91; GE 2 page 13) \nApplicant testified that he continued to participate in counseling even after the \n24-week class ended. He said he did not know he had anger issues until he went \nthrough counseling. He still meets with a counselor, and they have lunch together. He \nalso attends classes occasionally. The counselor provided a report that Applicant had \nsuccessfully completed the required session. He made a $2,500 donation to his \ncounselor\u2019s facility. (Tr. 84-86; AE A) \nApplicant testified that he was going through a difficult time in his life when he \nwas dealing with an acrimonious divorce, and he was unable to see his children. He \nattributed his marijuana use to stress in his life. He loves and is devoted to his job. He \nadmitted he made a mistake. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing statement mentioned his family\u2019s \nservice in the military and federal government. He stated he is not a threat or liability. \nHe stated: \u201cI refused to snitch when I tested positive for drugs and was charged with \ncontempt.\u201d He further stated that he does not sell out his friends, family, or country. He \nbelieves he has been an asset to the military community. (Tr. 78; AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s candid testimony about his CBD use. Although he \nknowingly used CBD, he did not believe he was using marijuana. There is no evidence \nhe was using it for anything other than for medicinal purposes. Based on the information \nabout the possibility that CBDs may have levels of THC that are in excess of what is on \ntheir labels, I do not believe he intentionally or knowingly attempted to use THC. There \nis no evidence that the CBDs he used contained THC. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant knowingly and \nintentionally used marijuana in May 2021 based on his admission and a positive drug \ntest. Applicant failed a court-ordered drug screen testing positive for both marijuana and \nmethamphetamine. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s job is classified as a \nsensitive position. There is evidence he held a security clearance when he used \nmarijuana and methamphetamine, but not while he was granted access to classified \ninformation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) apply. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nunder the drug involvement guideline. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant knowingly and intentionally used marijuana because he thought he \nwould have fun. This does not reflect a mature attitude about illegal drug use, especially \nwhen holding a security clearance. He denies he used methamphetamine, but his court-\nordered drug test reflects a positive result. His use of the drugs was while he was \nattempting to gain visitation of his children. I have considered his negative drug tests \nthat are required if he wants to see his children. Although he is remorseful for his \nconduct, I am unable to find that his conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Applicant may be \ncommitted to not using illegal drugs again in the future, but it is too soon to negate his \nknowing and intentional past drug use. Despite some mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b), it is \ninsufficient to mitigate his conduct. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . .

Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was deemed by the Court to have sent harassing and/or threatening \ntext messages to his former spouse, resulting in an ex parte order of protection issued \nagainst him in July 2020. Applicant was held in contempt of court in May 2021 for being \ndishonest to the court and was sentenced to 10 days in jail, which he served. His court \ndocuments reflect that in November 2021 he admitted to being in civil contempt for \nviolating a no contact order. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the above disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation. Mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying security concerns based on \nthe facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant has participated in domestic violence counseling and anger \nmanagement, which are positive steps. However, honesty is a cornerstone of the \nsecurity clearance process. Failing to follow an ex parte order of protection raises \nquestions about his ability and commitment to following rules and regulations. To be \ndishonest and somewhat glib to a judge also raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s respect \nfor the law and authority. There is no doubt Applicant was involved in an acrimonious \ndivorce and custody issues. However, violating a court order and going to jail for \ncontempt were not minor and were not infrequent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) have some \napplication, but they are insufficient to overcome the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance.

The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old woman with two adult children and one teenage child. \nfrom a previous relationship. (Tr. 21; GE 1 at 24-25) 2 She was married from 2016 until her \ndivorce in April 2023. (Tr. 14) She has a high school diploma and she has taken a few \nsemesters of college courses. (GE 2 at 2) Since June 2022, she has been working for a \ndefense contractor as a facility security officer. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She attributes them primarily to low \nwages, lack of money management skills, and difficulty affording to raise children without \nadequate child support. (GE 2 at 3) Her financial problems were later exacerbated by her \ntroubled marriage, as her ex-husband often opened charge accounts in her name without \nher knowledge. Moreover, after their separation, Applicant\u2019s husband failed to abide by the \nseparation agreement to pay some of the bills. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. 15) Applicant\u2019s difficulties \npaying for medical care also strained her finances. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt, as alleged in the SOR, totals approximately $45,000, \nApproximately $26,000 of this debt is composed of medical bills, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m - 1.o, and 1.t through 1.v. (Tr. 46) Applicant incurred \nthese bills before she began working at her current job. At that time, she received Medicaid \nhealth benefits. She was unaware that Medicaid did not cover her bills in their entirety. (GE \n2 at 5; Tr. 35) Some of these medical bills are nearly 25 years old. (Answer at 1) She \nintends to call these treatment providers and apply for a medical debt relief program to help \nher satisfy the debts. (Answer) She has not yet begun paying any of these debts and she \nprovided no evidence that she has applied for a medical debt relief program. \nApproximately $14,500 of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt constitutes federal \ngovernment student loans, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.f,, 1.i and 1.p. \nThey were in COVID-related forbearance through August 2022 . (Tr. 32) Applicant has not \nmade any payments since the forbearance ended. (Tr. 33) She was supposed to pay the \ncreditors $5 per month, the amount she was paying before the pandemic. (Tr. 33) \nApproximately $2,500 of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt constitute private student loan \naccounts, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q. Currently, they are in \nforbearance, and will remain so until October 2023. (AE A) \nThe remaining miscellaneous debts, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.g, 1.k, 1.r, 1.s, \nand 1.w through 1.aa, total approximately $5,100.

(AE B) She satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.y, totaling $1,008, in 2020. \n(AE C) The others remain outstanding. \nIn approximately 2018, Applicant retained a debt resolution company to help her with \nher financial problems. (Tr. 27) She contends that they disputed all of her delinquent debts \non her behalf, and helped her resolve debts that were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 28) She \ndid not provide a copy of any retainer agreement or any evidence of the work they \naccomplished. (Tr. 27-28) \nIn July 2023, Applicant consulted a credit repair company. It is researching her \ncredit, identifying bills, and advising her on which bills that she should dispute. (AE D) \nApplicant earns $72,000 per year. (Tr. 22) She has nominal monthly income and \nlives \u201cpaycheck to paycheck.\u201d (Tr. 25) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) The student loan accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q are back in \nforbearance. Applicant caught up on payments to the creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.r, \nas duplicated in subparagraph 1.z. She satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.y, \nthree years ago in 2020. I resolve these allegations in her favor. As for the remainder, her \nhistory of financial problems, and continuing inability to resolve the majority of her debt \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems originally stemmed from difficulty making ends meet \nas a single mother, and they were exacerbated years later after the man whom she married \nbegan abusing her credit towards the end of their marriage. Conversely, she has not taken \nany appreciable steps to resolve her medical bills, despite the fact that some are more than \n25 years old, and she did not outline a plan for satisfying the federal student loan debts \nnow that they are out of forbearance. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(b) is only \npartially applicable. \nAlthough Applicant worked with a debt resolution company several years ago, she \nprovided no evidence of the work that it accomplished. Although Applicant recently retained \na credit repair agency, she did so more than a year after the issuance of the SOR, and one \nmonth after the hearing. Moreover, she has not provided a plan for paying the delinquent \nstudent loans, nor has she presented evidence that she has applied for assistance to pay \nher medical debts, as she testified that she was going to do. Under these circumstances, I \ncannot conclude that either AG \u00b6 20(c), or AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. In sum, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by reckless or irresponsible \nspending. Instead, they were caused by lack of income needed to make ends meet without \nusing credit cards, and they were exacerbated by a divorce. Nevertheless, Applicant still \nhas the burden of demonstrating steps she has taken to alleviate these problems. Although \nApplicant presented some evidence, it was insufficient to provide a clear picture that she \nhas gotten her troubled finances under control. Under these circumstances, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p \u2013 1.r: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.s \u2013 1.x:: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.y \u2013 1.z: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.aa: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He declined to have the record held open. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received the transcript (Tr.) on July \n17, 2023. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an \ninspector. He has worked for his current employer since 2017. He seeks to reestablish \nhis security clearance. He earned his high school diploma in 2017 and has completed \nsome apprentice courses but has not obtained a degree. He previously held a security \nclearance from December 2017 until it was suspended in September 2021. He is single, \nlives with his partner, and they have three young children. (GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21; Tr. \n17-18.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the three Guideline H allegations. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, that he purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nJanuary 2012 through January 2019. SOR \u00b6 1.b, that he purchased and used marijuana \nas set forth in subparagraph 1.a after being granted access to classified information in \n2018. SOR \u00b6 1.c, that in January 2019 he was arrested and charged with (1) sell, give, or \ndistribute more than one-half ounce, but less than five pounds of marijuana, a felony, and \n(2) carrying concealed weapon. He pled no contest to a reduced drug charge of sell, give, \nor distribute less than one-half ounce (misdemeanor). He was sentenced to 12-months' \nconfinement (11 months suspended), and three-years' probation, which ended in October \n2022.  \nApplicant stated he started to use marijuana when he was 13 and from 2012 to \n2017 he smoked marijuana on a daily basis (Tr. at 18-19.) He stopped smoking marijuana \nfrom March 2017 to about February 2018, which was around the time he was hired by his \nemployer, but he could not recall why he stopped. (Tr. at 20.) In his security clearance \ninterview he told the investigator he stopped to prepare for attending college and \napprentice school where he knew he would be required to pass a drug screening. (GE 3 \nat 6.) After February 2018 he described his usage as \u201cmore of a weekly basis\u2026not every \nday.\u201d (Tr. at 20.) He estimated he would probably purchase about an ounce of marijuana \na week. (Tr. at 20-21.) When he resumed smoking marijuana in February 2018 he held a \nclearance; had been granted to classified information, and he acknowledged in his \ntestimony it was not allowed. (Tr. at 21-22; GE 1 at 27.) He explained his duties generally \nand generally what his security clearance had allowed him access to inspect until it was \nsuspended. (Tr. at 22.) \nIn January 2019, Applicant was pulled over and the officer smelled marijuana in \nthe vehicle. A search of the vehicle found about seven ounces of marijuana in a glass \ncistern, which he purchased for about $1,000. (Tr. at 24, 25-26; GE 5.) He denied any \nintentions to sell the marijuana. (Tr. at 26.) He told the investigator he would purchase \nenough to avoid the long drive. (GE 3 at 5.) The felony charge was reduced to a \nmisdemeanor as part of a plea agreement. He served the unsuspended portion of his \nsentence on weekends, paid a fine, and served probation for three years. (Tr. at 24.) The \ncarrying a concealed weapon charge was dismissed. He claimed that he was legally \ncarrying the weapon. He testified; \u201ctrying to do my due diligence in reading it upon the law \non how to carry my weapon. And, I believe I had it contained legally. It was in a bag that \nwas zipped up that I couldn\u2019t reach in the back of the vehicle.\u201d (Tr. at 27.)

(Tr. at 34.) The weapon was not registered in his name but \nstated it was a gift to him from his brother. (Tr. at 27, 34; GE 3 at 7.) He reported the \nincident to his supervisor and no action was taken by his employer. (GE 3 at 7.) \nApplicant stated he stopped using marijuana after January 2019 because the \narrest was \u201clike a reality check, you know, how fast things can go wrong.\u201d (Tr. at 28.) He \nexplained to the investigator that he has his children to live for now and cannot risk being \nfired because of illegal drugs. He does not want his children around illegal drugs. (GE 3 \nat 7.) He has not attended any substance abuse courses. He no longer associates with \npeople who use marijuana. He has never failed an employer drug test. (Tr. at 29.) There \nare no further terms on his conviction. (Tr. at 39.) He stated in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories he had no intention of further use of marijuana. (GE 3 at 13.) \nApplicant in his Answer denied SOR \u00b6 2.a. Department Counsel queried Applicant \nabout the denial and pointed out this was a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6 1.c. In response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s question, Applicant responded he is not disputing the Guideline J \nallegation. (Tr. at 28.) \nSOR \u00b6  3.a cross-alleges the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, which Applicant denies but \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. The underlying facts were discussed above under \nGuideline H. I applied those facts discussed above to SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nApplicant denies SOR \u00b6 3.b, that he: Falsified material facts on a Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF-86) executed on August 18, 2021, by answering \u201cNo\u201d \nto: \nSection 23-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity Illegal Use of Drugs or \nControlled Substances: In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used \nany drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance \nincludes injecting snorting inhaling, swallowing experimenting with or \notherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance? \nHe testified he believed it was a clerical error and \u201cwhen [he] first lied about \nit in 2017. When [he] went back and when [he] went to refill this out, a lot of things \n[he] didn\u2019t change, and [he] believe[s] this is one of the pages [he] missed, just \nskipped through.\u201d (Answer and Tr. at 30-31.) He believed he was being open and \nhonest in his application when discussing the discrepancy with the security \nclearance investigator. (GE 3 at 6.) \nApplicant denies SOR \u00b6 3.c, that he: Falsified material facts on an SF-86 dated \nAugust 18, 2021, by answering \u201cNo\u201d to: \nSection 22-Police Record Police Record (EVER): \nOther than those \noffenses already listed, have you EVER had the following happen to you? \nHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving firearms or \nexplosives?.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant reported the incident in the drug section of the SF-86.

(Answer and Tr. at 30-31.) He acknowledged the lie in his testimony, \n\u201cWhen I filled out the one in 2017, I did lie knowingly about my marijuana usage. I was \n18, freshly coming out of high school, and really didn\u2019t know what I was getting into when \nI done that one.\u201d (Tr. at 16.) His reason for not revealing his marijuana use at the time; \u201cI \nthought it would affect my employment.\u201d (Tr. at 31.) \nApplicant very credibly described the difference between the man he was in 2019 \nand the man he has become. Four years ago, he would come home, smoke marijuana, \nand go to sleep. He would get off work, smoke and sleep until about 1800, 1900, 2000, \nthen get up and eat, maybe smoke again, and just do nothing, lay around the house all \nday. (Tr. at 38.) He is now a father of three, his oldest child was born in August 2020. He \nnormally works during the week from 0500 to 1300. When he gets home, he takes care \nof the yard and works on his truck because the children are napping until 1600. When \nthey wake up he is with the children making them a snack and taking them to an activity \nlike a jump park, painting, or playing in the sprinkler and after that it would be dinnertime. \nAfter dinner there is some more playtime and then it is time to \u201cchange diapers, [and] get \nready to go to bed.\u201d (Tr. at 38.) Typically, the weekend is spent just trying to keep the \nchildren busy and \u201cnot making a mess inside the house.\u201d (Tr. at 36) He offered as \nexamples attending group children\u2019s readings at a local bookstore or going to the beach. \nHis hobby is working in the driveway on his two vehicles. Aside from a \u201ccold beer on a hot \nday\u201d otherwise he does not drink. (Tr. at 37-38.) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted he used marijuana after being granted access to \nclassified information and purchased marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \napplicable. 25(f) is not applicable. The SOR did not allege use while granted \naccess to classified information, it alleged use \u201cafter being granted access to \nclassified information in or around 2018.\u201d I find SOR 1.b for Applicant as a duplicate \nallegation to SOR 1.a. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant knew throughout the periods of time \nalleged that his use and purchases of marijuana were prohibited under Federal law. He \ncontinued to purchase and use marijuana after applying for a security clearance and after \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing placed on notice that such conduct after being granted access to classified \ninformation was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. In doing so, Applicant not \nonly knowingly violated Federal drug laws but also disregarded security clearance \neligibility standards. This behavior raises substantial questions about Applicant's \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See \nISCR Case No. 20-02974 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). Applicant's statement in the \ninterrogatories of his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future does not mitigate the \nscope of these security concerns. Nor does the passage of a little over a year since he \ncompleted probation eliminate those concerns for an applicant who knowingly violated \nFederal drug laws and continued to use marijuana for at least 12 months after being \ngranted a security clearance. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record, the above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply. While Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline H \nconcerns involving his drug use after being granted access to classified information he \nhas substantially changed his life from when the criminal behavior happened.

He has demonstrated he is successfully rehabilitated and accepts \nresponsibility for his actions. The criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, \nwhile legal there, is illegal in the United States. \nSOR 3.a cross-alleges the conduct set forth in SOR 1.a-1.c, which Applicant \nadmitted and included marijuana use after being granted access to classified information. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable to SOR 3.a. \nSOR 3.b-3.d allege Applicant deliberately failed to disclose certain behavior on his \nSF-86.

AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR 3.d. \nFor SOR 3.b-3.c, Applicant testified he believed SOR 3.b was a clerical error and \nfor SOR 3.c his disclosure in one section covered the issue and that he thought he had \ncovered the concerns. \u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when \nhe executed his Security Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were \nnot binding on the Administrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. \n29, 2006) (citation omitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the \nAppeal Board recognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in \nfalsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) not applicable to SOR 3.c. Applicant thought he had covered the drug \nuse concerns with his disclosure in one section would cover the issue and as a result he \nthought he had covered the concerns. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR 3.b. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a) is established for SOR 3.b. I am satisfied that \nApplicant did not deliberately fail to disclose the information described in SOR 3.b. He \nreported his 2019 arrest for drug misconduct in his 2021 e-QIP and he discussed his drug \nuse with the investigator during his security clearance interview. \nThe mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) is established for SOR 3.d. Applicant candidly \ntestified that his 2017 omission was intentional. Given his age and experience and how \nmuch time has passed, as well as the evidence he has now focused his life on his family \nand work, he has mitigated the security concerns for SOR 3.d. \nApplicant used marijuana after being granted access to classified information, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich had been obtained after intentionally failing to disclose his drug use history. \nPersonal conduct security concerns for SOR 3.a are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H, Guideline J, \nand Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. However, he has mitigated \nGuideline J security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and his admissions establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies to loss of income, expenses due to \nhis son with special needs, injury of his spouse and underemployment. Notwithstanding \nthe events that affected his finances, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. In February 2022, he admitted in an interrogatory \nthat he had not paid or arranged a payment plan with any of his delinquent creditors. At \nthat same time, he submitted a PFS that showed he had just over $1,000 monthly net \nremainder after paying his monthly expenses, which did not include payments to any of \nhis delinquent creditors. His PFS showed that he had not adopted or devised a workable, \nrealistic strategy for addressing his delinquent debts. Applicant stated that it was his \nintention to use funds from his wife\u2019s settlement to pay or settle his delinquent creditors \nin the future. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate the financial concerns in \nthis case. He did not provide any receipts or correspondence from the creditors to validate \nhis claim that he had paid five delinquent accounts. He submitted an April 2022 credit \nreport that showed five of the SOR accounts had dropped off the report. More importantly, \nthere remains 14 outstanding accounts that are largely unaddressed. He submitted an \nundated letter from a credit-repair organization, which acknowledged they had been hired, \nbut there is nothing in the record that shows he successfully disputed, settled, paid, or \ninitiated payments on any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. Overall, I find \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nthat Applicant has not demonstrated that he acted responsibly to address his financial \ndelinquencies. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccess to classified and protected information requires faithful adherence to the \nrules and regulations governing such activity. A person who fails to address concerns, \neven after having been placed on notice that his or her access or security clearance is in \njeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are at stake. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy career in the Marine Corps and his employment with a government contractor \nand the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and \npersuasion. In the event he may wish to alleviate his financial security concerns and revisit \nhis security clearance eligibility in the future, he should consider financial counseling, a \nworkable household budget, and a pattern of attentiveness to his financial obligations. At \nthe present time, Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns \nor establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He attended \ncommunity college for about three months in the fall of 2013. He married in April 2018 \nand has one child, a daughter age four. He purchased a home in November 2019. From \nSeptember 2015 to March 2021, he worked as a support engineer for a large cloud \ncomputing company. Since March 2021. He has been employed as a data center \ntechnician for a defense contractor. He has never held a clearance. (Item 3 and \nResponse.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout November 2010 until at least October 2020; and (2) purchased marijuana with \nvarying frequency from about November 2010 until about October 2020. (Item 1.) \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. (Item 2.) \nIn his July 7, 2021 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant described his \nmarijuana use from November 2010 to October 2020. His use was experimental and to \nbe sociable. He used with a friend, AA, at another friend\u2019s house. The drug was obtained \nby AA. He only bought marijuana once, and that was from AA. AA still used drugs but \nApplicant did not know which drugs or in what amounts. The marijuana made him feel \nrelaxed but had no impact on his personality, judgment, reliability, work, or friends. He \nhad no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. He was not dependent on marijuana. (Item \n4.) \nApplicant described his LSD use from March 2015 to May 2017. He used LSD as \nan experiment after seeing a movie. He used it twice, with his friend, AA, who obtained it. \nIt made him feel anxious and uncomfortable. The use took place once at a hotel room \nand once at a college dorm but had no impact on his personality, judgment, reliability, \nwork, or friends. He has no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. He was not dependent \non LSD. (Item 4.) \nIn his PSI, Applicant described his cocaine use in July 2016. He used it once. He \nused it with a friend, BB, at a bar. BB obtained it. It made him feel hung over but had no \nimpact on his personality, judgment, reliability, work, or friends. He had no intent to use \nillegal drugs in the future. He is not dependent on cocaine. (Item 4.) \nAA is one of Applicant\u2019s friends from high school. They now live in different and \nnot adjacent states. They text and play games \u201cevery once and a while.\u201d He stated: \u201cBut \nwe don\u2019t see each other every other month.

(Item 4.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 24, 2022 response to a DOHA Interrogatory asking the last time \nhe used marijuana, he said: \u201cI genuinely can\u2019t remember the last time I used marijuana \nor a THC product. It\u2019s been about 2 years now. 10/2020 would be a rough guess as to \nthe last time.\u201d (Item 4.) In his Response, he stated that \u201cit\u2019s been almost 3 years since I \nused any THC/Marijuana product.\u201d (Item 4.) In his Response to the FORM, he stated his \nregret for his past use of marijuana and also emphasized that he is now a husband, a \nfather, and the primary provider for his family. \nDiscussion \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline (AG) H, suitability of an applicant may be questioned \nor put into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about \na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, \nand 26 set forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant admitted to purchasing marijuana (once, from AA) and using marijuana \nfrom November 2010 to October 2020. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to an \nSOR require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. \nBd.

In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml. \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nI have also considered the following mitigating conditions under AG H: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2)  changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used: and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all future drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 25(a), Applicant\u2019s marijuana use started in November 2010, which is \nquite long ago. It continued, however until October 2020. So it did recur during that 10-\nyear period and ended quite recently. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug usage is not\nmitigated by AG \u00b6 25(a). \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nThe key under mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(b) is the \u201cpattern of abstinence.\u201d Subparts \n(1) through (3) are simply nonexclusive examples of how such a pattern may be shown. \nIt seems that certain changes in Applicant\u2019s life have operated to disassociate him from \nhis former drug-using friends. In particular, he and AA now live in different, not adjacent, \nstates and see each other only several times a year. Similarly, he is now a homeowner, \nmarried, and the father of a four-year old child. So, the former drug-using environment is \nno more. These are all salutary changes.  \nHere, the \u201cpattern of abstinence\u201d must be weighed against a lengthy period of \nmarijuana use. Applicant began his marijuana use in high school in 2020, not a particularly \nunusual time or place for that to happen. He did, however, continue that recreational use \nuntil about October 2020, by his own estimate. He claimed he is not dependent on \nmarijuana and has no intent to use it in the future. There is nothing in the record that \ncontradicts his representations. But his 10 years of prior marijuana use outweigh his \nrecent few years of abstinence. This is not to minimize his current track record of \nabstinence; it is commendable. If he continues on his present path, he could be a worthy \ncandidate for reapplication. At this point, however, it is not sufficient to mitigate his \nextended history of marijuana use. I must find against him on SOR \u00b6 1. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s one-time use of cocaine and his twice-use of LSD do not \nraise national security concerns. \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through (9) and 2(f)(1) through (6). Accordingly, I conclude that \nApplicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

(AE F-H) The \npertinent facts are summarized in the written requests and fact sheets and will not be \nrepeated verbatim here. Of note is that China is an authoritarian state dominated by the \nChinese Communist Party, with a poor record with respect to human rights. Taiwan is a \ndemocracy. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. \nHowever, the United States does not support Taiwan\u2019s independence from China. \nThe United States faces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese \nintelligence operations. China aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected \ninformation, and Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic \nespionage. Taiwan is also targeted by China. Taiwanese interests have also been \nactive collectors of U.S. economic technologies that have sensitive military applications. \nNumerous cases have arisen involving the illegal export or attempted export of \nsensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of the United States and Taiwan. His in-laws are \ncitizens and residents of Taiwan. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust \nunofficial relationship. However, the United States does not support Taiwan\u2019s \nindependence from China. China aggressively targets U.S. and Taiwanese sensitive \nand protected information. Taiwan has been an active collector of U.S. economic \ntechnologies that have sensitive military applications. Numerous cases have arisen \ninvolving the illegal export or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to \nTaiwan. Applicant\u2019s Taiwanese family members create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion both individually and through his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. He is from a military family, and he served \nhonorably in the U.S. military. His wife came to the United States in 2005; they married \nin 2006; she became a U.S. citizen in 2012; and their three children were born in the \nUnited States. His wife maintains contact with her mother, but her contact with her \nsiblings is much less frequent. Her mother is financially independent. Applicant has very \nlittle contact with any of his in-laws because of the language barrier. He credibly testified \nthat his wife\u2019s family in Taiwan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into \nrevealing classified information. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan are outweighed by his deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the \ninterests of Taiwan. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to $9,000 in auto repairs in 2014 and \nhis failed attempt at flipping houses. Those events were beyond his control, but he also \ntraveled to a foreign country for tourism in 2018 for between 11 and 20 days. \nApplicant is credited with paying $180 and $2,345 to resolve the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The $364 charged-off debt to a credit union (SOR \u00b6 1.k) was \nresolved before July 2019. I accept his testimony that he would have paid the $90 and \n$287 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.j, but the creditors could not locate the debts. \nThose five debts are mitigated. \nThe six remaining debts total about $28,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e-1.i) and are all \nreported on both the November 2019 and April 2022 credit reports. Applicant admitted \nin his SOR response and at the hearing that he owed those debts. Post-hearing, he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nstated, without explanation or documentation, that he only had two debts left to pay off. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to \npresent documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-\n07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 1, 2006)).  \nI infer that Applicant meant that the four debts were no longer on his credit \nreport. The fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any \nmeaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. See, e.g., ADP \nCase No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015) and ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). Additionally, I cannot conclude with any degree of certainty \nthat the debts are not on his credit report, because I only received a partial credit report. \nHe stated that he plans to pay his debts. Intentions to resolve financial problems in the \nfuture are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to eliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He served in the \nArmy National Guard from 1984 until he was honorably discharged in 1999. He married \nin 2001 and has children ages 21, 18, 14, and 11. \nApplicant worked for a federal contractor from April 2004 to December 2014. In \nJanuary 2015, he accepted a transfer due to his employer having funding issues. He took \na significant reduction in pay to maintain employment. His family did not move with him. \nHe held the position until July 2015. From January to 2015 to August 2015, he was \nsupporting two households. He was paying the mortgage on his primary home, the \nmortgage on rental property they owned, and rent where he was living. During this period, \nhis tenants left, and Applicant was no longer receiving rental income. He and his wife \nbegan using credit cards and the balances became unmanageable. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nFrom 2017 to 2019, Applicant began accumulating debt, and in 2018 he began \nmissing payments. In 2019, he was proactive about resolving his debts. He established \npayment plans, a budget, and participated in financial counseling. (Items 7, 8, 9) \nApplicant also attributed his financial problems to the COVID-19 pandemic. He \nwas hospitalized with the virus. His in-laws lived with their family from 2010 until 2022. \nHis father-in-law also contracted the virus and was hospitalized in 2020. He passed away \nin the hospital in 2021. His daughter was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her medical \ntreatment was several hours away. It took numerous medical and hospital visits before \nshe was properly diagnosed in 2020. In addition, his wife was laid off from her job. \nApplicant was also diagnosed with blood cancer upon his return from his military service \nin Iraq. His medical condition is debilitating and impacts his daily life. (Item 3, AE 1, 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent credit card or consumer accounts totaling \napproximately $87,832. It also alleges a foreclosed mortgage on a timeshare with a \nremaining balance of $56,375.

In January 2022, Applicant responded to \ngovernment interrogatories, and he disclosed that that he owed income taxes for tax year \n2018. In his answer to the SOR, he disputed that he owed a tax debt. He provided a copy \nof his 2018 tax transcripts, which shows a zero-balance owed. A refund from tax year \n2018 was applied to a 2017 tax debt, and he received the balance of the refund. He also \nprovided copies of his 2019 and 2020 tax transcripts that shows he owes 15 cents and \n$1.82, respectively. It is noted that according to the transcripts, he failed to timely file his \ntax returns for both years. He filed his 2019 and his 2020 income tax returns in August \n2022, after receiving the SOR. His failure to timely file his income tax returns was not \nalleged in the SOR. (Item 3-Exhibit 12; AE 4) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when applying the mitigating \nconditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nIn July 2019, Applicant enrolled in a debt solution program (GH), which provided \nfinancial counseling and worked with him to establish a budget. He began making \npayments to GH in August 2019. In December 2019, he enrolled in another credit \nassistance program (CAN), which provided him additional financial counseling and \nassistance in paying off his debts.

Applicant completed the terms of the payment agreement in August 2022 and \nresolved the debt. (Item 4-enclosures 8 and 20; AE 9) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($56,375) is alleged as a foreclosure on a timeshare. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant disputed the property was foreclosed. He purchased a \ntimeshare from HIC in 2008 and made payments until sometime in 2018 when his \nfinancial issues became overwhelming. He admits he did not understand the timeshare \nprocess when he purchased it or how his costs continued to increase. There is a process \nwhere a timeshare may be \u201ctraded-in\u201d for another. In 2010, Applicant \u201ctraded in\u201d his \ntimeshare for another and in 2011 he again \u201ctraded-in\u201d the timeshare. He did this again \nin 2015 and 2017. Apparently, the \u201ctrade-in\u201d process is used to leverage use of other HIC \nvacation properties across the country and is also another way to increase owner costs. \nEach time one wants to use a property in another location, they would have to trade in \nthrough the exchange process which increased the costs, which was never mentioned by \nHIC. (Response to FORM) \nHIC refused to engage in any dialogue with Applicant regarding his property. HIC \ncancelled and charged off the timeshare in September 2018 and foreclosed in February \n2020. Applicant was never notified the property was foreclosed until May 2023, which is \nwhy he denied the property was foreclosed in his SOR answer. It took more than a year \nof multiple phone calls and emails to HIC before it acknowledged the foreclosure. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney engaged HIC and it could not produce evidence that Applicant had \nbeen notified of the foreclosure. Applicant had attempted to surrender the property over \nseveral years and HIC never mentioned to him the account was closed and the property \nforeclosed. HIC is the subject of multiple complaints through the Better Business Bureau \nrelated to predatory practices. (Item 4; AE 10, 11) \nApplicant recently participated in another financial counseling course. He provided \nnumerous letters reflecting his outstanding character and ability to protect classified \ninformation, and asserting he is not a threat to national security. He is described as \ndiligent, honest, reliable, and loyal. He is a person who exercises good judgment and \nintegrity. He is devoted to his church and volunteers his time and talents to the community. \nHe is a trusted employee with the highest personal and professional standards.  (Item 2-\nenclosure 3, 4,5, 6, 10; AE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent credit cards, accounts, and a timeshare \nproperty. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a period when he was required to \nmove his residence to remain employed. He maintained two households during this \nperiod. His salary was reduced. He had rental property and the tenants moved, thereby \nreducing his income. He overextended himself by using credit cards, which eventually \nbecame unmanageable. In addition, he had a timeshare that clearly had predatory \nbusiness practices. His wife lost her job. Her parents lived with them. The pandemic also \nimpacted their family with his father-in-law passing away from the virus. These were \nconditions beyond his control. Applicant began addressing his delinquent debts before he \nreceived the SOR. He participated in two debt-resolution programs and financial \ncounseling. He has paid all of the debts alleged in the SOR, except the timeshare. \nRegarding the debt for the timeshare alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, I find their failure to discuss \nresolving the timeshare mortgage, failure to notify Applicant of its foreclosure, and their \nreputation regarding their business practices rises to the level of being predatory. I find in \nhis favor on this debt. \nBased on all of the evidence, I conclude the circumstances that caused Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The conditions that resulted in his financial problems \nwere beyond his control and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has \nparticipated in financial counseling and there are clear indications his financial problems \nare under control. He made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts and has done so. He \nprovided sufficient evidence to address the legitimacy of the timeshare debt, and I resolve \nit in his favor. All of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions considering all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Although I have found in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor on the debts alleged, I have some concerns about his failure to timely file his income \ntax returns for two years. I believe Applicant will be more diligent in the future and ensure \nthey are filed timely so as not to impact his clearance eligibility. He has met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant successfully mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

(Tr. 31-33, 43.) \n1.a. Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized for mental-health treatment for two \nweeks starting January 22, 2020. She had been arrested by police on that day because \nshe had been knocking on random peoples\u2019 doors attempting to gain entry. She was \nthreatening to \u201cstomp\u201d the wife of an ex-boyfriend of hers from 40 years before and teach \nthat person a lesson. During the course of the hospitalization she was diagnosed with \nSchizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. After two weeks she was able to be discharged \nin fair condition. (Government Exhibit 2 at 5-6, Exhibit 3; Tr. 30-31, 33-37.) \nThe intake notes stated the following: \nDuring the interview the patient [Applicant] was hyperverbal, quite \ndisorganized with labile mood, laughing inappropriately, continued to make \nthreatening remarks to others and at this point is too unpredictable and \nconfused to be safely managed at the lower level of care. (Government \nExhibit 3 at 1.) \nApplicant testified that she had little to no memory of the incidents that led to her \ninvoluntary hospitalization. She testified that before those incidents she had been feeling \nill and believes she threw up her medications. She also did not describe in detail the \ncourse of hospitalization. (Tr. 26-27, 33, 38-42.) \n1.b. Applicant received an evaluation from MHC in November 2021. The consultant \ninterviewed Applicant, conducted a screening test, and reviewed her mental health \nrecords. She diagnosed Applicant as suffering from a Schizoaffective Disorder. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nMHC\u2019s \nreport stated the following under the heading BEHAVIORAL \nOBSERVATIONS: \nUpon initiation of the interview, [Applicant] presented with an upbeat, \nchipper, and playful tone. Her demeanor was highly childlike, particularly \napparent through her use of language. Her affect was incongruent with what \nwould be expected given the circumstances for the assessment. She \nappeared disoriented and disconnected at various points throughout the \ninterview, and her thoughts were highly disorganized. Her thoughts were \noften difficult to follow, and many of her narratives required clarification. \nWhile [Applicant] expressed a history of engagement in therapy, self-\nreflection, and healing, she appears to present with limited insight \nsurrounding her mental health functioning. Though she spoke openly about \na trauma history, her awareness of her history of psychotic symptoms was \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nminimal. She has a history of impaired judgment, stemming from apparent \ndistortions in perception, information gathered through the clinical interview \nwas disorganized and periodically incoherent, contributing to difficulty \nestablishing a clear understanding of [Applicant\u2019s] mental health history. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 8.) \nMHC stated the following under the heading DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS AND \nPROGNOSIS: \nThe assessment sought to clarify [Applicant\u2019s] current level of emotional \nfunctioning, given her recent inpatient hospitalization in 2020. While \n[Applicant\u2019s] mental health appeared to decompensate in response to\nincreasing stressors surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the assessment\nrevealed longstanding patterns of instability in mood, distortion in \nperception, and interpersonal issues for [Applicant]. She is currently actively \nengaged in psychiatric care with a nurse practitioner, and [Applicant] is \ntaking her medications as prescribed in order to manage her mood and \npsychotic symptoms. It is noteworthy that she presents with incredibly \nlimited insight around her history of psychosis, which is common for\nindividuals with delusional ideation. At present, [Applicant] denied any \ncurrent symptoms to suggest an active mood episode, such as a \ndepressive, manic, or hypomanic state. As psychotic symptoms were \nevident in the absence of a mood episode, the current assessment supports\nher previous diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder. Though she does not\nappear to be at an acute risk for acting erratically or harming herself, she \ncontinues to present with disorganized thinking and distortions in perception\nthat warrant concern regarding her current functioning. Her prognosis is fair, \ngiven the nature of her mental health issues. (Government Exhibit 2 at 10.)\n(Emphasis in original.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMHC stated her CONSLUSIONS: \nBased on information gathered through the assessment, [Applicant] \npresents with a significant mental health history with active indications of \ndelusional ideation and disorganization in thinking. Due to her distortions in \nperception, there are considerable concerns about her judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness at this time, as well as her long-term prognosis. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 10.) \nApplicant began seeing an Adult Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (NP) \nafter her discharge from the mental hospital in January 2020. NP\u2019s CV is Applicant Exhibit \nK. NP prescribes medication for Applicant to attempt to control her condition. NP sees \nApplicant every one to two months for medication control and therapy.

These symptoms have \npersisted since childhood in varying capacities. \nShe has been treated for these symptoms with psychotropic medications \nand individual therapy and has developed great insight over time. She has \nlearned to manage her symptoms, many of which have completely \nsubsided, in a way that has allowed her to live a comfortable and successful \nlife with no known deficits in her employment or personal life to date. \nNP submitted a second statement after the hearing. (Applicant Exhibit L.) The \ndocument stated in pertinent part: \nAfter review of document Guideline I, it is in my assessment that [Applicant] \nhas maintained steady medication and treatment compliance voluntarily \nsince her release from the hospital in January 2020. Her psychiatric \nsymptoms have remained well controlled and in remission because of her \ncommitment to this treatment. She meets with me monthly and prognosis is \ngood. \nBased on her presentation and treatment progress over the past 2\u00bd years, \nI have no reason to believe that she would experience a relapse of \nsymptoms similar to the episode experienced in January 2020 as long as \nshe maintains compliance with medications and mental health treatment. \nApplicant testified that the incident in January 2020 was a \u201cSingular incident. One-\ntime thing.\u201d She further testified that nothing like that had occurred before or after the \nincident. (Tr. 44.) \nIn conclusion Applicant stated, \u201cI believe I deserve a Security Clearance. I\u2019ve done \nnothing wrong, and I\u2019m a credit to having a Security Clearance.

(Applicant Exhibits A, B, C, D, F, and\nH.) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions may be applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nThe record shows that Applicant has been suffering from severe and chronic \nmental health issues, including depression, for decades. Applicant, MHC, and NP, all \nagree on that point. AG \u00b6 28(a) applies to this case. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2021 MHC found that Applicant had a condition that may impair her judgment, \nstability, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nApplicant was involuntarily committed for two weeks of inpatient mental health \ntreatment after she engaged in violent and bizarre behavior. AG \u00b6 28(c) applies. \nThe Government has met its burden under the Directive to establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAs stated, Applicant has been suffering with severe mental health issues for many \nyears. However, other than that bare statement there is little evidence in the record to \nshow the extent of the problems and the care Applicant had been receiving prior to her \ninvoluntary hospitalization in 2020. \nMHC expressed several serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s stability in her well-\nreasoned report. Of particular concern was Applicant\u2019s apparent inability to rationally \ndiscuss her situation and treatment in depth. I agree. The majority of her answers to \nquestions by her counsel, Department Counsel, and me, were monosyllabic. When asked \nspecific questions about providers before NP, Applicant was unable to provide \ninformation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNP stated that Applicant\u2019s symptoms are well controlled with medication, but that \nis a conclusory statement and insufficient under the circumstances. The record is bereft \nof progress or interview notes that would show the extent of Applicant\u2019s alleged progress \nsince her hospitalization. \nMHC wrote an extensive report that discussed several issues concerning \nApplicant\u2019s mental health, in particular her history of disorganized thinking and distortions \nin perception. NP\u2019s statements did not sufficiently overcome the conclusions of MHC. \nThe strictures of the Guidelines as written require more from Applicant in terms of \nconsistency of treatment and a current and favorable prognosis that rebuts the current \nreport by the Government\u2019s MHC. Given the state of the record I cannot find that Applicant \nhas sufficiently mitigated the security concerns raised by the evidence in this case. \nGuideline I is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. At the present time, the record \nevidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all but two of the allegations in the SOR, as further discussed below. For each allegation, she provided a brief explanation. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old. She is married with two adult daughters. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. She served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (USAFR) from 1986 until 2013, when she retired as a technical sergeant (E-6). (Items 3, 9) She was on active duty from about 2009 to 2012 and returned to work in the defense industry in 2013. She has worked for various defense contractors since then. She has worked for her current employer since November 2017. She has maintained a clearance since her time in the USAFR. (Items 3, 9) This case resulted from her 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) accessed through the DOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation Program. That CBR noted that Applicant had incurred over $80,000 in delinquent debts.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 14, 2020. \nOn September 29, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF took this action under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 30, 2022, and requested a decision by \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) based \non the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. She provided a recent credit \nreport, which I have admitted, without objection, as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. \nOn February 24, 2023, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 9. \nDOHA mailed the FORM to Applicant the same day, and she received it on March 13, \n2023. She was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit materials in response, \nand to object to the Government\u2019s evidence. \nOn or about May 2, 2023, having received no response from Applicant, the case \nwas forwarded to the DOHA hearing office. The case was assigned to me on June 1, \n2023. Government Items 1 and 2, the SOR and the Answer, are the pleadings in the case. \nGovernment Items 3 through 9 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all but two of the allegations in the SOR, as further discussed \nbelow. For each allegation, she provided a brief explanation. Her admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. She is married with two adult daughters. She earned her \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. She served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (USAFR) from 1986 \nuntil 2013, when she retired as a technical sergeant (E-6). (Items 3, 9) She was on active \nduty from about 2009 to 2012 and returned to work in the defense industry in 2013. She \nhas worked for various defense contractors since then. She has worked for her current \nemployer since November 2017. She has maintained a clearance since her time in the \nUSAFR. (Items 3, 9) \nThis case resulted from her 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) accessed through the \nDOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation Program. That CBR noted that Applicant had incurred over \n$80,000 in delinquent debts. (Item 5) \nApplicant disclosed on her January 2020 SCA that she had unfiled federal income \ntax returns, state and federal income tax debts, and about $90,000 in federal student \nloans, for which she said she was on a bi-weekly payment plan. (Item 3) She discussed \nher various debts at length in her September 2020 background interview. (Item 9) \nIn the fall of 2021, Applicant responded to an interrogatory from the DOD CAF \nabout her various debts, chiefly her federal student loans and her federal taxes. Her \nresponse is undated, but the documentation she provided from the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) is dated in September and October 2021.

Applicant \nacknowledged that her admitted debts had not been paid. (Items 1, 2; AE A) The non-tax \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by CBRs in the record, from August 2019, \nAugust 2020, January 2022, and February 2023. (Items 5 \u2013 9) The tax debts and unfiled \nreturns alleged are established by Applicant\u2019s 2021 Interrogatory Response. (Item 4) \nApplicant explained in her background interview that her tax and other financial \nissues began after she retired from her most recent period of active duty as an activated \nAir Force Reservist, in 2013. She made a good income on active duty and found it difficult \nto replicate that income in civilian life. She began working as a part-time contractor and \ndid not have health insurance. She and her husband incurred medical debts they could \nnot afford to repay. She also used federal student loans to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nDue to her underemployment and limited income at the time, she depleted her federal \nThrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement pension. Since she was not over the age of 59\u00bd, \nshe had to pay penalties and taxes on the withdrawals. State and federal income tax \ndebts resulted. (Item 9; Item 4 at 12) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m concern Applicant\u2019s unresolved federal student loans, \nwhich total $76,645. (Items 5-7) The SOR alleges that the debts \u201cwere in delinquent status \nprior to being placed in forbearance due to the pandemic.\u201d (Item 1) In her Answer, \nApplicant admitted these debts and acknowledged that she had not made any student \nloan payments. She asserted that the garnishment of her student loan payments was \nstopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Item 1) \nApplicant\u2019s CBRs from August 2020 and January 2022 show several federal \nstudent loan accounts as being past-due and in collection status. (Item 6 at 7-10, Item 7 \nat 2-5) A February 2023 CBR submitted by the Government shows that Applicant has 13 \nUSDOE loans, totaling the same $76,645 as alleged. Those loans are listed as \u201cPays \naccount as agreed.\u201d (Item 8) \nThe U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) paused collection of federal student \nloans beginning in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This likely explains why \nthey are currently in good standing, since Applicant acknowledged that she has not made \nany payments on them. However, the USDOE\u2019s COVID-19 student loan forbearance \nprogram is ending. On September 1, 2023, interest resumes, and payments will be due \nbeginning in October 2023. See https://www.usa.gov/covid-student-loan-help. \nApplicant also asserted in her Answer, without further detail and without \ndocumented corroboration, that \u201csubmittal of Debt Forgiveness has not been processed.\u201d \nThis is probably a reference to President Biden\u2019s proposed plan to forgive several \nthousand dollars of many borrowers\u2019 federal student loans. That plan was held to be \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Biden v. Nebraska, No. 22-506, __ U.S.__, June \n30, 2023 (available on the Supreme Court\u2019s website, https://www.supremecourt.gov) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant explained in her September 2020 background interview that she dropped \nout of graduate school in 2015 and was supposed to begin repayments on her loans soon \nthereafter, but she only made payments \u201chere and there\u201d and her loans soon became \ndelinquent. She asserted, without corroborating evidence, that she had been paying $379 \nmonthly at the time her payments were halted due to the COVID-19 debt relief program. \n(Item 9 at 4-5) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n ($1,472), 1.o ($185), and 1.p ($791), 1.r ($579), 1.s ($268), and 1.t \n($53) are past-due medical debts that have been placed for collection. (Items 6, 7) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s. I construe her failure to respond to SOR \n\u00b6 1.p as a denial. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.t on the basis that it had been paid, without \nproviding corroborating evidence. \nThe debt at SOR \u00b6 1.o ($185) is not established by the record, although one \nunalleged medical debt in the amount of $180 is listed on several CBRs. (Item 5, Item 6 \nat 11) As of January 2022, that unalleged debt shows a zero balance. (Item 7 at 5). SOR \n\u00b6 1.o is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.q ($676) is a debt placed for collection to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA). (Item 5 at 2 for $676, Item 6 at 11 for $1,106) Applicant admitted the debt \nand said she was unsure of the balance. She explained in her background interview that \nthe debt is an overpayment of GI Bill education benefits that she believed had been paid. \nShe did not proffer any evidence corroborating the purported payment. The debt does not \nappear on more recent CBRs. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u ($1,769) and 1.v ($2,999) concern past-due federal income tax debt \nfor tax years (TY) 2020 and 2017, respectively. (Item 4 at 18, 28-32) Applicant admitted \nthat these debts have not been paid. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x allege that Applicant failed to file her 2018 and 2019 state \nand federal income tax returns on time, as required, and that those returns remain unfiled. \nIRS records reflect that they have \u201cno record of return filed\u201d for those years. (Item 4 at 23, \n27) Applicant answered both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x by stating, \u201cI admit that this debt [sic] \nhas not been paid [sic].\u201d (Item 2) I construe her answer as admitting both allegations. She \nprovided no documentation that she has filed any of the federal or state  returns for TY \n2018 or 2019. \nApplicant disclosed tax debt on her SCA and discussed her taxes in her \nbackground interview. She was asked in the DOHA interrogatory to provide copies of her \nstate and federal tax returns from 2012-2019. (Item 4 at 2) Only the state returns for TY \n2018 and 2019 are alleged in the SOR. It is not clear from the record why Applicant has \nfailed to file those returns. \nBut for a December 2022 CBR (AE A), Applicant provided no documentation with \nher Answer about her recent finances, and she provided no documentation related to any \nsubsequent debt payments, tax payments, or tax filings.

She did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM, so she provided no updated \ninformation since her Answer. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant experienced financial problems beginning in about 2013, after she left \nactive duty and retired from the USAFR. She had difficulty finding full-time employment \nand health insurance. She used federal student loans to pursue and complete a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. She also depleted the funds in her TSP retirement plan, which led to \nunintended tax consequences. All these factors led to the delinquent debts and tax issues \nin the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) all apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

None of her alleged debts \nhave been paid or resolved, and she has unfiled tax returns as well. She has not \nestablished good-faith compliance with tax payments or tax filing requirements and has \nnot established a track record of steady payments towards any of her debts. Her federal \nstudent loans are not currently in delinquent status due to the COVID-19 forbearance \nprogram, which mitigates her inaction since March 2020. However, she did not proffer \nevidence sufficient to establish a track record of payments and financial responsibility in \naddressing her significant federal student loan debt before March 2020, and her student \nloans remain outstanding. Her various debts and tax issues continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts may have begun during a period of \ntransition from the Air Force but that was several years ago. At this point her debts and \ntax issues are largely due to her own failures to address them responsibly and not due to \ncircumstances beyond her control. \nApplicant has not demonstrated that she is acting in good faith. She provided no \ndocumentation to suggest that she has taken concrete steps to address her debts \nresponsibly or to file her outstanding returns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to/ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has not provided enough evidence to \nshow that she is acting responsibly in addressing her long-term delinquent debts and \nstudent loans. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s continued eligibility for access to classified information. She did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for continued \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He also worked part-time for another government contractor \nfrom 2018 until November 2021. He married in 2003, but his wife passed away in \nNovember 2022.

He has \ntaken some college and technical courses, but he has not earned another degree or \ncertificate. He served on active duty in the Navy from 1998 until 2006, earning an \nhonorable discharge. He served in the Navy Reserve from 2006 until 2012, when he \nreturned to active duty with the Navy until July 2020, when he was released with a bad-\nconduct discharge. (Tr. 22-27, 55-57; GE 1, 6) \nIn April and May 2018, while working at the DOD Inspector General (DOD IG) \nHotline Center, on two separate occasions, Applicant used his cell phone to take under-\nthe-dress photographs of two of his female colleagues (collectively the \u201cvictims\u201d) without \ntheir knowledge or consent. One of the victims notified the U.S. Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service (NCIS), which opened an investigation into the incident. Based \nupon the NCIS investigation, the Navy charged him under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ) Article 120c (other sexual misconduct: indecent viewing, visual \nrecording, or broadcasting). In 2019, after a court-martial, he pleaded guilty and was \nconvicted of this charge. He was sentenced to eight months confinement and reduction \nin rank. He was released with a bad-conduct discharge. In SOR \u00b6 1.a, the Government \nalleged Applicant\u2019s 2018 behavior in taking the photographs. In SOR \u00b6 2.a, it alleged his \nconviction and sentence pursuant to UCMJ Article 120c. It also alleged a violation of \nUCMJ Article 92, failure to obey an order or regulation charge and conviction and his \nbad-conduct discharge in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In the Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. Other than his \nadmission, there is no evidence of a 2019 UCMJ Article 92 charge or conviction. (Tr. \n18-21; 27-32; Answer; GE 1-3, 6; AE A) \nApplicant claimed that he was going through a bad time between 2015 and 2018. \nHe claimed he and his wife were having marital problems. He claimed he was \ndissatisfied with his job and did not want to be there. He claimed that there was nothing \nsexual about the pictures he took, but that he was acting out to get caught. He thought \nthat if he got in trouble, the Navy would move him to a different role. He was having \ntrouble with his life and did not know how to handle it. He claimed his time in \nconfinement gave him clarity and he is now in a better place. He claimed that he took \n\u201cmultiple hours\u201d of behavioral counseling where he learned that he had post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He did not specify the dates of his counseling \nsessions. He did not provide documentation related to this counseling, a diagnosis, or a \nprognosis. He claimed that he now understands how to appropriately deal with stress, \nand that he will not engage in this type of behavior again. (Tr. 18-21; Answer) \nSometime in the summer of 2017, Applicant filmed his wife while she was \nunclothed in her bedroom without her knowledge or consent.

Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant filming his wife \nwithout her knowledge or consent, will not be considered for disqualification purposes; \nhowever, it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; in \nconsidering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in \napplying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, \n2017)). (Tr. 32-35; GE 2) \nIn about April 2018, Applicant was counseled at work for making inappropriate \ncomments to a female colleague regarding her appearance. His inappropriate \ncomments made his female colleague feel uncomfortable, so she filed a complaint \nagainst him. Applicant\u2019s supervisor told him that he would be reassigned if anything \nsimilar happened again. The Government did not allege this information in the SOR. \n(GE 2) \nWhile Applicant claimed to be remorseful for his actions, he also deflected the \nblame and responsibility for his actions to others. He claimed the court-martial process \nwas unfair as he was not allowed to tell his side of the story. He claimed that he had \nbeen caught up in the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement and was judged more harshly than \nappropriate because of the timing of his offenses. He claimed that the victims were \ncoerced into requesting that he receive a harsher sentence than they otherwise might \nhave. He also claimed that he would not receive a fair outcome from his security \nclearance adjudication. In short, he casts himself as the victim and has not fully taken \nresponsibility for his illegal actions. (Answer; AE A) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent financial accounts \ntotaling approximately $29,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.f). Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and 1.e. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. Despite his denials, the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f are established by the Government\u2019s 2020, 2021, and \n2023 credit reports. (SOR; Answer; GE 4-7) \nThe judgments entered in April 2018 and January 2020 in favor of Applicant\u2019s \nhomeowner\u2019s association alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b have not been resolved. \nApplicant claimed that he made a payment of about $4,000 toward these judgments \nsometime in 2022. He also claimed that he is paying a little bit extra towards these \nobligations every month. He provided no documentation to corroborate these payments. \nHe is unsure how he fell behind on payments to his homeowner\u2019s association but \nsuspected his wife was supposed to pay this obligation and failed to do so. He claimed \nhe will continue to pay a little extra every month until these judgments are resolved. (Tr. \n20, 35-38, 60-61; Answer; GE 8) \nThe delinquent car loan in the amount of $6,499 alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c has not \nbeen resolved.

He provided no documentation about the resolution of this debt. (Tr. 20, \n38-43, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7, 9) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $2,927 alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d has not \nbeen resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not open this account and he disputed it \nwith the credit reporting agencies several times. The account was opened in September \n2015. He claimed that his wife had power of attorney for him while he was deployed and \nmay have opened it without his knowledge. The last time he deployed was between \nFebruary and October 2014. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his \ndisputes with the credit reporting agencies or the creditor, nor did he offer any other \nresolution of this debt. The Government\u2019s 2020, 2021, and 2023 credit reports do not \nreflect a dispute with respect to this account. This account appears on all three credit \nreports.

Applicant claimed that he took out this loan to purchase a car for his wife \nbecause she could not afford to pay for it herself. He opened the account in April 2017 \nand last made a payment on it in July 2019. He claimed that he did not know the loan \nwas delinquent because his wife was receiving the statements for it. He also claimed \nthat he could not afford to pay for the vehicle, but he agreed to open the account for his \nwife as an act of kindness. He claimed that he will pay this account through payment \narrangements when he is able to do so. (Tr. 20, 44-45, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7) \nThe delinquent telecommunications account in the amount of $2,027 alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 3.f has been resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not open this account. He \nclaimed that he disputed it with the credit reporting agencies. Although he did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his dispute, the debt no longer appears on his \n2023 credit report. While this account\u2019s absence on a subsequent credit report could be \nfor reasons other than a favorable resolution, his claimed dispute, combined with the \nabsence of the account on a subsequent credit report, provide sufficient evidence of a \nfavorable resolution. (Tr. 20, 45-47, 58-59) \nApplicant owes the IRS about $900 in delinquent federal income taxes for the \n2018 tax year. He owed about $3,000 until 2022, when he made a payment of about \n$2,100. These delinquent federal taxes were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48) \nApplicant earns between $83,000 and $84,000 in annual wages. He earns about \n$5,200 per month. He receives a monthly Veterans Affairs (VA) disability payment of \n$2,215. While working his part-time job, he also earned about $22 to $23 per hour for \nthe 16-30 hours per week he worked.

(Tr. 25-26, 53-58) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment.  \nApplicant engaged in criminal sexual behavior when he took under-the-dress \nphotographs of two female colleagues. He was convicted and spent time in \nconfinement. His actions, while surreptitious, were performed in public and reflected a \nlack of judgment. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable and the burden \nshifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance, with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nWhile Applicant last engaged in this behavior almost five years ago, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence that it is unlikely to recur and that it does not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He engaged in this behavior \nmultiple times, including with his wife prior to the incident with his colleagues. He \nengaged in this behavior because he was experiencing stress at work and with his \nmarriage. Neither of these circumstances is unusual. He has minimized the severity of \nhis actions and refused to accept full responsibility for his deceitful and dehumanizing \nbehavior. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. \nApplicant provided no evidence that either his employer or family are aware of \nhis criminal behavior. Information of a criminal and sexual nature such as this, if made \nknown, could be embarrassing and could result in a loss of employment. It could \ntherefore be used as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6 14(c) does not \napply. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was not private or consensual. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. \nWhile Applicant claimed that he underwent behavioral counseling, he provided \nno evidence that he is currently enrolled or that he completed a treatment program. He \npresented no evidence of a treatment plan or a favorable diagnosis. AG \u00b6 14(e) does \nnot apply. None of the sexual behavior mitigating factors are applicable. The sexual \nbehavior security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s behavior are not mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nIn 2018, Applicant engaged in criminal conduct when he took under-the-dress \nphotographs of his colleagues. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to a UCMJ Article 120 charge \nrelated to this behavior. As a result of this behavior, he was discharged from the Navy \nfor bad conduct. He was not charged with or convicted of a crime under UCMJ Article \n92. I find in his favor with respect to that portion of the allegation under Guideline J. \nOtherwise, the evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor the reasons set forth in the analysis of AG \u00b6 14(b), Applicant provided \ninsufficient evidence that his criminal behavior is unlikely to recur. For those same \nreasons, his behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \nThe almost five years that have passed without recurrence of criminal activity \nprovide some evidence of successful rehabilitation. Applicant provided no evidence of \nrestitution, job training, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. He has taken some technical classes since his conviction. AG \u00b6 32(d) \npartially applies. However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not compel a \nfavorable adjudication. Instead, I must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide \nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or vice versa. Despite the \nfive years that have passed without criminal conduct, given the seriousness of his crime \nand his failure to fully take responsibility for it, I cannot find that the criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has five delinquent debts totaling about $27,000. Several of \nthese debts have been delinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nprovide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAt the outset, Applicant has successfully disputed the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 3.f. I \nfind in his favor with respect to that allegation. Applicant\u2019s other financial delinquencies \nare ongoing and therefore recent. He has an additional delinquent federal tax debt that \nis not listed in the SOR. His behavior in failing to pay his debts is not infrequent. The \nevidence does not show that his debts are resolved or are under control. He has not \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. I cannot find his financial issues are \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial issues arose because he was incarcerated for \ncommitting a crime and because he failed to pay adequate attention to his finances. \nThese conditions were not beyond his control. Despite his assertion that he has made \npayments on some of the SOR debts, he provided no documents to corroborate these \npayments. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2016). AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nIn addition to the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 3.f, Applicant disputed the legitimacy of the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 3.d. He claimed he never opened the account listed in SOR \u00b6 3.d. He did \nnot provide documentary corroboration that he disputed the debt with the creditor or the \ncredit reporting agencies. The Government\u2019s credit reports do not show that Applicant \ndisputed this debt. As opposed to the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.f, the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.d appears \nin a credit report subsequent to his alleged dispute. He has not provided sufficient \nevidence of his actions to resolve his dispute with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 3.d. AG \u00b6 20(e) \npartially applies as it applies to the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.f. None of the other financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D, J, and F in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances and his military service, despite \nreceiving a bad-conduct discharge. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nmitigate the sexual behavior, criminal conduct, or financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (Except for the \nalleged UCMJ Article 92 charge, \nwhich I find for Applicant) \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He reported the following periods of unemployment: January 2010 to July 2014; November 2018 to February 2019, and; March 2020 to August 2020. (Items 3 and 7.) The August 3, 2022 SOR alleged three delinquent accounts, two federal student loans totaling $60,090 and a delinquent auto loan for $8,840. (Item 1.) Applicant denied those allegations. (Item 2.) Applicant attached to his Answer an August 15, 2022 letter to him from the U.S. Department of Education confirming a defaulted student loan rehabilitation agreement, whereby he will pay $708 per month beginning on October 2, 2022. His signed rehabilitation agreement was included with his Response. Failure to make those payments will result in the loans becoming delinquent. He did not submit documents showing any payments made under the rehabilitation agreement. (Item 2 and Response.) The student loans were assigned for collection in December 2013. ((Items 4 and 5.)

He was afforded 30 days after \nreceiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation.

The SOR and the Answer (Items 1 \nand 2, respectively) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on February 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 33 years old and is a college graduate (June 2013). He has never \nmarried and has no children. Since August 2020, he has been employed by a defense \ncontractor. (Item 3.) He reported the following periods of unemployment: January 2010 to \nJuly 2014; November 2018 to February 2019, and; March 2020 to August 2020. (Items 3 \nand 7.) \nThe August 3, 2022 SOR alleged three delinquent accounts, two federal student \nloans totaling $60,090 and a delinquent auto loan for $8,840. (Item 1.) Applicant denied \nthose allegations. (Item 2.) \nApplicant attached to his Answer an August 15, 2022 letter to him from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education confirming a defaulted student loan rehabilitation agreement, \nwhereby he will pay $708 per month beginning on October 2, 2022. His signed \nrehabilitation agreement was included with his Response. Failure to make those \npayments will result in the loans becoming delinquent. He did not submit documents \nshowing any payments made under the rehabilitation agreement. (Item 2 and Response.) \nThe student loans were assigned for collection in December 2013. ((Items 4 and 5.) \nApplicant attached to his Answer an August 23, 2022 letter to him from his auto \nloan creditor confirming a settlement agreement, whereby he will pay 35 monthly \npayments of $185 to resolve the debt for less than the full balance. In his Response, he \nsubmitted a cancelled check showing a December 11, 2022 payment of $185 under this \nagreement. If all required payments are not made, the account will not be considered \nsettled. (Item 2 and Response.) The auto loan was assigned for collection in January \n2014. (Item 4.) \nApplicant attributed his three delinquent debts to periods of unemployment. (Item \n7.) He did not specify which period or periods of unemployment caused his financial \ndifficulties. He is \u201ccurrently financially stable\u201d and \u201cis capable of meeting obligations.\u201d \nThere is \u201cnobody that would question [his] ability to live within [his] means.\u201d (Item 7.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are\nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) through 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts \nwere assigned to collections about 10 years ago. That is admittedly quite some \ntime ago. They have, however, remained in collections since that time, even \nthough he claims to be \u201cfinancially stable\u201d and \u201ccapable of meeting [his] \nobligations.\u201d He apparently elected not to meet his SOR debt obligations over \nthose 10 years. That casts doubt on his current reliability. His debts are not \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d). Since the SOR was \nissued on August 3, 2022, Applicant has been quite busy. By August 15, 2022, he \nhad arranged to have his two delinquent student loans put into rehabilitation. And \njust over a week later, on August 23, 2022, he arranged an installment settlement \nagreement with his auto creditor and made one payment in December under that \nagreement. \nIt is difficult not to conclude that Applicant\u2019s sudden attention to his \ndelinquent student loans and his delinquent auto loan was prompted by the \nissuance of the SOR. Timing like this is pertinent, as the Appeals Board has \nobserved: \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having been \nplaced on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness . . . are in jeopardy may \nbe disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests are not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n     \nat stake.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018). His debts are \nnot mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(d). \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 c.:\n \n  \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

She admitted the SOR \nallegations with additional comments. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. \nThe SOR allegations are established through her admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. (SOR; Answer, GE 3-7) \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in about 2000 when her cohabitant was injured \nand was not able to work. Later, despite being able to work, he was not employed and \nwas not looking for a job. Having only one income, Applicant paid her bills while she \nwas able, but in about 2001 she could no longer afford to do so. She filed a petition in \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2001 and received a Chapter 7 discharge in March \n2002. She also ended the relationship with her son\u2019s father during this time. (Tr. 45-47; \nAnswer; GE 6) \nAfter her fresh start in March 2002, she began opening additional accounts. She \nlargely stayed current on those accounts until about 2015 when she had some \nunforeseen expenses. She opened the unsecured loan listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a to \nconsolidate some of her credit cards. However, in about 2016, she again began having \ntrouble paying her bills. Her son and mother, who were living together, each had acute \nmental health issues. In about 2016, her cohabitant cheated on her. From June 2019 \nuntil June 2020, she used a credit repair company. Shortly after she stopped using this \ncompany, to protect her son\u2019s mental health and provide for a place where she could \nlive away from her cohabitant if needed, she rented an apartment where her son lives \nand where she can stay. She also pays for a significant portion of her son\u2019s living \nexpenses. (Tr. 35-37, 47-50; Answer; GE 2-5, 7) \nIn 2018, Applicant developed a rare form of glaucoma that required expensive \nmedications and procedures and contributed to her financial strain. Given these health \nand family related added expenses, she could not afford to pay some of her other \nfinancial obligations, including the SOR debts.

She enrolled the debts listed in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e in this program. Through this debt consolidation company, as of \nJanuary 2023, she had paid about half of the agreed upon settlement amount on the \ndebt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, she also claimed that she did not recognize this debt \nand does not believe it is hers. She has not disputed it with the creditor. In 2019, the \ncredit repair company disputed it on her behalf with the credit reporting agencies. There \nis no evidence of the resolution of the dispute; however, the debt does not appear on \nthe August 2022 or April 2023 credit reports. There is no evidence that the debt \nconsolidation company has made any payments on the remaining enrolled debts. \nHowever, the enrolled debts will be paid according to the terms of her agreement with \nthe debt consolidation company. (Tr. 51-53, 67; Answer; GE 1-4; AE A) \nInstead of simply waiting on the debt consolidation company, Applicant settled \nthe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f by contacting the creditors directly and\npaying less than the full amount. She provided documentary evidence of these\nsettlements. In October 2022, she contacted the collection agency and the creditor of\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e to try to \n \n settle that debt, but she claimed that both stated that they\nwere no longer collecting the debt because the statute of limitations had lapsed. This\ndebt is scheduled to be paid pursuant to the terms of her debt consolidation agreement.\nShe claimed that she contacted the creditor of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but the creditor\nhad no record of her in their system, so she has not paid anything on that debt. (Tr. 53-\n57, 77-80; Answer; GE 2-5, 7; AE B-E, H)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant owed delinquent federal and state income taxes for the 2021 tax year \nin the amounts of $9,918 and $2,327, respectively. She became delinquent on these \ntaxes because she could no longer claim her son as a deduction and did not have \nsufficient income withheld from her wages. While not alleged in the SOR, she also owed \nfederal taxes in the amounts of $4,112 for tax year 2019, $1,465 for tax year 2020, and \n$4,000 for tax year 2022. In April 2020, she made a payment arrangement to pay $200 \nper month on her delinquent federal taxes. As of June 2023, she has remained current \non her IRS payment plan. On June 1, 2023, she made a lump sum payment of $8,000 \nto the IRS. There is no evidence of the current amount she owes the IRS, but the latest \ndocumentary evidence Applicant provided reflected a balance of $461 for tax year 2019, \n$1,514 for tax year 2020, $10,570 for tax year 2021, and $4,000 for tax year 2022. \nThese balances do not reflect Applicant\u2019s June 1, 2023, $8,000 payment.

(Tr. \n59-60, 69-76, 81; Answer; GE 2; AE F-J) \nApplicant brings home about $4,000 per month in wages. Her cohabitant, with \nwhom she reconciled, brings home about $2,500 per month in wages. They share some \nof their earnings and expenses. She pays about $1,200 per month for her son\u2019s rent \nand living expenses. She does not pay any of the mortgage or rent where she resides. \nShe has about $3,000 in a savings account and about $100,000 in retirement accounts. \nShe claimed she has about $1,900 in surplus earnings at the end of each month. She \nspoke over the phone once with an advisor for a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand they went over her income and expenses and budgeting advice. (Tr. 35-37, 60-64; \nAnswer; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified that Applicant does well at work, has a strong \nwork ethic, and shows integrity. He believes that she can be entrusted with handling \nclassified information. Her son testified that her financial issues were usually due to \ncircumstances beyond her control. He noted that she is a good person, is altruistic, and \nhas always been good to him. Several family members, friends, and work colleagues \nprovided character reference letters on her behalf. They all referenced her honesty, \nintegrity, reliability, and they believe she would protect sensitive information. (Tr. 21-37; \nAnswer) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs evidenced by her 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and her other financial \ndelinquencies that began as early as 2015, Applicant has a history of being unable to \npay her debts. The above listed conditions are made applicable by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s 2001 bankruptcy petition and 2002 bankruptcy discharge occurred \nover 20 years ago. I find that this conduct occurred long enough ago and infrequently \nenough that it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) fully applies to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j. \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state income tax delinquencies were caused by her \nfailure to account for her tax withholdings from her wages.

Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to her delinquent \nfederal and state taxes. Apart from her delinquent taxes, Applicant\u2019s financial problems \narose because of domestic issues, her family\u2019s mental health problems, and her \nmedical issues. These conditions were largely beyond her control. To fully avail herself \nof AG \u00b6 20(b), she must also show that she acted responsibly under the circumstances \nwith respect to these debts. I find that her efforts in engaging a credit repair company, a \ndebt consolidation company, and contacting creditors to resolve debts through payment \nshow that she acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to the non-tax related SOR debts. \nWhile Applicant had a phone call with a credit counseling company, she \npresented insufficient evidence that this counseling was from a legitimate or credible \nsource, or that this single phone call provided meaningful financial counseling. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) only partially applies. \nApplicant made payment arrangements with the IRS and the relevant state \ntaxation authority. Her payments to the IRS began in 2020. She has consistently made \nher required monthly payments. She also made a significant lump sum payment from \nher retirement savings toward both debts. She claimed that she will use more money \nfrom her retirement savings to pay her remaining tax debt. I found her to be credible \nwhen she testified that she would resolve her tax debts with retirement savings, and her \n$8,000 payment from that source bolsters her reliability. She is paying on several of her \nother delinquent debts through a debt consolidation company, and she contacted other \ncreditors to make payments and settle SOR debts. For all but two of the remaining SOR \naccounts, she is either making payments or has satisfied those debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies. For the above stated reasons, AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to her tax delinquencies. \nWhile she has not made payments on the two remaining debts, she contacted the \ncreditors to try to make payment arrangements, but the creditors effectively would not \naccept her money based upon their internal policies. \nAs several of the mitigating conditions apply, I find that Applicant has mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. Her financial issues do not cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character evidence and good job performance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 62 years old. He graduated from high school and completed various certifications. He never married and has no children. He has been employed by a federal contractor since December 2020. Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2021. In it, he disclosed that from 1975 until April 2021 he used marijuana about once a week. He stated, \u201cUsed for pain relief, about \u00bd oz. per year in use.\u201d He stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because \u201ccould effect working on the Fed side of [X] business.\u201d (Item 3). X is Applicant\u2019s present employer. Applicant also disclosed in his SCA that he used cocaine periodically from 1975 to June 2017. He also said in his SCA that he quit using cocaine three years ago, which is inconsistent with the dates he provided. He used it weekly in the 1970s. He said, \u201cquit for many years then [sporadic]. I have quit with no plans to start again.\u201d (Item 3). He said the reason he stopped using cocaine was because it is \u201cbad for your health and it is bad for your career.\u201d (Item 3) Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2021.

There were no \nobjections to any of the evidence submitted and all exhibits are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old. He graduated from high school and completed various \ncertifications. He never married and has no children. He has been employed by a federal \ncontractor since December 2020. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2021. In \nit, he disclosed that from 1975 until April 2021 he used marijuana about once a week. He \nstated, \u201cUsed for pain relief, about \u00bd oz. per year in use.\u201d He stated he did not intend to \nuse marijuana in the future because \u201ccould effect working on the Fed side of [X] business.\u201d \n(Item 3). X is Applicant\u2019s present employer. \nApplicant also disclosed in his SCA that he used cocaine periodically from 1975 to \nJune 2017. He also said in his SCA that he quit using cocaine three years ago, which is \ninconsistent with the dates he provided. He used it weekly in the 1970s. He said, \u201cquit for \nmany years then [sporadic]. I have quit with no plans to start again.\u201d (Item 3). He said the \nreason he stopped using cocaine was because it is \u201cbad for your health and it is bad for \nyour career.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2021. He told \nthe investigator that he used marijuana from 1975 to 1985 and then resumed using it in \n2010 until April 2021. For the past ten years he used marijuana at home and before then \nhe used it while out with friends. His more recent use consisted of taking \u201ca hit\u201d before \nbed if he could not sleep. He purchased marijuana in the past seven years and his last \npurchase was June 2020. He purchased it through a friend. He purchased it so he could \nuse it to help him sleep. He said he did not intend to purchase marijuana in the future. He \ncontinues to socialize with friends who use marijuana, but said he does not use it with \nthem. He uses it alone. He told the investigator he stopped using it to keep his job. (Item \n4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he used cocaine monthly or quarterly. He would \nuse up to maybe half of a gram. It made him happy. He would use it at his house or his \nfriends or hanging out at a party. He has not purchased cocaine in the last seven years. \nHe explained his motivation was for acceptance. It was around him so he used it too. He \nused it with his brother and a friend. He said he no longer associates with those he used \ncocaine with. He did not elaborate on whether he no longer has contact with his brother. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe said he has changed his behavior to prevent future use. He did not explain what \nbehavior he changed or how. He said he quit using cocaine because he has grown \u201ctoo \nold\u201d to continue using it. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided details about the type of work \nhe does for his employer. He explained he does not talk about his work to anyone outside \nof work. He was willing to submit to random drug testing. He said his trustworthiness and \nreliability has never been questioned. He would never do anything to jeopardize his \ncareer, country, or family. He noted his willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. He stated, \u201cI am a law abiding citizen and although I have had issues in the \npast, I have worked very hard to turn those issues around. This includes going to AA \nmeetings, talking with professionals, seeking professional help as needed.\u201d He further \nstated that he does not intend to travel outside of the country. (AE A) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when applying the mitigating conditions \nand in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 1975 \nto April 2021. He possessed and used cocaine with varying frequency from about 1975 \nto June 2017. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant has a long history of using marijuana and cocaine. In his answer to the \nSOR and his FORM response, he did not provide significant amplifying information about \nhis marijuana and cocaine use and recent commitment to abstinence. He explained that \nhe quit using marijuana in April 2021 after moving to the federal side of employment in \norder to avoid adverse employment consequences. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply because \nApplicant has been using marijuana for 47 years and has only abstained for about 18 \nmonths. He said he stopped using marijuana for a period and then resumed in 2010 and \nused it as a sleep aide. He did not offer any evidence as to what he is using as an \nalternative sleep aide. I am not convinced, based on his past history, that he will not \nresume using marijuana. Applicant also continues to socialize with friends who use \nmarijuana. \nApplicant stated in his response to the FORM that he is a law-abiding citizen and \none who willingly complies with laws and regulations. Although in some states marijuana \nhas recently been legalized, use and possession of it was illegal for most of the 47 years \nhe was regularly using it. His illegal use of cocaine over a 40-year period certainly \ncontradicts his claim of willingly complying with rules and regulations. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s long history of illegal drug use, I am unable to find that his use was infrequent, \nor happened under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His significant history of using \nillegal drugs cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The email from Department Counsel forwarding HE IV is marked HE V. \nApplicant\u2019s email response is marked HE VI. \nHE IV includes reports and bulletins from the FBI, U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS), Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the DoD. (Items I-VI, \nXIII-XV) Applicant objected to the reports that post-date Applicant\u2019s conduct. That \nobjection is overruled, and I will take administrative notice of the reports and bulletins. \n(Items I-VI, XIII-XV) HE IV also includes a criminal complaint, supporting affidavits, U.S. \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) press releases, and an indictment. (Items VII-XII) \nApplicant objected to those documents. The objection to administrative notice of the \ncriminal complaint, supporting affidavits, DOJ press releases, and indictment (Items VII-\nXII) is sustained, and I will not take administrative notice of those documents. I am \nadmitting those documents as Government exhibits over Applicant\u2019s objection. They will \nkeep the same marking for clarification purposes.  \nWhile I did not accept all the documents for administrative notice, I accept and \nadopt the facts contained in those documents. The following is based on the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits and administrative notice documents. It documents what is \ncurrently known by the U.S. Government about Domestic Violent Extremists (DVEs), \nQAnon, and Three Percenters, identified in this decision also by the terms III%ers, \n3%ers, and Threepers. The following does not necessarily reflect what Applicant knew \nabout them when he took the actions alleged in the SOR. \nDomestic Violent Extremists  \nOne of the most significant terrorism threats to the United States we face today is \nposed by lone actors and small groups of individuals who commit acts of violence \nmotivated by a range of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances. Of these actors, \nDVEs represent one of the most persistent threats to the United States today. These \nindividuals are often radicalized online and look to conduct attacks with easily \naccessible weapons. Many of these violent extremists are motivated and inspired by a \nmix of ideological, socio-political, and personal grievances against their targets. \nA DVE is defined as an individual based and operating primarily within the United \nStates or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or \nother foreign power who seeks to further political or social goals, wholly or in part, \nthrough unlawful acts of force or violence dangerous to human life. \nDHS assesses that racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVEs) \nand militia violent extremists (MVEs) present the greatest DVE threats, with RMVEs \nbeing the most persistent and lethal threats to conduct mass-casualty attacks against \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncivilians, and MVEs typically targeting law enforcement and government personnel and \nfacilities. There have also been examples of both RMVEs and MVEs targeting critical \ninfrastructure, including against the electric sector, among others.  \nRMVEs and MVEs are the primary DVE concern, given the lethality of the threat \nand incident data. While specific motives vary, many attackers share common \nbehavioral characteristics and often connect with a grievance to justify their use of \nviolence. \nRMVEs and anti-authority/anti-government violent extremists are inspired by \nvarious violent extremist ideologies or perceived personal grievances, often cultivated \nthrough the consumption of online content or motivated by conspiracy theories. This \nresults in many DVEs with hybrid ideological beliefs that do not fit into traditional \ncategories. \nSome DVEs view the January 6th event as a success. Conspiracy theories, such \nas QAnon, likely will also inspire some DVEs and others to engage in more sporadic, \nlone actor or small cell violence against common DVE targets, including racial, ethnic, \nor religious minorities and institutions, law enforcement, and government officials and \nbuildings. \nIdeologies driven by such DVEs often are reinforced by a variety of online \ncontent, including conspiracy theories and political commentary they view as \ncontroversial. Current events that DVEs perceive as infringing on their worldviews often \ncontribute to periods of increased ideologically motivated violence, including recently \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide lawful protests. \nThe Intelligence Community assesses that DVEs exploit a variety of popular \nsocial media platforms, smaller websites with targeted audiences, and encrypted chat \napplications to recruit new adherents, plan and rally support for in-person actions, and \ndisseminate materials that contribute to radicalization and mobilization to violence. \nThe FBI warned that the mere advocacy of political or social positions, political \nactivism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophical embrace of violent tactics \nmay not constitute extremism and may be constitutionally protected. (GE 4 at 137; Item \nIII) \nThree Percenters (III%ers, 3%ers, or Threepers) \nThe definition of Three Percenter has evolved over the last three-plus years. In \nJune 2020, the FBI Joint Intelligence Bulletin reported: \nMilitia extremists sometimes call themselves three percenters (III%ers) \nbased on the myth that only three percent of American colonists took up \narms against the British during the Revolutionary War. Some III%ers \nregard the present-day US Government as analogous to British authorities \nduring the Revolution in terms of infringements on civil liberties. While \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmany independent or multi-state militia groups incorporate III% in their unit \nnames, the term is less indicative of membership in a single overarching \ngroup than it is representative in a common belief in the notion that a small \nforce with a just cause can overturn a tyrannical government if armed and \nprepared. Self-identification as a III%er or use of III% symbols should \nnot independently be considered evidence of militia affiliation or \nillegal activity. (Emphasis added) (GE 4 at 138) \nIn December 2020, the FBI Domestic Terrorism Reference Guide reported that \nsome militia MVEs call themselves III%ers, and added that III%ers: \nRefers to a militia-movement based on the myth that only three percent of \nAmericans fought against the British during the American Revolutionary \nWar. Adherents use the myth to pledge or justify their willingness to use \nforce to resist restrictions on firearms or civil liberties against the present-\nday US Government and other government entities, which are viewed as \nakin to the British during the Revolution. Self-identification as a III%er or \nuse of III% symbols should not independently be considered \nevidence of militia affiliation or illegal activity. (Emphasis added) (Item \nVI) \nSeveral militia-style organizations incorporated have Three Percenters and \nPatriots into their names or logos, including the Michigan United Patriots Three Percent, \nthe California Patriots, and the Texas Three Percenters. The Guardians of Freedom \nhave \u201cIII\u201d in their logo. A number of individuals who identified as members of Three \nPercenter militias were arrested and convicted for crimes related to the breach of the \nU.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. \nQAnon \nIn United States v. Perna, an FBI Special Agent presented the FBI assessment \nof QAnon: \nQAnon is a sprawling, discredited, anti-establishment conspiracy theory \nthat originated from postings on online message boards by an anonymous \nindividual known as \u201cQ.\u201d Q claims to be a high-level government official \nwith a Q clearance and access to classified information. Central to the \nQAnon conspiracy theory is the false belief that the world is run by a cabal \nof Satan-worshipping pedophiles and child-traffickers (allegedly largely \ncomprised of prominent Democratic politicians, so-called \u201cDeep State\u201d \ngovernment employees, journalists, and Hollywood elite) and that \nPresident Trump is secretly working with Q and others to take down the \ncabal. Many QAnon adherents (known as \u201cAnons\u201d) refer to themselves as \n\u201cdigital soldiers\u201d and believe they are engaged in an epic battle between \ngood and evil and darkness and light. Following the November 3, 2020 \nelection, many QAnon adherents began pushing false and discredited \ntheories of massive voter fraud and that the 2020 election had been \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cstolen\u201d from President Trump. Other prominent QAnon adherents \nexhorted the \u201cAnons\u201d to \u201ctrust the plan,\u201d believing that President-Elect \nBiden\u2019s victory is illusory and part of a convoluted plan by Q and others to \nreveal the crimes of the cabal to the world, resulting in President Trump \nsecuring a second term. QAnon believers are waiting for two major \nevents, which they refer to as the \u201cthe Storm\u201d and the \u201cGreat Awakening.\u201d \nThe \u201cStorm\u201d refers to a day of violence which will result in mass arrests, \nmilitary trials, and executions of the members of the cabal. According to \nQAnon lore, \u201cthe Storm\u201d will be followed by the \u201cGreat Awakening,\u201d which \ngenerally refers to the belief that the truth of the central tenets of QAnon \nwill be revealed to the world.  \nIn May 2019, the FBI assessed that anti-government, identity based, and fringe \npolitical conspiracy theories, such as QAnon, very likely motivate some domestic \nextremists, wholly or in part, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity. The FBI \nfurther assesses in some cases these conspiracy theories very likely encourage the \ntargeting of specific people, places, and organizations, thereby increasing the likelihood \nof violence against these targets. \nOne key assumption driving these assessments is that certain conspiracy theory \nnarratives tacitly support or legitimize violent action. The FBI also assumes that some, \nbut not all, individuals or domestic extremists who hold such beliefs will act on them. \nIn June 2022, a joint special analysis assessed that adherence to elements of the \ncontinuously evolving QAnon conspiracy theory\u2014some of which are bolstered by the \nresonance of election fraud narratives\u2014will contribute to the radicalization and \nmobilization to violence of a small number of DVEs, posing a threat to individuals and \ninstitutions that supporters of the conspiracy theory have prominently denounced. Some \nself-identifying QAnon adherents participated in the breach of the U.S. Capitol on \nJanuary 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He stated that \nhe became aware of the III symbol because it was reported that an NFL player had the \nsymbol as a tattoo.1 (GE 3, 4 at 38-39) \nThe military criminal investigation division did a criminal and insider-threat \nanalysis and determined that Applicant was not suspected of committing a criminal \noffense or being an insider threat. The military criminal investigation division did not \nopen an investigation, with the following rationale in an email dated January 15, 2021: \n1. Social media was identified with no derogatory information noted. \n2. The FBI has not designated the 3%ers or QAnon as a terrorist \norganization. Neither of them are organized groups. \n3. The 3%er sticker alone is not an indicator of militia affiliation (see \nattached [FBI Joint Information Bulletin identified in above Evidence \nsection] and below for more details.  \n4. While an internet search for three percenters (III%) and QAnon will yield \nseveral sites declaring them anti-government, militia linked, or conspiracy \ntheorists; as with any group there are those who take matters to the \nextreme and those who are more conservative in their voice. Displaying a \nsticker in support of either group does not make an individual a threat. \n5. At this time, [Applicant] is not suspected of committing a criminal \noffense or insider threat. (GE 4 at 133) \nAn administrative investigation was ordered and completed by a U.S. military \nfield grade officer. The investigation disclosed that the vehicle belonged to Applicant. \nThe Three Percenter sticker has III inside a circle of stars. The QAnon sticker is a \nstylized Q with a skull inside. Applicant bought the III sticker on eBay for $20 and placed \nit on his vehicle in about June 2020. He bought the QAnon sticker on eBay for $10 and \nplaced it on his vehicle in about January 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline A, Allegiance to the United States \nThe security concern for allegiance to the United States is set out in AG \u00b6 3: \nThe willingness to safeguard classified or sensitive information is in doubt \nif there is any reason to suspect an individual\u2019s allegiance to the United \nStates. There is no positive test for allegiance, but there are negative \nindicators. These include participation in or support for acts against the \nUnited States or placing the welfare or interests of another country above \nthose of the United States. Finally, the failure to adhere to the laws of the \nUnited States may be relevant if the violation of law is harmful to stated \nU.S. interests. An individual who engages in acts against the United States \nor provides support or encouragement to those who do has already \ndemonstrated willingness to compromise national security. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 4. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) involvement in, support of, training to commit, or advocacy of any act \nof sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition against the United \nStates; \n(b) association or sympathy with persons who are attempting to commit, or \nwho are committing, any of the above acts; and \n(c) association or sympathy with persons or organizations that advocate, \nthreaten, or use force or violence, or use any other illegal or \nunconstitutional means, in an effort to: \n(1) overthrow or influence the U.S. Government or any state or \nlocal government; \n(2) prevent Federal, state, or local government personnel from \nperforming their official duties; \n(3) gain retribution for perceived wrongs caused by the Federal, \nstate, or local government; and \n(4) prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution \nor laws of the United States or of any state. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is \u201cassociated with and sympathetic to the \nideologies of the Three Percenters, a domestic militia that advocates resistance to \ncertain U.S. federal policies. Supporters of the Three Percenters were present at the \ninsurrection that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\u201d \nThe first issue is whether the \u201cThree Percenters\u201d is a domestic militia. Clearly \nsome militia violent extremists call themselves Three Percenters, and some militias \nhave added that to their name. It is not an entity, such as the Ku Klux Klan or the \nAmerican Nazi Party, where to identify oneself as part of the organization is to identify \noneself as an extremist. As the FBI reported: \u201cWhile many independent or multi-state \nmilitia groups incorporate III% in their unit names, the term is less indicative of \nmembership in a single overarching group than it is representative in a common belief in \nthe notion that a small force with a just cause can overturn a tyrannical government if \narmed and prepared.\u201d \nWhile the Three Percenters math is wrong, their \u201ccommon belief in the notion that \na small force with a just cause can overturn a tyrannical government if armed and \nprepared\u201d is not in and of itself problematic. That belief worked in 1776. This planet is \nfull of countries with tyrannical governments. The world would be a better place if more \nof those countries\u2019 citizens were able to overthrow their dictators. The problem in this \ncountry is not in the common belief; it is when the followers of that belief also believe \nthe U.S. Government is \u201ca tyrannical government\u201d that needs to be overthrown. \nApplicant credibly denied that he is a Three Percenter, that he has ever been a \nmember of a militia or any similar group, or that he supports or is sympathetic to any \nextremist group. He was horrified by the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He \ntestified that he did not understand the full meaning of the III sticker, and that he came \nacross it on eBay. \nBased on the information available at the time of the 2021 investigation, the \nmilitary criminal investigation division did a criminal and insider-threat analysis and \ndetermined that Applicant did not commit a crime and was not an insider threat, with the \nfollowing in an email dated January 15, 2021: \nThe FBI has not designated the 3%ers or QAnon as a terrorist \norganization. Neither of them are organized groups. \nThe 3%er sticker alone is not an indicator of militia affiliation (see attached \n[FBI Joint Information Bulletin identified in above Evidence section] and \nbelow for more details.  \nWhile an internet search for three percenters (III%) and QAnon will yield\nseveral sites declaring them anti-government, militia linked, or conspiracy\ntheorists; as with any group there are those who take matters to the\n \n \n \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextreme and those who are more conservative in their voice. Displaying a \nsticker in support of either group does not make an individual a threat. \nApplicant had no connection to Three Percenters beyond the sticker. An \nexamination of his government computer and search history revealed numerous \nsearches and websites connected to QAnon, but nothing associated with Three \nPercenters, III%ers, or Threepers. No co-worker ever recalled Applicant making any \nreference to Three Percenters. Some militias have added Three Percent to their name. \nSome militias have also added words like \u201cPatriot\u201d to their names. That does not mean \nthat someone who identifies as a patriot also identifies with the militias. With the power \nof hindsight and the passage of about four years, we now see the connections some \nThree Percenters have to militia groups. It does not seem fair to hold Applicant to \nknowledge that even the military criminal investigation division did not have at the time. I \nam not convinced that Applicant drew the connection when he placed the III sticker on \nhis vehicle. Nor am I convinced he associated with or sympathized with a Three \nPercenter domestic militia. There are no disqualifying conditions applicable to SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, and it is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is \u201cassociated with and sympathetic to the \nideologies of QAnon, a political conspiracy theory that had supporters present at the \ninsurrection that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\u201d \nTo many people, QAnon is a joke that cannot be taken seriously. That may be \ntrue, but QAnon is also dangerous. The FBI assessed that fringe political conspiracy \ntheories, such as QAnon, very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in \npart, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity. Certain conspiracy theory \nnarratives tacitly support or legitimize violent action. The FBI also assumes that some, \nbut not all, individuals who hold such beliefs will act on them. Some self-identifying \nQAnon adherents participated in the breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. \nI do not believe that Applicant ever intended to commit or support any violent act \nagainst the U.S. Government, but his connections to QAnon brought him into \nassociation with those who did. AG \u00b6\u00b6 4.b and 4.c are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate allegiance to the United States security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 5. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual was unaware of the unlawful aims of the individual or \norganization and severed ties upon learning of these; \n(c) involvement in the above activities occurred for only a short period of \ntime and was attributable to curiosity or academic interest; and \n(d) the involvement or association with such activities occurred under such \nunusual circumstances, or so much time has elapsed, that it is unlikely to \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or allegiance. \nApplicant thought QAnon was \u201cbasically an online repository of information. \nThere\u2019s no ideology. A person can go in and access it and do their own research on it.\u201d \nHe stated that it is \u201ckind of like a big puzzle,\u201d and \u201ckind of like the Da Vinci Code.\u201d He did \nnot agree with everything on QAnon. He felt the QAnon message he sent was anti-\nracist, and promoted unification, not division. He now feels that he was misinformed. He \ndoes not intend to have any further connection in any way to QAnon. \nAny person who supports violent acts against the U.S. Government should not \nhold a security clearance. As indicated above, I do not believe Applicant is one of those \nindividuals. Applicant\u2019s interest in QAnon was limited and did not involve any deeper \nnefarious motives. It does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \nallegiance. Guideline A security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nOn numerous occasions, Applicant accessed QAnon-affiliated websites and \nsocial media using his government computer system. On June 29, 2020, and June 30, \n2020, he sent emails through his government email account to three other federal \nemployees. Attached to the emails were documents that contained QAnon-associated \nrhetoric. \nThe Government did not produce any specific rules or regulation that Applicant \nviolated. At a minimum, DoD Regulation 5500.07-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (August 30, \n1993), as amended (JER), is applicable.

(JER, subsection 2-301.a.(2)(d)) \nApplicant used his government computer and email for an unauthorized purpose \nthat does not fit within any of the exceptions. AG \u00b6 40(e) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nQAnon can be many things to many people, and it is not always obviously \nsubversive. The above discussion under Guideline A applies equally here. I believe \nApplicant made mistakes, but I am convinced that he has learned from the experience. \nThe above behavior happened under unique circumstances; it is unlikely to recur; and it \ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The \nabove mitigating conditions are applicable. Use of information technology security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b cross-alleges the allegations under Guideline A and M. With slight \nvariations, SOR \u00b6 3.a essentially alleges the same conduct, but adds that Applicant was \nbarred from all military installations in Country A for ten years and terminated from his \nemployment. The debarment and termination do not constitute conduct. They are the \nresults of conduct. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Because there are slight \nvariations in the alleged conduct in the two allegations, I am not going to resolve one in \nApplicant\u2019s favor before they are analyzed. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur; and \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are mitigated under the same rationale \ndiscussed above under Guidelines A and M. Applicant\u2019s conduct happened under \nunique circumstances that are unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The above mitigating conditions are \napplicable. Because all of the personal conduct security concerns are mitigated, it is \nunnecessary to resolve one of the duplicate allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines A, E, and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nApplicant is either a na\u00efve patriot who bought III and QAnon stickers and was \nsomewhat enthralled by QAnon without fully understanding their significance and the \nunderlying dangers associated with those entities, or he is a supporter of domestic \nterrorism who was able to keep that hidden from all who knew him best. For all the \nreasons discussed above, I am convinced he is the former. I believe his co-worker \ncorrectly summarized the situation in his statement for the investigation: \u201c[Applicant] has \nnever represented himself as anything other than being patriotic. I think he got himself \ncaught up in something he didn\u2019t know what he was getting into.\u201d \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines A, E, and M. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline A: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He \nsigned the contract to enlist in the military in about August 2008, but he did not go to \nboot camp until April 2009.

(Tr. at 24-25, 55, 62-64) \nApplicant used marijuana on about ten occasions from May 2016 through March \n2020. He smoked it, vaped it, or ate it, always with his wife. He used cocaine on two \noccasions in May 2019. He and his wife used it with his neighbor who provided the \ncocaine. They were drinking on both occasions. Applicant held a security clearance \nduring the entire period of his drug use from 2016 through 2020. From about October \n2017 to January 2019, he had access to classified information. After that, he held a \nsecurity clearance but did not have access to classified information. (Tr. at 20, 26-41, \n57-59; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nApplicant self-reported his marijuana use to his security officer after he was hired \nby his current employer in June 2019. He wrote that he last used marijuana in \nSeptember 2018, with the following comment: \u201cIt was after that instance that 10 years of \nguilt and secrets were bearing down on me. I put it down and I have not touched \nmarijuana or have any inclination to touch marijuana again.\u201d (Tr. at 16, 44-49, 56; GE 3) \nHe added: \nI was hired to work at [Employer] in June 2019. I knew that I would have to \ndeclare that I have never, nor will I ever, use drugs prior to being allowed \ninto classified spaces. After 10 years of withholding the truth and keeping \nthis secret, I could not bear to hold it any longer.

(GE 3) \nApplicant did not report his cocaine use that occurred just the month before his \nstatement. He wrote in the statement that high school \u201cwas the last time [he] used \ncocaine.\u201d He used marijuana about two to three times after he submitted the statement \nto his security officer. He fully reported his illegal drug use on the SF 86 he submitted in \nJuly 2021 and during his background interview in October 2021. He initially testified that \nhe had never used cocaine before the two recent times. He then admitted that he used \ncocaine in high school. (Tr. at 37-38, 49-52; GE 1-3) \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since he last smoked marijuana in \nMarch 2020. His wife also no longer uses illegal drugs. The friend he smoked marijuana \nwith stopped using marijuana, and the neighbor he used cocaine with moved away. \nApplicant used to drink regularly. In about November 2022, he and his wife decided to \nsignificantly cut down on their drinking and concentrate on their children and other \nactivities. He estimates that he has had a total of fewer than ten drinks since then. He is \ncommitted to remaining drug free. He realizes that he made poor decisions when he \nused illegal drugs. He is willing to accept the consequences of his conduct.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana on about ten occasions from about 2016 through \nMarch 2020 and cocaine twice in May 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nApplicant held a security clearance and was in a sensitive position during all the \nabove drug use, but only his marijuana use between about October 2017 and January \n2019 occurred while he was granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case \nNo. 22-01661 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2023). AG \u00b6 25(g) is applicable to his marijuana \nuse between about October 2017 and January 2019. AG \u00b6 25(g) is not applicable to his \ncocaine use and his marijuana use while he did not have access to classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) for a \ndiscussion on the distinction between holding a security clearance and having access to \nclassified information. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana while granted access to classified information and \ncocaine while holding a security clearance.

He was less than completely frank during his June 2019 statement to his \nsecurity officer. He wrote that his cocaine use in high school was the last time he used \ncocaine, when he had used it twice in the previous month. He then used marijuana two \nto three times after he submitted that statement. Applicant appears to be on the right \ntrack, and if he continues to abstain from illegal drug use, he will once again be a good \ncandidate for a security clearance. At this time, he is not. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his two deployments to Afghanistan. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage \u201cwhile granted access \nto classified information,\u201d which is \nfound For Applicant) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. He has owned his home since 1996. He has been employed \nby his corporate clearance sponsor since February 1986. He currently holds a secret \nclearance, granted in June 2011. He has never been denied a clearance. He has no \nfinancial delinquencies or defaults, other than the failure to file three years of federal tax \nincome tax returns, as alleged below. (Item 2.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020. (Item 1S.) He admitted that allegation with a \ndetailed text explaining why he is tardy filing his tax returns. (Item 1A.) The following is a \nsynopsis in his words of the salient points of his Answer. \nNon filing of returns for 2018, 2019, and 2020 \nI have listed procrastination as the reason . . . More correctly I should have called \nthis, \u201cNot enough time to get it all done\u201d. . . My unfiled taxes are not the greatest priority \nfor the following reasons. I always have greater withholding done from my income so that \nI am guaranteed a sizable refund . . . I do not ever come up short on taxes paid so I do \nnot ever incur a shortage of tax already paid, or interest and penalties. For me, the IRS \nis always a savings account that pays me back my money when I do get around to filing \ntaxes. \nThese are some things that occupy my time and do not allow me to do things I \nwould prefer to be getting done, like taxes, in a timely manner. \nWork schedule at [my employer] demands from me to work 50-60 (and \nsometimes more) hours each week. A lot of work and not enough people are the main \nreason for this. I was not able to take the vacation this year that I wanted to because . . . \nmanagement [could] not let me go because of schedule demands. I finally did get \napproval for one week this year. Because of this I had to forfeit 140 hours of vacation . . . \nand have it paid out to me . . . . \nDeath of two family members, Father-in-Law 2016 and Aunt 2018. I was made \nexecutor of both of their estates . . . trustee of . . . [father-in-law\u2019s] trust.

So it was left to me to get [it] done. My wife has no siblings . . . It takes a lot of time  \nTo do this, especially if you have never done this type of thing before . . . [Y]ou must \nlocate the required documentation which is the biggest use of time.  \nCare of disabled wife. In 1999 my wife suffered from a brain tumor the size of a golf ball. \nShe had three brain surgeries and extensive radiation treatments. She survived this and \nis still alive, despite her doctors saying she would not live past two years. Well, thank \nGod, she is still alive, but at the cost of diminished mental capacity, making her 100% \ndisabled. She used to be a very smart [professional], but now, she is not. She was doing \nreasonably well considering what she went through, but now twenty years later, her \nmental abilities are going further downhill. She has . . . an infection where the bone in her \nskull has died off in a several inches square area. This is because the radiation treatment \nback in 1999 and now the infection defies treatment . . . After seeing several . . . specialists \n. . . , she was referred to [a hospital] for surgery that her doctor here says is going to be \na big deal (his words) and will require a multi-discipline surgery team to cut out the dead, \ninfected bone, and now at a later date, replace it with a titanium plate. She was finally \nscheduled . . . for brain surgery. Every time I take her to the doctor, I must make up the \ntime at my job because schedules here wait for no one . . . I was lucky to receive two \nweeks of FMLA from my employer . . . My wife has now undergone the surgery to cut out \nthe dead infected bone from her head on Feb. 25, 2022. She was on the neurosurgery \nfloor . . . for 7 days. When she returned home, I as her caregiver had to swap out the IV \nbag and change the IV infusion lines that delivered antibiotics into her body via an IV \npump, to stop the infection in her head, every day for six weeks. Except for the two weeks \nof FMLA leave, I had to work and at the same time perform the medical care for my wife \n. . . to fight the infection. \nNow another medical problem for my wife. She is scheduled to undergo surgery for her \ncolon on June 15th  at 6:00 AM because of severe diverticulitis. She will be in the hospital \nfor four days and she may end up with a colostomy . . . The faster I go, the behinder [sic] \nI get.   \nI have 20 acres of property to maintain. [Here, Applicant explained that he alone \nmaintains his property. His two sons have moved away with their families to pursue their \nown careers.] \nI assure you I will file my tax forms and get my tax refunds, for overpayment, as soon as \nI can muster up the time to do so. Not doing my taxes is a time problem and not an ability \nto pay taxes problem. I have paid my taxes. I have just not filed and gotten the refund I \nwill be entitled to when I do get around to filing. (Emphasis in original.) (Item 1A.) \nIn his Personal Subject Interview, Applicant stated: \u201cI usually do several returns in \nbatch mode once I get into the mode of doing taxes and I do not ever come up short on \ntaxes paid, and I do not ever incur a shortage of tax already paid or interest and for me \nthe IRS is always a savings account that pays me back my money when I do get around \nto filing my taxes.\u201d (Item 3.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s IRS Account Transcripts for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 show no \ntax balances owed or refunds due for those years. That is likely, however, because he \nhas not filed returns, which would show income earned and applicable deductions. (Item \n4.)  \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. A2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is the only one applicable in this case: \n(f)  failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns . . .  \nas required. \nThe SOR\u2019s alleged unfiled federal income tax returns are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b619 (f) applies. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating \nconditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . unexpected medical emergency . . .), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  \nApplicant\u2019s challenges began in 1999, when his wife developed a brain tumor that \nwas diagnosed to be fatal within two years. With additional surgeries and radiation \ntreatments over the years, she survived. And she is alive today. The price she and her \nfamily paid was her diminished mental capacity, far from being the smart professional she \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nonce was. That price is still being paid. The latest is that a portion of her skull has died \nbecause of an infection caused by years of radiation treatment. She had serious surgery \nin February 2022 to remove the infected bone from her skull. More surgery will likely be \nneeded. \nThe medical care Applicant\u2019s wife needed from him after that surgery and his own \nwork demands stole time from everyday issues like filing tax returns. He functioned as an \nin-home nurse and prioritized household needs as best he could. Having shepherded his \nwife through her latest brain surgery, he had to face another medical problem with his \nwife. She needed colon surgery in June 2022 and was hospitalized for four days. \nIn addition to handling his wife\u2019s medical problems, Applicant was confronted by \ntwo deaths in the family. His father-in-law died in 2016, and an aunt died in 2018. He was \nnamed the executor of their estates and the trustee of his father-in-law\u2019s trust. Having \nnever served in those capacities before, Applicant expended a great deal of time with \nthese tasks, losing time that he could have spent on his own household chores like \npreparing tax returns. He summed it up in his Answer: \u201cNot enough time to get it all done.\u201d \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed \nwith her brain tumor in 1999, a diagnosis and consequences that she and Applicant have \nlived with ever since. Sadly, the consequences of that diagnosis are likely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s perseverance over the years is commendable. It seems, however, that over \nthose years, he has a developed a practice of doing his tax returns late and in \u201cbatches\u201d \nonce he gets into \u201cthe mode of doing taxes.\u201d That practice of doing his taxes when he \ngets around to them is what is also likely to recur. And that practice raises security \nconcerns. I find that AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). There is no question that \nApplicant confronted conditions \u201clargely beyond his control.\u201d The next inquiry is whether \nhe acted \u201cresponsibly\u201d in light of those conditions. For the reasons stated under the AG \u00b6 \n20(a) discussion, his practice of doing his tax returns when he gets into the \u201cmode\u201d of \ndoing taxes is not responsible conduct under his admittedly adverse circumstances. I find \nthat AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2018, 2019, and 2020. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.

After several surgeries and continuous \ntreatment, she awoke from her coma and appeared to be recovering. Just when she \nshe appeared to be recovering, she developed a lung infection and died in May 2017. \nFrom the time of her brain aneurism in 2014 until she passed away from a lung infection \nin 2017, she was continuously in a hospital or care facility. (Item 1) \nIn August 2018, a few months after Applicant\u2019s mother passed away, his father \nwas diagnosed with prostate cancer. Fifteen months later, his father died in November \n2019. Throughout this process Applicant\u2019s mother and father accrued numerous and \nsubstantial medical bills and funeral expenses. Although Medicare paid their portion of \nthe bills, Applicant and his siblings found themselves responsible for the balance. Since \nApplicant was not married, his married siblings prevailed upon him to pay the majority of \nthese bills. (Item 1) \nIn the summer of 2019, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend was laid off from her job and shortly \nthereafter was diagnosed with breast cancer. In addition to her breast cancer diagnosis, \nshe developed a heart condition that required medical treatment. Since his girlfriend \nwas no longer employed, she did not have health care insurance and Applicant paid for \nher medical bills. (Item 1) \nTo pay for these unplanned medical and funeral expenses, Applicant drew credit \ncard cash advances and took out a personal bank loan to offset his credit card debts. \nHe made the decision to pay off his credit card balances and personal loan rather than \npaying his taxes because his credit cards had higher balances when compared to the \ntaxes he owed. He has since paid off all of his credit card debt and personal loan as \nwell as his automobile loan. (Item 1) \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM noted that Applicant filed his tax returns for the tax \nyears at issue; however, he emphasized that his returns were not timely filed. \nDepartment Counsel also said that Applicant did not submit any evidence that he is on a \npayment plan with the IRS. A review of the FORM indicates that Applicant e-filed his \n2016 Federal and state tax return on June 19, 2017, that he mailed his 2017 and 2018 \nFederal and state tax returns on February 1, 2022, and that he e-filed his 2019 and \n2020 Federal and state tax returns in January 2022. (Item 1) \nApplicant stated in his Response to Interrogatories that he is working with an IRS \napproved collection agency (CA) and that as soon as they received updates from the \nIRS regarding his 2017 and 2018 income tax returns, they would set up a payment plan \nfor him. Although Applicant was unable to set up a payment plan with the CA at the time \nhe submitted his FORM response, he did provide evidence that he made direct \npayments to the IRS as follows: (1) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on December 3, 2021 \nfor tax year 2016; (2) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on June 6, 2022 for tax year 2016; \nand (3) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on June 6, 2022 for tax year 2019.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility \nfor proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nThe potentially applicable financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority, to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant described circumstances beyond his control, which adversely affected \nhis finances. In summary, over a four-year period Applicant lost both of his parents to \nprolonged illnesses. As the only unmarried sibling, he took on the lion\u2019s share of the \nuncovered medical expenses as well as the funeral expenses for his parents. Shortly \nafter Applicant\u2019s parents passed away, his girlfriend was laid off from her job and was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. As she did not have health care insurance, Applicant \nagreed to pay for her medical expenses. By any objective standard, the loss of both \nparents after lengthy illnesses in a four-year period followed by one\u2019s significant other \nbeing diagnosed with breast cancer is not only beyond one\u2019s control but is also \ntraumatic. Faced with significant debt, Applicant fell behind not only on his credit card \nand personal loan debt but neglected to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes. \nHe made the decision to first address his credit card and personal loan debt. In \nretrospect, Applicant recognizes that this choice was not the most prudent one. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there\nis more than one delinquent debt, and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \n \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if [an applicant\u2019s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or \nin part, due to circumstances outside his control, the [administrative judge] could still \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsider whether [the applicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. \n99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, \n1999)). A component is whether he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Although Applicant clearly \nexperienced circumstances beyond his control with the passing of his parents and \ncancer diagnosis of his girlfriend, he neglected his responsibility to remain current on his \nincome taxes. However, since he regained his emotional and financial bearings, he has \nproceeded with all due diligence to address his tax issues. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant made a number of direct payments to the IRS before establishing a \npayment plan with an IRS approved collection agency to pay his delinquent taxes. His \npayment plan with the CA is measured, paid by direct debit, shows a good-faith effort, \nand demonstrates his commitment to regaining financial responsibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and \n20(b) partially apply and AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) fully apply. Security concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I have weighed \nthe evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old system administrator employed by a defense contractor \nsince April 2016. He worked in information technology (IT) for two other companies from \nFebruary 2012 to April 2016, and as a logistics technician from May 2011 to January \n2012. Prior to May 2012, he worked as a seasonal laborer. He was unemployed from \nJanuary 2012 to February 2012, and from October 2009 to May 2010. He held a security \nclearance in 2013. (GE 1; Tr. 11, 29-33) \nApplicant attended a technical institute from December 2009 to September 2011 \nand earned an associate degree. He married in July 2006 and has four children, ages 21, \n16, 14, and 12. (GE 1; AE A-B; Tr. 32-34, 39) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to the cost of maintaining a family of six, \nhis unemployment and underemployment, his wife\u2019s unemployment, health, and \nunderemployment. (Answer; GE 1 at 43-55; Tr. 29-30, 39-43, 48, 51-52, 61-62) He \nprioritized debts and focused on paying his mortgage, car loan, and utilities. (Tr. 39-40) \nThe evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b: student loans placed for collection of $42,262. Applicant \nadmitted each allegation explaining that the student loans were in forbearance under \nCOVID-19 relief measures. (Answer; Tr. 25) He disclosed the delinquent loans in his June \n2020 SCA. (GE 1 at 44-45, 54) He testified that he incurred the loans while attending a \ntechnical school and made required payments until about 2012. After he fell behind on \npayments due to underemployment, his forbearance request was granted. He learned \nthat his student loans might be forgiven in about 2009 and joined a class action lawsuit \nagainst the school in 2015. (Tr. 34-38; AE B) He adopted a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach \nregarding payments on the loans because of the lawsuit, pending action by the \nDepartment of Education, and because his income was not sufficient to pay his student \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nloans and household bills.

(Tr. 38, 41) \nIn August 2022, the Department of Education announced that it would discharge \nstudent loans received to attend the school. (GE 7) Applicant submitted evidence that his \nstudent loans were discharged in November 2022, because of misconduct and \nmisrepresentations by the school. (AE A; Tr. 34-41, 67-68) These debts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: home improvement loan charged off for $5,050. Applicant denied \nthe allegation in his Answer, noting that he had agreed to a payment plan and had made \npayments that reduced the balance to $4,147. He submitted evidence of payments \ntotaling about $1,688 from October 2021 to March 2022. (Answer) He testified that he \nentered a payment plan in 2020 or 2021, that he made regular payments that reduced \nthe balance to about $2,589, and that he would continue making payments until the debt \nwas paid. (Tr. 41-44, 68-69) He submitted evidence of additional payments totaling $900 \nfrom January 2023 to June 2023. (AE C) Credit reports show the loan was charged off \nfor $7,485, that the balance was $5,050 in January 2022, and that as of June 23, 2023, \nthe balance was $2,589. (GE 3 at 2, GE 2 at 4) This debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: loan charged off for $2,237. Applicant denied the allegation, \nsubmitted evidence that he had agreed to a payment plan, and noted that his payments \nhad reduced the balance to $1,637. (Answer) He reported the debt and payment plan in \nhis June 2020 SCA. (GE 1 at 52-53) He testified that he had been making monthly \npayments of $100 since 2019, that he had reduced the balance to $437, and would \ncontinue making payments until the debt was paid. (Tr. 21, 45-46) He submitted evidence \nof payments totaling $1,465 from January to June 2023. (AE C) Credit reports show the \nloan was charged off for $3,596, that the balance was $2,237 in January 2022, and that \nas of June 23, 2023, the balance was $437. (GE 3 at 3, GE 2 at 8) This debt is being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit card placed for collection of $453. Applicant admitted the \nallegation in his Answer, noting that he was working with the creditor to settle the \nremaining balance. He reported the debt in his June 2020 SCA. (GE 1 at 50-51) He \ntestified that the debt remained outstanding, that he intended to pay it off, and that the \ncreditor rejected his February 2023 settlement offer. (Tr. 46-47) Credit reports reflect the \naccount was in collection for $454 in July 2020 and for $453 in January 2022. (GE 4 at \n14, GE 3 at 3) This debt is not resolved. \nIn his June 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed approximately $62,000 of delinquent \ndebt including the debts alleged in the SOR, and delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR \n(Non-SOR) totaling about $8,200. (GE 1 at 43-55) He earned $45,000 to $55,000 \nannually from July 2013 to April 2016, and his gross annual salary increased from $55,000 \nin 2016 to $108,000 in 2023. (Tr. 31-32) \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated June 23, 2023, reflects two delinquent Non-SOR \ndebts including a past-due mortgage, and a telecommunications account in collection for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$926. (GE 2 at 4-5, 7-8) He submitted evidence that mortgage payments he had timely \nsubmitted in June 2023 totaling $2,994 were not reflected in his June 2023 credit report. \n(GE 2 at 5; AE F) He testified that the telecommunications debt resulted from a change \nin providers, that his previous provider refused to accept phones in return, and that he \nintended to settle the debt. (Tr. 49) He provided a budget but has not received financial \ncounseling. (AE G; Tr. 71) \nI found Applicant's responses and demeanor at the hearing to be credible and \nconsistent with his SCA, Answer and someone who was reliably telling the truth. After \nreviewing the entire record, I find that his hearing testimony is corroborated by \ndocumentary evidence submitted by the government and his own exhibits. He credibly \nresponded to all questions and was keenly aware of the significance of resolving his debts \nand establishing his financial responsibility. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nThose debts are resolved, occurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely, and \ndo not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s periods of \nunemployment and underemployment were largely beyond their control. One component \nof acting responsibly is maintenance of contact with creditors. Although he has acted \nresponsibly by prioritizing and paying some of his delinquent debts, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established because Applicant has not received financial \ncounselling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. Applicant \nnegotiated payment agreements for these debts before the SOR was issued, made \npayments in accordance with those agreements, and has substantially reduced the \nbalances due. Although the $453 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is unresolved, Applicant plans \nto resolve it in the near future. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual \nmake payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR \nfirst, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only \nestablish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement \nthe plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record including \nApplicant\u2019s education and work history. I also considered that his financial problems were \ncaused, in part, by circumstances beyond his control including unemployment, \nunderemployment, health issues, and responsibilities related to support of a large family. \nApplicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He has a logical and \nappropriate plan for resolving the remaining SOR debts, and there are clear indications \nthat his financial problems are being resolved and are under control. His income has \nsignificantly increased, and he understands the security implications of delinquent debt. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not held to a standard of perfection in \nhis debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that \n[he] act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017). Applicant understands what he needs to do to maintain his financial responsibility. \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole supports \na conclusion that the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations, \nare mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEric C.

He stated that he has learned from \nthe experience, and all future returns will be filed on time. He also asserted that he \nwould continue with the installment plan until his back taxes are paid. (Tr.at 64, 73-75, \n79; AE S) \nApplicant called two witnesses, and he submitted documents and letters attesting \nto his excellent job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his \njudgment, trustworthiness, professionalism, loyalty, honesty, leadership, dependability, \ndedication, reliability, and integrity. He is recommended for a security clearance. (Tr. at \n15-26; AE K-O, V) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n1 The SOR did not allege that Applicant owed taxes for 2021. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR \ncannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions and in the whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal \nincome tax returns when they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable to those tax years. \nApplicant\u2019s request for an extension to file his 2020 federal income tax return was \ngranted to October 15, 2021. The IRS received the 2020 return on October 20, 2021. \nFor security clearance purposes, that is not late. The language in SOR \u00b6 1.a referring to \ntax year 2020 is concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant did not pay federal income taxes when they were due for tax years \n2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, resulting in a tax debt in June 2022 of \nabout $196,000. AG \u00b6 19(f) is also applicable based on the unpaid taxes. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues started in about 2013 when he was working overseas. His \nsecond wife was a foreign national, and he supported her and her family throughout the \nimmigration process. He had health issues, his mother passed away, and he was laid \noff a job in 2013. He withdrew about $30,000 from his 401(k) retirement account for his \nmother-in-law\u2019s surgery and about another $80,000 for living expenses. He did not \nproperly account for the tax consequences. He was overwhelmed and did not file his tax \nreturns. \nApplicant is credited with filing all of the past-due returns. He has an installment \nagreement, and since September 2022, he has paid a total of $36,400, reducing the \ntotal owed to $164,786. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nIn 2017, Applicant paid the IRS about $2,050, which went toward his 2012 taxes. \nIn 2018, he paid about $3,423, which went toward his 2012 and 2015 taxes. In 2019, he \npaid about $2,872, which went toward his 2015 and 2016 taxes. That means from 2017 \nthrough 2019, he paid about $8,345 toward his 2012, 2015, and 2016 taxes. The 2012 \nand 2015 tax years are paid. Those numbers sound good, but while he was making \nthose payments, his tax liability was increasing because he was not paying all of the \ntaxes due for those years. Even without accounting for penalties and interest, he \nunderpaid his 2017 taxes by $8,910; his 2018 taxes by $2,354; and his 2019 taxes by \n$20,604, for a total of about $31,868. \nApplicant did not make any payments toward his back taxes from November \n2019 through August 2022. After being interviewed for his background investigation in \nDecember 2019, he did not file his 2019 federal income tax return until March 2021, and \nhe did not pay his 2019, 2020, and 2021 taxes when they were due. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes \non time continues to raise doubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns and paid taxes \nis insufficient to overcome the years of Applicant shirking his responsibility to file his tax \nreturns and pay his taxes when they were due. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

He was unemployed from December 2019 until he \nwas interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in July \n2021.

(Items 3, 7) He seeks a clearance in conjunction with his current employment. \nHe has previous clearance history as a result of his military service, discussed below. \n(Item 7) \nApplicant was awarded an associate degree in June 1994 and was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in August 1996. (Items 3, 7) Applicant was married from April 1996 to \nJuly 2008. That marriage ended by divorce. He has two adult children, ages 34 and 25. \nApplicant indicated that he has been residing with a cohabitant since November 2015. \n(Items 3, 7) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army and Army National Guard (ANG) as both an \nenlisted soldier and officer from 1983 until his retirement in 2015. Because of his service \non active duty, Applicant became eligible for an early ANG retirement in June 2019 and \nreceives approximately $4,093 per month. (Items 7, 10) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s eight delinquent SOR debts, totaling approximately $68,644, are \nestablished by his June 4, 2021 SF-86; his February 4, 2020 and July 13, 2021 OPM \ninterviews; his October 5, 2021 DOHA Interrogatory responses; his July 2, 2021, March \n9, 2022, and September 19, 2022 credit reports; his child support/divorce records; and \nhis undated SOR Answer. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h; Items 1-10) In his SOR Answer, \nApplicant admitted each allegation. \nAlthough not his largest debt, Applicant\u2019s $10,000 child support arrearage in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h presents as the most troubling. In February 2013, Applicant\u2019s former spouse\nobtained a $7,651 child support judgment of delinquency against him.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability \nof mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \n\u00b6\u00b6eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nmaintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that \narticulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApart from AG \u00b6 20(b), none of the mitigating conditions apply. However, full \ncredit under that mitigating condition is not warranted given the fact that Applicant failed \nto act responsibly and neglected to remain in contact with his creditors during his \nperiods of unemployment. The evidence does not support application of any of the other \npotential mitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing, and he \nhas not established that his debts are being resolved or are under control. Nor did he \ndocument that any of the SOR debts are not his responsibility. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the context of the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nmajority of his adult life, is receiving military retirement pay, and is presumed to be a \nmature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information suggesting that his \nlong-standing financial problems are being addressed, doubts remain about his \nsuitability for access to classified information. Protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications. Accordingly, those doubts must be resolved \nagainst Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he did not \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. He failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \nregarding his past efforts to address his outstanding delinquent debt. Because he failed \nto provide such information and relied on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to fully \nestablish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. 30, 33-34; AE L) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports in the record, the Government \nestablished that Applicant has 13 delinquent accounts totaling about $35,000. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.    \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017); See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies due to unemployment, loss of \nincome from his roommate, and underemployment. Notwithstanding these unforeseen \nevents that impacted his finances, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted responsibly \nin dealing with his financial issues under the circumstances. \nIt is well-established that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration \nin evaluating whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems. To receive full credit under Mitigating Condition 20(d), an \napplicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(d).

See, e.g., ISCR Case 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nApplicant testified that he had paid other debts not alleged in the SOR, and in \n2020, he paid $5,000 towards the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He also put money into his \nsavings, and after receipt of the May 2022 SOR, he depleted his savings account to pay \noff several of the delinquent accounts. He denied that he only took action to resolve his \ndebts after he was placed on notice that his security clearance was in jeopardy. He has \nbeen communicating with his creditors and working diligently to resolve his financial \ndelinquencies well before the SOR was issued. He provided documentation to show he \nhas made seven consecutive $1,000 monthly payments to his largest SOR creditor for a \nheating system installed in his home. I find he has established a meaningful financial track \nrecord of payments to this creditor. It is his intention to continue working with his creditors \nuntil all of his delinquent accounts are paid. \nApplicant has fully resolved several delinquent SOR accounts and has greatly \nreduced his overall indebtedness. There is sufficient evidence that his financial problems \nare being resolved and are under control. Overall, I find that Applicant has demonstrated \nthat he acted responsibly to address his financial delinquencies. He provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues developed due to circumstances beyond his control. \nHe has acted responsibly to address and resolve his financial delinquencies. His efforts \nreflect good judgment and reliability, and he has greatly reduced his overall indebtedness. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nDespite his financial issues, his employer has seen his work ethic over the years and \nconsiders him to be an exemplary employee. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m:  \nFOR Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a \nsecurity clearance.

The elections were observed by the European Union and domestic \ncivil society organizations and monitored by the United Nations Assistance Mission or \nIraq. (id.) The 2021 elections were scheduled because of the widespread protests that \nbegan in October 2019 and led to the resignation of former prime minister Adil Abd al-\nMahdi in December 2019. Parliament, in turn, confirmed Prime Minister Mustafa al-\nKadhimi in May 2020. \nIn preparation for the 2021 national elections, Iraq adopted a new electoral law \nbased on individual candidacy and local districts. The 2021 election law was designed \nto create new political opportunities for independents and members and protest \nmovement that brought down the government formed after the 2018 election. See Iraq \nand U.S. Policy, (Congressional Research Service (May 2022). Whether the election \nresults and formation talks will reduce the formal influence of Iran-aligned groups who \nseek to revise or rescind Iraq\u2019s invitation to U.S. military advisors to remain in Iraq is \nunclear. \nFor historical perspective, in 2003, a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and \nsucceeded in removing Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and \npolitical power. See the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. \n2018); Background Note, Iraq, at 3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008). After two years of \noperations under a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in \nMarch 2006 (with the approval of the U.S. government), following free elections. (id) \nSince March 2006, the government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad \ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocs. See the \nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 8. While elections \nhave been held and concluded, none of the key constituent groups have been able to \nform a government, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security \nthroughout the provinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile \npolitical environment in Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that \ncontinue to underscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence. See Iraq 2021 \nHuman Rights Report at 2-3, U.S. Dept. of State (April 2022) \nPost-COVID-19 protests intensified in May 2021, with demonstrators insisting \nthat the government identify and prosecute suspects in a series of assassinations and \nkidnappings since 2020 of protest lesdars, activists, and a prominent security \nresearcher. The incidents have intensified public scrutiny of Prime Minister Al Kadhimi\u2019s \ncredibility and his government\u2019s ability to act against armed groups operating outside \nstate control.

See the World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra. As a result of \nthe U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered. The \nrebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand since \n2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity. \nProposed oil revenue-sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno\u00ad\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunni, and Kurds) still awaits passage after four years of \nstalled negotiations, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such \nlegislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement of the Record, Worldwide \nThreat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence (Jan. 2019) For the foreseeable future, the national government can be \nexpected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law \nto strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector. \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the KRG to \ncontribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s overall exports (a law that would \nseem to validate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk oil) have never led federal \nauthorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s federal authorities have \nseverely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking \nthe oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq\u2019s federal government \ncan have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq and its oil exports, but for the \nUnited States and other Western interests as well. \n \nTerrorism and human rights issues \nDespite recent developments in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a \nvery dangerous, volatile, and unpredictable country. The U.S. State Department \ncontinues to strongly warn U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq. See Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Iraq, at 3-5; Iraq Travel Advisory, U.S. Department of State (April \n2022) The State Department assessed Iraq as being a critical-threat location for crime \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. interests. See Country Security Report at 2-3, U.S. \nDept of State (Sept. 2021) While crime statistics and crime reporting mechanisms are \nincomplete and inconsistent, the vast majority of individuals under contract with, or \nemployed by, the U.S. Government in Iraq are required to travel with a protective \nsecurity detail, so as to limit potential criminal threats against them.

They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

Neither Applicant nor his wife \nhave any control (either individually or jointly with his siblings) over any property or \nfinancial interests in Iraq. Key to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers and seven sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nTerrorist attacks and human rights abuses have long plagued Iraq. Because Iraq \npresents some heightened security risks for applicants who have family and property \ninterests in the country, Applicant is exposed to civilian and military authorities in the \ncountry who might use improper and/or illegal means to obtain classified information in \nApplicant\u2019s possession or control through his siblings (especially his older brother). \nWhile Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings and daughter are infrequent, they are \nlongstanding.

Feb. 20, 2002) \nTo be sure, the risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if \nthe foreign country has an authoritarian government; the government ignores the rule of \nlaw (including widely accepted civil liberties); a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government; the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency; \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage; or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. With \nrespect to Iraq, the country is certainly not free from risks of potential hostage taking. \nIraq, though, maintains strong bilateral relations with the United States and recognizes \ndemocratic principles of governance. \nTaken together, the personal and financial relationships Applicant has with Iraq, \nand the situations that exist in this country, places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationship with any family member living in Iraq and \npension interest that Applicant has with the country (through his daughter as his \npension assignee) does not pose irreconcilable security risks. Such risks that cannot be \nreconciled or otherwise mitigated could potentially place him in a position of having to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq, or to take actions to protect his property interests (directly or indirectly) in \nIraq. \nFurther, while Applicant\u2019s residual interest in his Iraqi pension is small, the \npotential of a reversionary interest in his pension does present some potential for \nirreconcilable conflicts of interest. For these reasons, the Government urges security \nconcerns over risks that Applicant and his pension interest in Iraq might be subject to \nseizure or revision by civilian or military authorities in Iraq. His pension interest, \naccordingly, poses some risk of revision or confiscation by the government of Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s family ties and residual pension interests, accordingly, warrant some \napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions of the foreign influence guideline DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.\u201d \nPotentially applicable, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation is \u00b6 7(f), \u201dsubstantial business, \nfinancial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign-operated business \nthat could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s reported $900 monthly pension currently \nassigned to his daughter in Iraq is potentially worth over $300,000 in discounted future \nbenefits. His interest, though, is limited to a potential reversion, which is quite small. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nNeither Applicant nor his daughter have any direct control over any potential reversion \nor reversion of Applicant\u2019s assigned pension fund. \nTrue, none of Applicant\u2019s siblings or daughter (save for Applicant\u2019s youngest \nbrother who was kidnapped during the Operation Iraqi Freedom campaign) in Iraq have \nany history to date of being subjected to any coercion or pressure. These historical \nantecedents limit the risk of any potential conflict situation. And, while the absence of \nany past coercive measures taken by Iraqi authorities does not completely absolve \nApplicant from any coercive risks in the future given Iraq\u2019s checkered history of \nterrorism and human rights abuses, the risks of any coercive measures being taken \nagainst his siblings and daughter should be considered minimal in making an overall \nrisk assessment. \nThis is not to discount the significance of the nature of the foreign government \n(Iraq in this case). Iraq\u2019s intelligence-gathering and human rights and the country\u2019s \ngovernment relations with the United States are among the most important \nconsiderations to be considered when assessing risks associated with an applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties and property interests in that country. See ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 \n(May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. March 13, 2017) Iraq to \nits credit has maintained good bilateral relations with the United States. While the recent \nreports of attacks and counterattacks on Iraqi targets raise concerns over the future of \nthe U.S. presence in the country in the wake of Iraq\u2019s being drawn into the still unfolding \nmilitary recriminations from the U.S. drone strikes on Soleimani on Iraqi soil, to date the \nstatus of the United States presence and role in Iraq has not been reversed or changed \nin any manifest way. \nMitigation is available to Applicant under the foreign influence guideline of the \nDirective. Based on his case-specific circumstances, mitigating conditions (MC) \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons \nare located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it \nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe United States\u201d; and 8(b),\u201dthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nThe citizenship and resident status of Applicant\u2019s siblings, mother-in-law, and \ndaughter in Iraq, and the pension benefits assigned to his daughter in Iraq, considered \ntogether, create no more than remote risks of a conflict situation that could place \nApplicant in a position that could force him to choose between his personal interests \nand the security interests of the United States. Given the substantia family ties that \nApplicant and his wife enjoy in the United States, any potential conflicts that Applicant \ncould potentially face with his siblings and daughter in Iraq, promise to be minor and \nreconcilable with Applicant\u2019s long demonstrated loyalty to the United States and \nconsiderable and longstanding family interests in this country. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther mitigating conditions available to Applicant are \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d and 8(f), \u201cthe \nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such \nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, he has demonstrated \ninfrequent contact with his siblings and daughter in Iraq. And, the residual pension \ninterests he potentially retains in his daughter\u2019s pension assignment in Iraq is relatively \nsmall and unlikely to ever materialize in applicant\u2019s lifetime. \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his siblings and daughter living in Iraq are less \nsignificant than his connections to his family members in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \npast support of the U.S. Government as an engineer and linguist for the U.S. State \nDepartment assisting the Iraqi government in Operation Iraqi Freedom are important \nfactors in weighing the merits of mitigating foreign influence-based security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s substantial connections to the United States when considered together with \nhis foreign connections are sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain \nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance takes account of the.citizenship status of Applicant, his spouse, his siblings, \nand his daughter, all of whom are either citizens and residents of Iraq or dual citizens of \nIraq and the United States (as with Applicant and his wife). Applicant is a 62-year-old \nlinguist and engineer by training for a defense contractor with seven siblings and a \ndaughter who are citizens and residents of Iraq. While he has a potential residual \ninterest in his Iraq military pension (currently assigned to his daughter), the interest is at \nmost an inchoate interest unlikely to ever materialize. Applicant maintains infrequent \ncontact with his siblings, mother-in-law and daughter in Iraq and provides no financial \nsupport to any of his family members living in the country. \nBased on the evidence presented, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s relatives \nresiding in Iraq have any ties or connections to Iraq (except for Applicant\u2019s older brother \nand brothers-in-law of several of his sisters with military service in Iraq) Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable service to the United States . as a linguist and engineer during the Operation \nIraqi Freedom campaign t is well noted and a good indicator of his loyalties to the \nUnited States. \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers Iraq that still present some heightened risks despite the \ncountry\u2019s strong bilateral relationships with the United States. Terrorists continue to \nthreaten the interests of the United States in Iraq and can be expected to do so in the \nforeseeable future. Through all of this, Iraq still remains a reliable partner in the war on \n13 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nterror in the Middle East, and can be expected to fully comply with the rule of law as an \nimportant ally of the United States. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

She was bedridden with a high-risk pregnancy, and her employer of 20 \nyears terminated her during the pregnancy. Applicant was also unemployed or \nunderemployed with seasonal jobs for a lengthy period of time.

His repayment \nobligation was deferred for several years before going into collection. He has applied for \ndebt forgiveness under a Federal policy that is presently being addressed in the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. No payments are currently due following the Federal COVID-\nrelated \u201cpause\u201d policy on the repayment of student loans. Applicant understands that if \nthe debt-relief program is determined to be legal, most of his student loan debt will be \nforgiven. Once the litigation is resolved and he knows how much he has to pay, he intends \nto begin making monthly payments. This debt is not delinquent at this time. I take \nadministrative notice of the fact under Federal student loan policy, Applicant\u2019s future \npayments when they must commence will be based upon an income-driven repayment \nplan that takes into consideration Applicant\u2019s income, family size, and ability to repay the \nloan at affordable monthly rates. See www.Studentaid.gov. (Tr. at 34-38; AE F.) \n1.c. through 1.p. Medical debts in collection in the amounts ranging from $76 to \n$5,214, totaling approximately $14,600. Applicant has medical insurance for himself and \nhis family through his employer. The payments alleged in the SOR are co-pays on each \nof the bills for medical services for his wife and child. After the hearing, Applicant made a \n$3,000 payment that resolved ten of the medical debts in full. He also entered into a \npayment plan to address the remaining medical debts held by this collection agency. The \nplan requires payments of $194.74 per month for 36 months for a total amount of about \n$7,000. Applicant\u2019s first payment was made in early February 2023. These debts are \nbeing resolved.

All of his references \npraise Applicant\u2019s dedication to his work and his family. They describe him as a \ntrustworthy person with strong religious values and integrity. (AE B through C.). \nApplicant loves his job and asserts that he does it well. The income he earns \nsupports his wife and two children. He is determined to repay his debts that arose in 2018 \nfollowing his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis and treatment, which included surgery, \nchemotherapy, and radiation. His wife\u2019s treatment and medical bills continue up to the \npresent. She is currently in remission, but she gets tested every three months. She still \nsees the same doctors that make up part of the medical bills listed in the SOR. She was \nunable to work for a lengthy period and given her present condition is able to only work \nparttime as a caregiver. \nThey also had medical bills arising from complications in one of his children\u2019s \nmedical condition. The child was born prematurely with medical problems. As a teenager, \nthe child continues to have issues with depression and anxiety, which require ongoing \ntreatment. For the last six or seven years, the child has also been seeing the same doctors \nthat are owed money. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that the doctors are willing to work with \nthem on a payment plan for the past-due accounts. She is current on the co-pays owed \nto the family\u2019s doctors. Applicant asserted that he is a man of his word and he intends to \nfulfill his promises and address all of his debts.

(Tr. at 46-50, 61.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed approximately $47,000 for 27 \nalleged delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and the credit reports in \nthe record establish the existence of these debts and the application of the above \npotentially disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his financial history. \nThe guideline includes the following three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe record shows that Applicant has faced unusual circumstances unlikely to recur \nthat arose for reasons largely beyond his control. He went through a bankruptcy in 2008 \ndue to the loss of his employment and his wife\u2019s employer of 20 years terminating her \ndue to her disability while experiencing a high-risk pregnancy. At the same time, Applicant \nwas unemployed or underemployed, and the couple was unable to maintain their family \nhome and pay their bills. Ten years later, Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed with cancer and \nno longer able to work. Applicant was employed at this time, but as the sole income \nprovider for the family, he was unable to pay all of his wife\u2019s numerous medical bills, repay \nhis student loans, and provide housing and the needs of his family of four. In addition, \none of Applicant\u2019s children, who was born prematurely in 2009, has experienced ongoing \nmedical issues, and Applicant has incurred additional and ongoing medical expenses for \nthe child\u2019s care since birth. \nApplicant has acted responsibly when faced with the potential loss of his \nemployment and medical insurance for his family. He has borrowed money from his 401K \naccount that he had hoped to protect for his retirement, and he used a portion of those \nfunds to pay several of his debts. Significantly, he made a lump-sum payment of $3,000 \non a number of his delinquent medical accounts and has entered into a payment plan to \npay an additional $7,000 with monthly payments over the next 36 months. Lastly, he has \napplied for a reduction of his student loan debt that if finally approved by the Supreme \nCourt would largely forgive most of his student loan debt. In the event that the forgiveness \nplan is not approved by the Court, Applicant will begin repaying his student loans later \nthis year pursuant to an income-driven repayment plan that will keep his monthly payment \nobligation to a level within his means. Applicant\u2019s present financial circumstances and \nactions do not cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. All of the \nabove-quoted mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. Applicant has mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concern. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight \nto the extraordinary circumstances that gave rise to Applicant\u2019s medical debts, past \nstudent loan delinquencies, and bankruptcy. I have also weighed the fact that Applicant\u2019s \nlist of debts in the SOR contain very few consumer debts. This is impressive evidence of \nresponsibility in his control of his expenses during financially difficult times. I have also \nconsidered the timing of Applicant\u2019s remedial steps with respect to settling the medical \ndebts and the small consumer debts. Applicant\u2019s reluctance to borrow from his retirement \naccount until it became obvious that it was necessary for him to do so is understandable \nand represents a conservative approach to his financial planning. The fact that in the end \nhe took that necessary step to address his delinquent debts reflects responsible actions \ntaken to protect his security clearance eligibility and employment. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.dd:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Additionally, I find that AE F accurately reflects withdrawals from Applicant\u2019s bank account to the IRS from June 2018 through May 2023 (addressed further below). Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked since 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1978 until he was honorably discharged in 1987. He then served in the Air National Guard from 1987 to 2001. He was in the Inactive Reserve until he entered the retired rolls of the Air Force in 2020. He attended college for a period, but he has not earned a degree. He is twice divorced. He married his current wife in 2015. He has six children and three stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 24, 52-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B, G) 2 Applicant has a history of financial problems and tax issues, going back to at least 2003. He attributed his financial issues primarily to his daughter who was born in 2003 with significant medical problems. His insurance did not cover all her expenses, and he had to pay a large amount out of pocket. Her condition is permanent and will require medical care throughout her life. He prioritized his daughter and worked multiple jobs, but he was unable to pay all his bills and taxes. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2005, and his dischargeable debts were discharged the same year. (Tr. at 17, 29-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE ",

There was no objection to AE E, and it was admitted in \nevidence. \nDepartment Counsel objected to the admission of AE F on the basis of \nauthenticity and the lack of a verifiable source of the documents. Department Counsel \nalso commented on the weight of the documents if the objection is overruled. \nApplicant was provided an opportunity after Department Counsel\u2019s objection to \nsubmit additional matter. He submitted an email, which I marked AE G and admitted in \nevidence without objection. \nAE F consists of excerpts of Applicant\u2019s bank account statements from June \n2018 through May 2023. He stated that the actual bank statements are 268 pages, and \nhe felt that it was unnecessary to send the full statements, which would have contained \nmuch irrelevant information. The excerpts purportedly show, with several months \nmissing, $700 monthly electronic payments to the IRS. I have considered all the \nevidence in this case, including Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and IRS tax transcripts \nfrom 2013 through 2021. The tax transcripts show that an installment agreement was \nestablished on February 27, 2018. Regular payments in accordance with the installment \nagreement do not appear on the 2013 tax transcript until December 2021, but I believe \nthat is because payments were going to pay taxes for previous tax years. Tax \ntranscripts for earlier tax years are not in the record, but tax transcripts for 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 report that the IRS withheld what would have been refunds \nfor those years and transferred them to pay back taxes for 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008. \nThe payments reflected on the 2013 and 2014 tax transcripts perfectly align with the \nwithdrawals in the offered exhibit. \nThe objection to AE F is overruled, and it is admitted in evidence. Department \nCounsel\u2019s email objecting to the document is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s comments on the weight of the documents are treated as \nargument. \nFindings of Fact \nI adopt any facts addressed in the above evidentiary discussion as a finding of \nfact. Additionally, I find that AE F accurately reflects withdrawals from Applicant\u2019s bank \naccount to the IRS from June 2018 through May 2023 (addressed further below). \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has \nworked since 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1978 until he \nwas honorably discharged in 1987. He then served in the Air National Guard from 1987 \nto 2001. He was in the Inactive Reserve until he entered the retired rolls of the Air Force \nin 2020. He attended college for a period, but he has not earned a degree. He is twice \ndivorced. He married his current wife in 2015. He has six children and three \nstepchildren.

He attributed his financial issues primarily to his daughter who was born in \n2003 with significant medical problems. His insurance did not cover all her expenses, \nand he had to pay a large amount out of pocket. Her condition is permanent and will \nrequire medical care throughout her life. He prioritized his daughter and worked multiple \njobs, but he was unable to pay all his bills and taxes. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ncase in 2005, and his dischargeable debts were discharged the same year. (Tr. at 17, \n29-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 7) \nApplicant owed federal taxes for tax years 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2013, and \n2014. In 2014, the IRS withheld $2,305 from what would have been a refund for tax \nyear 2013 and applied it to his 2003 taxes. However, the IRS later assessed additional \ntaxes, penalties, and interest for 2013 (discussed below). His 2003 taxes were paid in \n2015 when $6,180 was withheld from what would have been a refund for tax year 2014 \nand was applied to his 2003 taxes. The IRS withheld $2,132 from what would have \nbeen that same refund and applied it to his 2006 taxes. The IRS later assessed \nadditional taxes and interest for 2014 (discussed below). (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 7; AE D) \nIn 2016, the IRS withheld $930 from what would have been a refund for tax year \n2015 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. In 2018, the IRS withheld $416 from what would \nhave been a refund for tax year 2017 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. His 2006 taxes \nwere paid in 2019 when $1,715 was withheld from what would have been a refund for \ntax year 2018 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. In 2019, the IRS withheld $416 from \nwhat would have been the same refund and applied it to his 2008 taxes. In April 2020, \nthe IRS withheld $2,468 from what would have been a refund for tax year 2019 and \napplied it to his 2007 taxes. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D) \nIn his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in \nFebruary 2015, Applicant reported his financial problems and tax issues. He reported \nthat he owed $47,000 to the IRS at one time. He wrote that he had worked multiple jobs \nto pay off his debts. He stated that his debt to the IRS was almost paid off. (GE 2) \nApplicant had additional tax issues after he submitted the SF 86. He filed an \nextension for tax year 2013, which extended the due date until October 15, 2014. \nHowever, he did not file his federal income tax return for that year until February 2015. \nIn June 2016, the IRS assessed $9,376 in additional tax. With penalties and interest, \nthe balance rose to more than $14,000. (Tr. at 35-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n7; AE D) \nApplicant established an installment plan with the IRS in February 2018 to pay \n$700 per month by automatic withdrawal from his bank account. He provided \ndocumentation of monthly $700 payments since June 2018. There were payments \nevery month, except October 2018, August 2019, October 2019, December 2019, and \nMarch 2023. In other words, he made 56 payments over the course of 61 months, or \nabout $39,200. The payment in March 2023 was dishonored by Applicant\u2019s bank.

(Tr. at 19-21, 37-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 7; AE D-F) \nBecause Applicant owed the IRS for previous tax years, regular payments \nthrough the installment agreement did not begin for tax year 2013 until December 2021. \nThe IRS also reported a $1,400 payment in December 2019. In April 2022, the IRS \nwithheld what would have been his refund for tax year 2021 and transferred $5,856 to \nhis tax debt for 2013. In March 2023, the last payment was made through the \ninstallment agreement and his tax debt for 2013 was paid in full, leaving only his 2014 \ntaxes to be paid. (Tr. at 37-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D-G) \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2014 on time. The \nfederal income taxes owed were calculated at $12,712, and $21,025 was withheld from \nhis pay. In March 2015, the IRS withheld what would have been his refund for tax year \n2014 and transferred $6,180 to his tax debt for 2003. However, in February 2017, the \nIRS assessed $4,620 in additional taxes. The IRS added $1,455 interest and $1,064 \npenalties, including $25 for the dishonored payment in April 2023. As of September \n2022, he owed $6,827 in taxes, interest, and penalties. The balance was reduced to \n$6,139 as of May 2023. Applicant testified, as supported by an IRS document that I \nviewed over the computer screen but was not offered into evidence, that the balance for \n2014 was down to $5,237. There are no taxes owed for any other tax year. (Tr. at 16, \n41-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D-G) \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2015 in September 2016. \nSince there is no indication that he requested an extension, the return was filed late.\nWhat would have been a refund of $930 was transferred to his 2006 taxes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

AG \u00b6 \n19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and tax issues, going back at least \nto 2003 when his daughter was born with a significant and permanent medical \ncondition. He worked multiple jobs but was unable to pay all his bills and taxes. He filed \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2005 and his dischargeable debts were discharged the \nsame year. Medical costs and tax issues continued after the bankruptcy. \nApplicant owed additional federal taxes for 2013 and 2014 when the IRS \nassessed almost $14,000 in additional taxes. Penalties and interest brought the total \nowed for those two years to about $21,000. Additionally, he still owed for tax years \n2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008. He established an installment plan with the IRS in \nFebruary 2018 to pay $700 per month by automatic withdrawal from his bank account \nfor all his back taxes. He missed five payments, likely because there was not enough in \nhis bank account, but he made 56 payments over the course of 61 months, about \n$39,200. Additionally, between 2014 and 2021, the IRS withheld more than $30,000 \nfrom what would have been refunds and transferred the money to pay his back taxes. \nHis tax liability is now down to less than $6,000. \nApplicant was not as diligent as he should have been about ensuring that his \nfederal income tax returns were filed on time and his taxes paid. However, all the \nreturns have been filed, and Applicant made arrangements with the IRS to pay his back \ntaxes and he is in substantial compliance with those arrangements. AG \u00b6 20(g) is \napplicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nI found Applicant to be honest and truthful. I am convinced that he has learned a \nvaluable and costly lesson, that he will continue with the installment plan until his back \ntaxes are paid, and that all future returns and taxes will be filed and paid on time. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01624 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2022), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s denial of a security clearance where the applicant initiated a \nrepayment plan with the IRS three years before he completed the security clearance \napplication and four years before issuance of the SOR; he had been in compliance with \nthe plan for seven years; and he had paid off approximately 33% of the aggregate debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

During \nthat background interview, Applicant discussed her delinquent debts, including taxes. She \ndiscussed her Federal and state income tax returns. She told the investigator that she did \nnot file her 2016 and 2017 tax returns because she had not received a W-2 Form. She \nwas uncertain of the amount she owed for 2016. As of the date of the interview, she had \nnot filed those returns. (Item 8) \nIn her September 2022 Answer to the SOR, Applicant repeatedly stated that her \ninability to pay her delinquent debts was due to periods of unemployment, being a single \nmother, having no health insurance, and suffering from medical disabilities.

It also alleged that she filed a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy in 2013 and failed to file Federal and state income taxes for 2016. (Items 4, \n5, and 6) The status of these allegations is as follows: \n1.a: In August 2013, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In December 2013, \nthe court discharged $27,000 of delinquent debts. (Item 7) \n1.b through 1.n are debts in collection or charged off. They consist of consumer \ndebts; an unpaid lease; medical bills; a personal loan; credit cards; a car loan; cell phone \nbill; and an insurance premium. Applicant included all of them in her August 2022 payment \nplan. The total amount owed is approximately $34,365. \n1.o: Withdrawn. \n1.p: Applicant has not filed her 2016 Federal income tax return. She stated that \nshe did not file it because in December 2016 she was evicted from her residence and did \nnot have a mailing address. (Item 2) \nApplicant has not filed her 2016 state income tax return, for the reason stated \nabove. \nApplicant participated in financial counseling. Her annual salary for 2022 was \nabout $125,000. She submitted a written budget for June 2022. Her net monthly income \nwas $9,600 and monthly expenses were $8,200, leaving $1,400 remaining.

(Item 2) \n 1.q: \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be \nused in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise security concerns. Three may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2013 and discharged about $27,000 of delinquent debt. Since then, she has accumulated \nabout $34,000 of delinquent debts, which she has been unable to resolve. She also failed \nto file Federal and state income tax returns for 2016. The evidence raises the above \nsecurity concerns, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate \nthose concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been outstanding since 2014 and \ncontinue to be unresolved, which casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to numerous periods of \nunemployment and her medical disabilities. Those were circumstances beyond her \ncontrol. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. She did not provide evidence to demonstrate that she \nattempted to responsibly manage her debts as they were accumulating, or address them \nuntil receiving the SOR more than three years after starting her current job. AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. \nApplicant provided evidence that she participated in financial counseling when she \nentered into a payment plan in August 2022. She submitted a budget that confirms she \nearns a high salary. However, there is insufficient evidence from which to conclude there \nare clear indications that her delinquent debts are coming under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \nminimally applies. She submitted documentation that she made an effort to establish a \nplan to resolve her debts, but she did not provide evidence that she made any payments \ninto the plan, despite being notified of an opportunity to do so after she received the \nFORM in November 2022. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.

AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts and circumstances surrounding \nthis case. Based on the limited evidence and the lack of an established track record of \nresponsible financial management, Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under the guideline for financial considerations. Continuation of \nher financial issues is likely, and the potential for coercion or duress remains \nundiminished. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a through 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 1.o: \nWithdrawn \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n                                     \n \n \n \n  \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

(GE 1-6; SOR Answer) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b - During her April 23, 2021 OPM PSI, Applicant stated that \nshe did not file her Federal and state income tax returns because she thought that she \nwould not owe any money because she did not work much. Sometime in 2018 or 2019, \nshe retained the services of a tax preparer service (TPS) to file her Federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019; however, she did file them until 2022. See \nbelow. The TPS determined that she owed approximately $1,300 to the IRS. She did \nnot pay any delinquent taxes owed at that time relying on her TPS to negotiate a \nreduced balance. She fired that TPS because they were not effective in negotiating any \ntype of settlement or payment plan with the IRS or her state tax authority. As of the date \nof her OPM PSI, she had not paid any of her delinquent taxes because she was \nattempting to negotiate a payment plan with the IRS and her state tax authority. After \nApplicant fired her TPS, her fianc\u00e9 has been helping her with her tax returns. (Tr. 68; \nGE 2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c \u2013 1.e, 1.g - In her Response to DOHA Interrogatories and during \nher testimony, Applicant stated that she filed her Federal income tax return for tax year \n2016 on November 1, 2018, and filed her Federal income tax returns for tax years 2017 \nthrough 2021 on March 6, 2022. However, copies of her Federal tax transcripts \nindicated that the IRS received her 2016 and 2017 Federal income tax returns on \nOctober 17, 2018, but did not receive her 2018 through 2021 Federal tax returns. \nApplicant insisted that she filed all of her Federal income tax returns. She noted in her \nResponse to DOHA Interrogatories that she owed the IRS $1,985 for tax year 2016, \n$3,696 for tax year 2019, and $2,775 for tax year 2020. (Tr. 26-33; GE 2) Also, in her \nJuly 6, 2022 Response to DOHA Interrogatories, she stated that her current outstanding \nFederal tax liability was $1,985 for tax year 2016, $3,696 for tax year 2019, and $2,775 \nfor tax year 2020. (GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b - Post-hearing, Applicant submitted copies of her 2018 and \n2019 Federal tax transcripts that the IRS processed on March 11, 2022, and April 18, \n2022, respectively. (Tr. 37-41; AE B, AE C) Although Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation that the IRS received her 2020 and 2021 Federal income tax returns, \ngiven the staggered dates of IRS receipt, I accept her explanation that she did submit \nthem; however, they were not timely filed as required.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[full cite here] Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and her financial problems are not isolated. Her debt, \nparticularly as it pertains to her delinquent taxes, remains a \u201ccontinuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \nApplicant is able to receive partial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g), but does \nnot receive full credit under either of these two mitigating conditions because of her \nfailure to act responsibly under the circumstances and the time elapsed before \naddressing these obligations. Applicant has made some progress towards her paying \nher delinquent taxes. Of concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file her Federal \nand state income tax returns and pay her taxes owed as required. She did not offer a \nplausible explanation for failing to do so. Her motivation to address her taxes only \nbecame a priority after her clearance became an issue. The remaining mitigating \nconditions are not applicable. \nApplicant was alerted to the fact that her failure to file these returns and her \ndebts were a concern to the Government during her April 23, 2021 OPM PSI and later \nwhen she received her August 3, 2022 SOR. These events apparently did not prompt \nApplicant to recognize the seriousness of her situation and take immediate corrective \naction given Applicant\u2019s age, education, and experience. The evidence of record does \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nnot mitigate such a lapse in judgment. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant did \nnot act responsibly with regard to timely filing her Federal and state income tax returns \nand paying or making payment arrangements for taxes owed. \nIn regard to the failure to file timely Federal income tax returns when due, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.\n15, 2016): \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). (emphasis in original) \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g are not mitigated.  \nForeign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of the Philippines. Department \nCounsel did not offer a country summary identifying country-specific concerns. Given \nthe history of the positive relationship that exists between the United States and the \nPhilippines, especially since World War II, the heightened-risk element is minimally \nsatisfied. That said, the Government established its case under Guideline B as a result \nof Applicant\u2019s contact with her niece who manages her modest real property holdings in \nthe Philippines. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position or having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \nThe Philippines\u2019s relationship with the United States, and the minimum \nheightened risk it presents, place a less than heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the \nsecurity concern. Applicant self-reported her Philippine connections and discussed them \nfreely. She appears to have cooperated fully and provided truthful information regarding \nthose connections throughout the security clearance process. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to the Philippines via her niece \nand the modest property she manages for Applicant in the Philippines. Applicant has \nspent the majority of her adult life in the United States. She became a U.S. citizen in a \nrelatively short time after immigrating to the United States in 1982. She has spent the \nmajority of her adult life in the United States. Her five siblings all reside in the United \nStates and are naturalized U.S. citizens. More importantly, her two biological adult sons \nare U.S.-born citizens and reside in the United States. Applicant maintains contact with \nall of her siblings and sons in varying degrees. Her fianc\u00e9 is a U.S.-born citizen with \nwhom she cohabitates. Although the family ties to the Philippines continue to be \nrelevant security considerations and cannot be dismissed out of hand, the strength of \nthose ties are diminished given the facts and circumstances here. On balance, her ties \nto the United States are far stronger than the family ties to the Philippines. \nGiven the totality of the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Philippines. I further conclude there is no conflict \nof interest because Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships \nand loyalties in the United States that she can be expected to resolve any potential \nconflict of interest in the favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable. \nConclusion \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988), and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I have weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Her admissions \nare incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nthis employer for over two years. She experienced periods of unemployment from \nDecember 2020 to June 2021; from February 2018 to April 2018; and from July 2013 to \nDecember 2013. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and has taken some courses toward a \nmaster\u2019s. She is single, never married, and has no children. This is her first application \nfor a position of trust. (Tr. at 6, 37; 40-41; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant accumulated 11 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $38,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). The delinquent debts included two student \nloans, two car-repossession deficiencies, three medical debts, and four credit card or \nconsumer debts. The debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions to a background \ninvestigator in August 2021; credit reports from June 2021, January 2022, and \nSeptember 2023; and her admissions in her SOR answer. (GE 2-5; SOR answer) \nApplicant testified that she was financially illiterate growing up. Even when she \nentered college and began taking out student loans, she remained financially \nunsophisticated. Consequently, she agreed to cosign a car loan for her mother and took \nout credit cards without realizing the impact these actions would have on her overall \nfinancial wellbeing. She has dealt with family issues including the death of her father \nand her brother\u2019s shooting. She indicated that with the exception of two medical debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j), she has not made any payments on the rest of the SOR debts. (Tr. 19, \n44) \nConcerning her student loans, Applicant gave conflicting information about \nwhether they were forgiven. During her background interview with an investigator in \nAugust 2021, which she authenticated in July 2022, she admitted having multiple \nfederal student loans for which she failed to make any payments. She admitted these \nloans became delinquent, but she could not recall when that was. She claimed that she \napplied for a loan forgiveness program, qualified for the program, and the student loans \nwere then forgiven. She did not provide any documentation to corroborate this action. \n(GE 2) The SOR student-loan debt appears on her June 2021 credit report with the \nfollowing information: \nDate Reported: 06/21; Date Assigned: 09/06; Activity Date: 06/21; \nBalance Date: 06/21; Narrative 1: Acct 120 days past due; Narrative 4: \nCharged-off Acct.

Applicant also admitted that \nshe has never made student loan payments. It appears Applicant\u2019s current student-loan \npayment status may be the result of President Biden\u2019s action pausing the collection of \nstudent loans due to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan \npayments. (Tr. 23, 27, 44; GE 2-5) \nApplicant testified that she planned to work with a credit repair agent or company \nto deal with her delinquent debts. She has looked into doing so, but as of the hearing, \nshe had not contacted any person or group yet. She also will look into loan forgiveness \nconcerning her student loans. Once she completes making her car payments of $450 \nmonthly (no payoff date stated), she will use those funds to pay her delinquent debts. \nShe provided a copy of her monthly budget that shows she has a monthly remainder of \napproximately $700 after paying all bills. She documented making payments for the two \nmedical debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j. Those two debts are resolved. She has not \nreceived financial counseling or otherwise enhanced her knowledge of financial issues. \n(Tr. 23, 31, 35-37, 42, 44-45; AE A-C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $38,000. With \nthe exception of paying two small medical debts, she failed to address the remaining \ndebts. I find all disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans \ndue to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\nstudent-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent student \nloans.

I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Except for two small medical debts, Applicant has \nnot documented payment towards any other SOR debts. While periods of \nunemployment and her family issues were circumstances beyond her control, she has \nnot shown responsible action toward addressing her delinquent debts. She failed to \nmake any student loan payments or address her other debts. None of the above \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances. However, she has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of financial responsibility, which causes me to \nquestion her ability to resolve her debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.h, 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.i \u2013 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2017. He seeks to obtain a security clearance. He attended \ncommunity college for three years but did not earn a degree. He is single and has no \nchildren. (GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21.) \nApplicant has a history of marijuana use. In his 2021 Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86), he reported using marijuana about two to three times a year \nsocially between 2011 and 2019. (GE 1 at 65 and Tr. at 17-18 27, 28.) After joining his \nemployer he was assigned work that required international travel and he started to use \nmarijuana to help him sleep. (Tr. at 14, 17.) He stated on the SF 86 that he intended to \nuse marijuana in the future because it helped him sleep.

(Tr. at 31.)  \nApplicant lived in a state where marijuana became legal under state law about \nmidway during the period alleged. (Tr. at 27.) He stated he never illegally purchased \nmarijuana but understood it was an illegal controlled substance under Federal law. (Tr. at \n16, 21.) He admitted using marijuana in a social setting one or two times after receiving \nthe SOR. His last use was about month before the hearing. He felt the security clearance \napplication process was \u201cextremely slow\u201d and the project he would have used a security \nclearance for had been completed so he used marijuana. He acknowledged this was not \nan excuse. (Tr. at 18, 21, 23, 27.) He listed on his SF 86 as references, persons with \nwhom he used marijuana socially. (Tr. at 29.) \nApplicant testified he had been told by work colleagues, who also used marijuana \nand held DoD security clearances, that if he was truthful, he would not have a problem. \n(Tr. at 30-31.) When asked to divulge the people smoking marijuana while holding a DoD \nsecurity clearance, he declined to answer the question. (Tr. at 32.) He added that since \nhe did not have a security clearance, he would not report them. (Tr. at 36.)

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant admitted he used marijuana, purchased marijuana, and expressed an \nintent to continue to use marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(f) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates \n4 \n\n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant knew throughout the periods of time \nalleged that his use and purchasing of marijuana was prohibited under Federal law. He \ncontinued to purchase and use marijuana after applying for a security clearance and after \nbeing placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security \nclearance. He continued to associate with others who use marijuana. In doing so, \nApplicant not only knowingly violated Federal drug laws but also disregarded security \nclearance eligibility standards. This behavior raises substantial questions about \nApplicant's judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. See ISCR Case No. 20-02974 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). Applicant's \nwillingness to sign a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future does not \nmitigate the scope of these security concerns. Nor does the passage of a little over a \nmonth between his last use of marijuana and the hearing eliminate those concerns. None \nof the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

The case was \nassigned to me on April 28, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 32 years old, married, with two children ages four and five. (Item 3.) \nFrom September 2009 to May 2013, he went to college in State A, where he earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. From November 2013 to August 2019, he held a number of jobs in \nState A. From September 2019 to June 2021, he lived in State B, where he earned his \ngraduate degree. He then returned to State A in July 2021, where he currently lives. His \nclearance sponsor is a federal contractor. This is his first security clearance application. \n(Items 3 and 4.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from March 2011 to about June 2021. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations. (Item 2.) In his SCA, he elaborated on his marijuana use. He \u201csmoked \nmarijuana in college\u2026[took] edibles rarely over the last couple years\u2026[maybe] once \nevery couple weeks.\u201d Marijuana is currently legal in State B. If marijuana is legal in State \nA, he \u201cmay use it in the future in a social setting.\u201d (Item 3.) \nIn his July 27, 2022 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant further explained \nhis marijuana use and his intentions for future use. He confirmed the approximate dates \nof his past marijuana use. His statements in the PSI about future use, however, are \ninconsistent. On the one hand, he said he stopped using marijuana in July 2021, when \nhe returned to State A, where marijuana is illegal. On the other hand, he said he intends \nto use marijuana in the future because it is legal in State A and State B. In his response \nto an interrogatory, he said his intent is to use \u201coccasionally if legal in location.\u201d In \nresponse to the query \u201cdo you intend to use marijuana . . . in the future,\u201d he checked the \nanswer \u201cNo.\u201d (Item 4.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

AG \u00b6 24 sets \nforth the concern in more detail below: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance. \nApplicant admitted that he purchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from March 2011 to June 2021. Facts admitted by an applicant in an \nanswer to an SOR or in an interview require no further proof from the Government. \nISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] \nmade to the SOR allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of \nproof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd.

The knowing or intentional \npossession and use of any such substance is unlawful and punishable by imprisonment, \na fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 memorandum, the Director of \nNational Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is a security concern. James R. \nClapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: Adherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting \nMarijuana \nUse \n(October \n25, \n2014). \nSee \nalso \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml. LSD and cocaine are Schedule I and Schedule II \ncontrolled substances, respectively, under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n811 et seq. See http://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nIn this case, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. Applicant is under \nthe misapprehension that state law governs the legality of marijuana purchase and use. \nThat is incorrect. Marijuana purchase and use continue to raise national security concerns \nunder federal law that must be mitigated. His conflicting statements in his PSI sow doubts \nabout his intention to use marijuana in the future. \nOnly mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) potentially applies here. That condition states: \n\u201c[T]he behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d It is true that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana \nbegan quite some time ago, in March 2011 while he was in college. His use, however, \ncontinued with varying frequency until June 2021, just a month after he completed his \nSCA. A two-year period of abstinence, especially in light of his equivocal future intent, is \ninsufficient to allay national security concerns. On these facts, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n26(a) does not apply. \nIn reaching this conclusion, I have also carefully considered the other mitigating \nconditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) through (d). On their face, those mitigating conditions \ndo not apply in this case. I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and \nability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.

He is applying for the position of Aircraft Painter 3. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to seventeen separate creditors totaling $79,855, which consists of delinquent collection and charged-off accounts. In his answer, Applicant admits all of the allegations, except 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.o., and 1.q., which he contends he has paid off, settled, or made payments on. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 30, 2020; April 25, 2020; and August 8, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)

These \nexhibits were identified by Applicant to correspond to specific allegations in the SOR. \nDOHA received the final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 24, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old. He is unmarried and has two sons, ages 9 and 16 \nyears of age. He has some college education. He is applying for the position of Aircraft \nPainter 3. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to seventeen separate creditors \ntotaling $79,855, which consists of delinquent collection and charged-off accounts. In \nhis answer, Applicant admits all of the allegations, except 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.o., and 1.q., \nwhich he contends he has paid off, settled, or made payments on. (Applicant\u2019s Answer \nto SOR.) \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated March 30, 2020; April 25, 2020; and \nAugust 8, 2022, confirm this indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.) \nApplicant explained that he fell behind on paying his bills due to his lack of \nknowledge on how to properly handle his finances with limited resources. He admits \nthat he has been negligent. He was raised in a poverty-stricken area where the median \nhousehold income is $22,000 annually. Applicant has been raising his two children and \ntaking care of his grandmother. (Tr. pp. 28-29, and 69.) \nApplicant began working for a defense contactor located in State A in June 2020. \nHis goal was to transfer to their facility in State B to be closer to his children who live \nthere. Apparently at some point he transferred to work at the facility in State B. Once \nthere, he did not find the workplace welcoming. He claims that he was the victim of \nconstant discriminatory, derogatory and racist remarks that have caused him mental \ndistress. He was the only African American in the office of about 80 employees. He \nstated that after a period of trying to work in the toxic environment, he could no longer \ntolerate the abusive working conditions. He has been on Family Medical Leave from his \njob since May 24, 2022. He stated that he is supporting himself and living on what is \nleft in his 401(k). He explained that he is seeing a psychiatrist for his mental condition. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe has moved out of State B and back to State A, and has applied for a job with \nanother defense contractor who is currently sponsoring him for a security clearance. \n(Tr. pp. 29-40.) \nApplicant stated that he has filed for social security disability insurance benefits \nand short-term disability. He recently learned that he will receive back pay, and he \nplans to use the majority of his money to pay his delinquent debt. Applicant testified \nthat he is currently about $10,000 behind on his rent in State A. He is not being evicted \nbecause of the COVID 19 protections that are in place. (Tr. p. 66.) \nThe following delinquent debt set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount \nof $24,295. This debt is for a vehicle that was totaled in an accident. Applicant\u2019s car \nwas hit in the back, and his car hit a vehicle in front of his. Applicant\u2019s insurance had \nlapsed, and did not cover the cost of his vehicle. He states that he is currently working \nwith the creditor to set up a payment plan. The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 43.) \n1.b. A delinquent debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount \nof $6,139. Applicant was a tenant who completed his lease, and began living month to \nmonth without paying rent for a month and a half. \nThis was during COVID 19. \nApplicant was temporary laid off from work at the time. He states that he is currently \nworking with the creditor to set up a payment plan. The debt remains owing. (Tr. p. \n46.) \n1.c. A delinquent debt owed to an energy company was placed for collection in \nthe amount of $1,508. Applicant made one payment of $50 at the beginning of COVID \n19, and then stopped due to financial hardship. He is currently working with the creditor \nto set up a payment plan. The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 48.) \n1.d. A delinquent debt owed to a car rental company was placed for collection in \nthe amount of $1,472. Applicant explained that he rented a vehicle, and he had it three \ndays longer than he had rented it, and they came to pick it up. Applicant stated that he \nneeded it to take his children to school. Applicant contends that the account has been \nclosed, and he does not know who to contact about setting up payment arrangements. \nThe debt still shows outstanding on his most recent credit report. The debt remains \nowing. (Tr. p. 50.) \n1.e. A delinquent debt owed to a creditor for a credit card was charged-off in the \namount of $984. The debt occurred during COVID 19. Applicant testified that he was \nworking with the creditor to set up payment arrangements. On November 9, 2022, \nApplicant settled the debt for $590.70. (Tr. p. 51, and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit \nE.) The debt has been resolved. \n1.f.

He used that money to pay off some of his delinquent \ndebts.  (Tr. p. 55.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred excessive delinquent debt for a variety of reasons. At times, \nhe has lived beyond his means and spent money on extravagant things. Purchasing a \nCorvette for $80,000 when he was financially strapped was not a good decision. On \nother occasions, he may not have been earning enough money to cover his bills. As a \nresult, he incurred debt that he has not been able to pay. In addition, he states that he \nhas been the victim of discrimination that may have impacted his ability to pay his bills. \nAnd finally, it is not clear whether he has ignored his debt for many years, and focused \non other priorities in his life. In any event, his actions or inactions both demonstrated a \nhistory of not addressing his responsibility and an inability to pay his delinquent debt. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has made progress toward resolving his delinquent debts and he is \ncommended for these efforts. He has settled a number of his debts and resolved about \n$31,000. However, he remains delinquently indebted and currently owes in excess of \n$48,000, that he cannot show how he can pay. Not to mention his delinquent back rent \nof now $10,000 that will be due when his COVID restriction are lifted. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant has not demonstrated that he can live within his means and \ncomfortably pay his delinquent debts. \nApplicant does not meet the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried \nhis burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Additionally, he did \nnot mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, regarding his \n2012 attempt to submit a false urine sample for a drug test. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 14, 2021. On \nJuly 15, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse. The CAF issued the SOR \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to me on April 11, 2023. On April 24, \n2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling \nthe hearing for May 18, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nand 2, which were admitted without objection.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 25, 2023. \nAmendment to the SOR \nBefore the hearing, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add the following \nallegation under Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \n2.a:  On or about June 2012, you used someone else\u2019s specimen during \nan employer conducted drug urinalysis test.  \nApplicant did not answer the new allegation before the hearing. During \npreliminary matters, he acknowledged receipt of the amended SOR, offered no \nobjections and admitted the allegation.

He tested positive for marijuana \nduring his initial screening but was allowed to remain in the program and had no \nadditional positive drug tests. (This is not alleged in the SOR). In 2004, he left the job \nprogram and resumed using marijuana. (GX 2; Tr. 33-36) \nOver time, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use increased to almost daily. His use continued \nuntil 2012, when he refused to provide a second urine sample, as requested, during an \nemployer-directed drug test. His refusal was considered a failed drug test by his \nemployer and he was released from his assigned contract. (See further discussion, \nbelow). With the loss of income, he could no longer afford marijuana and stopped using \nit for about a year. However, once he got another job, he resumed smoking marijuana \nabout twice a week. (GX 1-2; Tr. 62-65) \nApplicant would often smoke on his own, with his son\u2019s mother or with friends. In \nabout 2018, he stopped seeing his son\u2019s mother and obtained full custody of his son. \nAlthough he stopped seeing the friends with whom he used marijuana, he continued to \nregularly purchase and use marijuana through about April 2021. He stopped using \nmarijuana in order to pass an initial drug screening for his employer. (Tr. 30-32, 75-76) \nIn his May 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had purchased and used \nmarijuana \u201chundreds of times\u201d up until a month before his security clearance \napplication. However, he also stated his intent to terminate future marijuana use. (GX 1) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he was committed to not using marijuana in \nthe future. He described his personal growth, health and life changes as well as trying to \nbe a good father as reasons why he no longer intended to use marijuana. (Tr. 69-70, 77) \nMisuse of Prescription Medications \nIn about 2003, while working with the job program, Applicant experienced a \npainful medical condition and was given a prescription for Percocet. Later, he received \nVicodin at the hospital for a toothache. In both instances, he liked the way these \nnarcotics made him feel and described becoming addicted to them. (Tr. 46-49) \nAfter his prescriptions ran out, Applicant continued using Percocet or Vicodin \nweekly. He would illegally use these narcotics with his son\u2019s mother. She would either \nget them from the doctor\u2019s office where she worked, or she would purchase them from a \nfriend. Applicant would give her money to purchase the narcotics. (GX 1; Tr. 51-53) \nApplicant testified that he stopped using Percocet in 2018, primarily because it \nresulted in stomach issues. However, he continued taking Vicodin without a prescription \nthrough late 2020 or early 2021. He did not seek out any treatment or counseling to \nassist in terminating his use. However, he testified that he has no further intent to take \nnarcotics without a prescription because he was getting older and was trying to set a \ngood example for his son.

Knowing that he would \ntest positive for marijuana, Applicant called several friends in an effort to obtain clean \nurine to submit for the test. He then concealed the friend\u2019s urine in his jeans when he \nentered the testing facility. However, when he submitted the sample, the lab technician \nsuspected something was wrong and asked him to submit a second sample. He \nrefused, pretended to be sick and left the facility. His refusal was considered a failed \ndrug test by his employer and he was released from his assigned contract. (Tr. 59-68) \nAlthough Applicant disclosed details of this event in his Answer to the SOR and \nat hearing, he provided conflicting accounts during previous aspects of his investigation. \nIn both his SCA and background interview, he stated he did not know why he was \nrequested to submit a second urine sample. Yet, he knew the first sample was not his \nurine. He later claimed that he did not share details of his efforts to subvert the 2012 \ndrug test during the investigation because he forgot. (GX 1-2; Answer) \nApplicant acknowledged that his attempt to submit a false urine sample was a \n\u201chorrible idea\u201d that he would not repeat. However, he did resume using marijuana \nafterwards. (Tr. 78) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \n\u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school in 1999. He stopped using \nmarijuana in 2003 after failing a drug test and again in 2012 after he attempted to \nsubmit a false urine sample to a drug test and lost his job. However, besides those two \nbrief periods of abstinence, he regularly used marijuana through spring 2021. He also \nmisused prescription Percocet from 2003 through 2018 and prescription Vicodin from \n2003 through about 2020-2021. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.c. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in 2012 was initially alleged under Guideline H, SOR \u00b6 1.d \nwhich essentially stated that Applicant failed a drug test in 2012, when he refused to \ncomply with a request for a second urinalysis test after the first test proved inconclusive. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s urine was never tested in 2012. He explained in his Answer that \nwhat he really did was attempt to subvert the test by submitting someone else\u2019s urine as \nhis own sample. As a result, the Government amended the SOR to allege that conduct \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct. (See discussion below). While he was \nconsidered by his employer to have \u201cfailed the drug test\u201d since he did not complete it, in \nfact he did not actually test positive for an illegal drug. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25(b) is not \napplicable and the security concern alleged under SOR \u00b61.d has not been established \nunder Guideline H. (The security significance of his personal conduct is discussed \nunder Guideline E, below). \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse was both recent and \nfrequent. In 2021, he stopped using marijuana and misusing prescription narcotics in \norder to maintain his employment. He also no longer associates with several of the \npersons with whom he previously used drugs. He described several recent changes to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nhis environment and other circumstances that reflect positively on his ability to abstain \nfrom future drug use or misuse of prescription narcotics. Nevertheless, on two prior \noccasions, he stopped using marijuana for a brief period, only to eventually resume his \nuse. He has not yet established a sufficient pattern of abstinence to show that his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse are fully behind him. The circumstances and extent \nof Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use preclude application of either mitigation conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or (b). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 16 and the following is potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \ngovernment protected information; (2) any disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources. \nIn 2012, Applicant attempted to submit another person\u2019s urine sample for an \nemployer-directed drug test. In so doing, he attempted to conceal his drug use from his \nemployer and failed to follow rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s actions raise serious \nquestions of judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b6 16(d) is applicable. The \ngeneral security concern under AG \u00b6 15 also applies. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nAt his hearing, Applicant described details of his efforts to subvert an employer-\ndirected drug test in 2012. His attempted submission of a false urine sample during the \ntest was not a minor offense. Further, he previously stated during his investigation that \nhe did not know why he was requested to submit a second urine sample. That was \nplainly not the case since he knew the first sample was not his urine. While significant \ntime has passed since this event, these subsequent conflicting statements about what \nhe did undercut his candor and credibility. This, coupled with the recency of his drug \nuse, continues to raise concerns regarding his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment \nand do not show sufficient changed circumstances to mitigate the personal conduct \nconcerns. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) or (d) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant regularly used marijuana and misused prescription narcotics for nearly \ntwenty years. In 2012, he attempted to conceal his drug use from his employer by \ndevising an elaborate scheme to submit someone else\u2019s urine for a drug test. Despite \nhis recognition that it was a \u201chorrible idea,\u201d he continued using marijuana and misusing \nprescription narcotics until 2021. Although he described several changed circumstances \nand his own maturation as factors in support of his efforts to remain drug free, the \nfrequency, recency and seriousness of his conduct leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to his suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline H and \nGuideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(Items 2, 15) \nRussia \nRussia has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system dominated by \nPresident Vladimir Putin. The bicameral federal assembly lacks independence from the \nexecutive. The 2018 presidential election and the 2021 lower-house elections were \nmarked by accusations of government interference and manipulation of the electoral \nprocess. A July 2020 referendum on constitutional amendments did not meet \ninternationally recognized standards, and the new constitutional amendments provide \nPresident Putin the opportunity to remain in power until 2036. \nThe U.S. Government has escalated sanctions on Russia since 2014, in \nresponse to Russia\u2019s incursions into Ukraine, cyberattacks, malign influence, use of \nchemical weapons, and election meddling. In its February 2022 Annual Threat \nAssessment, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) reported that \nRussia presents one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States, \nusing its intelligence services, proxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to divide \nWestern alliances and increase its sway around the world, while attempting to \nundermine U.S. global standing, amplify discord inside the United States, and \ninfluence U.S. voters and decision making. ODNI also assessed that Russia will \nremain a top cyber threat as it refines and employs its espionage, influence, and attack \ncapabilities. \nIn July 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center reported that \nbesides cyberspace, other methods of collecting sensitive U.S. technologies include \nuse of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West; \nrecruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills by the Russian \nintelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and private \nenterprises. Under Russian law, the Federal Security Service (FSB) can compel \nRussian firms doing business in the United States, or Russians working with U.S. \nfirms, to comply with FSB information sharing and operational mandates, presenting \nadditional routes for cyber espionage. \nThe U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Russia, \nadvising U.S. persons not to travel to Russia due to unprovoked and unjustified \ninvasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces; the potential for harassment against \nU.S. citizens by Russian government security officials; the singling out of U.S. citizens \nin Russia by Russian government security officials, including for detention; the arbitrary \nenforcement of local law; limited flights into and out of Russia; the U.S. Embassy\u2019s \nlimited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia; COVID-19 and related entry restrictions; \nand terrorism. U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately.  \nU.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. Government and military \npersonnel and private citizens engaged in business, who are visiting or residing in \nRussia have been interrogated without cause and threatened by Russian officials, and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. All U.S. Government \npersonnel should carefully consider their need to travel to Russia. Russian security \nservices have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious charges, singled out U.S. citizens in \nRussia for detention and/or harassment, denied them fair and transparent treatment, \nand convicted them in secret trials and/or without presenting credible evidence. \nRussian officials may unreasonably delay U.S. consular assistance to detained U.S. \ncitizens. Russia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S-Russian nationals and may \nrefuse to acknowledge dual nationals\u2019 U.S. citizenship, deny their access to U.S. \nconsular assistance, prevent their departure from Russia, and conscript dual nationals \nfor military service. \nRussia has used counterterrorism and \u201cextremism\u201d as pretexts to suppress the \nexercise of human rights, or for other objectives in both domestic and foreign policy. \nThe formal counterterrorism dialogue framework between the United States and \nRussia remained on hold because of public, unfounded statements by Russian \nsecurity officials alleging U.S. support for ISIS. \nIn its 2020 Human Rights Report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsignificant human rights issues in Russia included: extrajudicial killings and attempted \nextrajudicial killings; enforced disappearances; pervasive torture by law enforcement \nofficers; harsh and life-threatening conditions prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; \npolitical and religious prisoners and detainees; politically motivated reprisals against \nindividuals located outside the country; severe arbitrary interference with privacy; \nsevere suppression of freedom of expression and media; violence against journalists; \nblacking and filtering of internet content and banning of online anonymity; severe \nsuppression of the right of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; severe \nrestrictions of religious freedom; refoulement of refugees; inability of citizens to change \ntheir government peacefully through free and fair elections; severe limits on \nparticipation in the political process; widespread corruption at all levels and in all \nbranches of government; lack of investigation of and accountability for violence against \nwomen; coerced abortion and forced sterilization; trafficking in persons; and crimes \ninvolving violence or threats of violence against persons with disabilities, members of \nethnic minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons. The \ngovernment failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, or punish \nmost officials who committed abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \nIn March 2022, President Putin signed into law a bill criminalizing the spread of \ninformation in Russia that authorities deem as \u201cfalse information\u201d that contradicts the \nRussian narrative of its military actions in Ukraine. The Russian government \ncensorship agency blocked access to social media platforms, and restricted access in \nRussia to international news outlets.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmember living under a foreign government. Applicant\u2019s father, stepmother, and half-\nsisters are Russian citizens residing in Russia. Russia presents one of the most serious \nforeign influence threats to the United States. The U.S. Department of State issued a \nLevel 4 travel advisory for Russia, advising U.S. persons not to travel to Russia. Russia \nenforces special restrictions on dual U.S-Russian nationals. Although she stated that \nher communication with her father decreased, she had weekly telephonic and electronic \ncontact with her father and stepmother, and monthly electronic contact with her half-\nsisters, as of her 2021 SCA. She also saw her family in Russia when she traveled there \nin 2008, 2009, and 2011. Her father and stepmother are aware that she is seeking a \nnational security position. The totality of the evidence in the record demonstrates that \nApplicant\u2019s family in Russia creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). Although Applicant has not traveled to Russia since 2011, as of her \n2021 SCA, she maintained weekly contact with her father and stepmother and monthly \ncontact with her half-sisters there. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant complied with \nreporting requirements, to include reporting her family in Russia in her SCA, during her \nbackground interview, and in her Answer. AG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2008. She is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen and holds a U.S. passport. Her spouse is a permanent U.S. resident, and their \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchildren are native-born U.S. citizens. They have owned their home in the United States \nsince 2019. These are factors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, her ties to her \nfamily in Russia are also strong. She failed to meet her burden to demonstrate that she \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying her \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her delinquent debts. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. As demonstrated by the DISS incident report, she began \nresolving her self-reported debts before the SOR was issued. She paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, \n2.d, 2.e, 2.f in June 2022. She stated that she paid all the SOR debts in June and July \n2022, and none of the SOR debts are reported on the most recent credit bureau report \nfrom October 2022 \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payment on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she \nneed only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant does not have any other delinquent debts. While she did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate her efforts that she paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.g through 2.k, \nshe has demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and she has the means \nto continue to resolve them. I find that Applicant\u2019s finances do not continue to cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) \nare established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but she did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her foreign connections. Accordingly, I conclude she has \nnot carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application (SCA) on August 26, 2021. \nThe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 3, 2022, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DOD as \nof June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an answer (Answer) to the SOR on August 11, 2022 and \nelected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On August 30, 2022, Department Counsel submitted \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as \nItems 1 through 6. DOHA sent the FORM to Applicant on September 6, 2022, who \nreceived it on September 9, 2022. She was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not \nrespond to the FORM. The SOR and the Answer (Items 1S and 1A, respectively) are the \npleadings in the case. Items 2 through 6 are admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on December 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 33 years old, married (March 2017), and has no children. She earned \nan associate\u2019s degree in May 2013 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. Since March \n2021, she has worked for a defense contractor. (Item 2.) \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent federal student loans totaling $35,230 and two \ndelinquent consumer debts totaling $2,820. (Item 1S.) Applicant admitted the student loan \nallegations, stating: \u201cI was making payments to my loans and then Covid-19 put \neverything on hold and I wasn\u2019t allowed to make payments. I will resume making \npayments when allowed.\u201d She denied the two consumer debts, saying that they had been \npaid in full. She produced no documents. (Item 1A.) In her October 5, 2021 Personal \nSubject Interview (PSI), she explained further about her student loans: \nShe took about $25,000 to $30,000 per year in loans for a total of \n$50,000. She started making payments monthly payments of $130 in 2015. \nShe had no problems making those payments until Covid-19 froze all \npayments in the spring of 2020. No payments were expected. She has not \nbeen notified when payments will be starting again. She has heard nothing \nfrom creditors, a collection agency, or a government agency. That was why \nshe did not list these loans on her [SCA]. She believed they were in good \nstanding. She said the current balance is about $35,000. (Item 3.) \nApplicant completed a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) on March 22, 2022. \nShe and her spouse earn $5,000 per month. Their monthly expenses and debt service \ntotal $3,000. Thus, their net monthly remainder is $1,994. (Item 4.) \nEach of Applicant\u2019s federal student loans are noted as follows on the credit reports: \nPLACED FOR COLLECTION, STUDENT LOAN ASSIGNED TO GOVERNMENT, \nCLOSED. Otherwise, her credit reports show no defaults, save for the two SOR non-\nstudent loan accounts she claims have been paid in full. (Items 5 and 6.) \nThe following is the latest on the status of the federal student loan program: \n2 \n\n \nThe student loan payment pause began in March 2020. The student loan \npayment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of Education [DOE] is \npermitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation is resolved. \nPayments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program has not been \nimplemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023 \u2013 \npayments will resume 60 days after that. We [DOE] will notify borrowers \nbefore payments restart. \nCOVID-19 Emergency Relief and Federal Student Aid https://studentaid.gov>covid-\n19/public-service-loan-forgiveness. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. I \nhave considered the following three conditions, because they are the ones most \ncommonly implicated in financial cases: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant spent five years faithfully paying $130 per month to defray her student \nloans. That track record was interrupted only by Covid-19 and the federal government\u2019s \npayment pause. She has stated her willingness to resume payments when notified. Her \nPFS shows she is quite capable of resuming those payments. The payment pause \nremains in effect, until further notice by the Government. None of the three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions quoted above apply. Nor do any other conditions in AG \u00b6 19 \napply. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \n\u00b6 20. \nThe amounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1i. and 1.l do not raise national security concerns. \nI find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about her eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n4 \n\n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.l.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

The investigation revealed that \nApplicant wrongfully used a controlled substance in violation of Article 112a, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ). (Items 6, 10) Applicant\u2019s commander imposed \nnonjudicial punishment, pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, on September 22, 2021, reducing \nhim from staff sergeant (pay grade E-5) to senior airman (pay grade E-4), and ordered \nthat he be given a formal reprimand.

He added that since his discharge from the Air Force, he has \nstrong family support in the form of his two older brothers. He lives with his oldest \nbrother and spends time with his other brother. Both brothers have Top Secret \nclearances. He states that his brothers have been a positive influence on him by \nencouraging him to finish his bachelor\u2019s degree and to pursue his goals in spite of \nsetbacks. He gave his assurances that he would not use illegal drugs again and would \nlike the opportunity to serve the Government in the future. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), and 25(f). Further discussion is \nrequired. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug\ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future\ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security\neligibility; \n \n \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows, \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For \nthe recency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s most recent cocaine use occurred in August 2021, 11 months before \nhis July 2022 SOR was issued, and 13 months before Department Counsel\u2019s FORM. \nApplicant asserts that he has turned his life around, that he no longer wants to use \nillegal drugs, and will not use illegal drugs in the future. Among the problems here is the \nrecency of his illegal drug use and his use while granted access to classified \ninformation. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s written assertions that he is drug-free and has no \nintention of using illegal drugs in the future lack corroboration. While Applicant\u2019s ADAPT \nprogress notes are favorable, his ADAPT program ended in November 2021. There is \nno recent information comparable to his ADAPT progress notes confirming sobriety \nsince he was discharged from the Air Force in January 2022. Accordingly, mitigation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit under AG \u00b6 26(a) is not warranted at this time. Applicant is able to receive partial \ncredit for acknowledging his drug involvement and substance misuse under AG \u00b6 26(b) \nfor and changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used under subsection \n(2). However, the overall circumstances do not warrant full mitigation of security \nconcerns under Guideline H. In summary, apart from partial application of AG \u00b6 26(b), \nno other mitigating conditions fully apply. \nPersonal Conduct  \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the information under SOR \u00b6 1.a (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) as a personal conduct concern. A review of the disqualifying \nconditions under personal do not warrant application with regard to the facts of this \ncase. However, and more appropriately, disqualifying conditions under drug involvement \nand substance misuse and criminal conduct do apply. Accordingly, I find for Applicant \nunder personal conduct security concerns. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nThe evidence establishes AG \u00b6 31(b). Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the\noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \nThe comments under drug involvement and substance misuse are incorporated \nin this section. Applicant deserves credit for acknowledging his behavior and for \nparticipating in ADAPT before being discharged from the Air Force. He also deserves \ncredit for pursuing his college degree and choosing an environment where he has \nstrong family support and positive role models in the form of his two older brothers. \nPartial credit under Application of AG \u00b6 31(d) is warranted. However, the facts do not \nwarrant application of the remaining mitigating conditions under this concern. As noted \nin the discussion under drug involvement and substance misuse, not enough time has \nelapsed since Applicant\u2019s drug use coupled with the lack of recent documented sobriety. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of Appellant\u2019s acts, omissions, and \nmotivations. Each case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge and the PSAB \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines H, E, and J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nAppellant honorably served on active duty in the Air Force for almost ten years \nand achieved the rank of staff sergeant. Reference letters from two individuals who \nknew him well described his positive contributions to the Air Force, potential for future \nservice, and argued for leniency. However, using cocaine while granted access to \nclassified information constituted a breach of trust as well as a violation of the UCMJ \nthat the Air Force could not ignore. Applicant\u2019s choice to use drugs proved to be very \ncostly. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nApplicant has sought to rehabilitate himself. He participated in ADAPT while in \nthe Air Force and embraced the program. Since his discharge from the Air Force, he \nseems sincere in his efforts to turn the corner and put this past incident behind him. He \nis in a supportive environment, especially with his two older brothers serving as role \nmodels for him. However, what is lacking is additional time, but more important is \nevidence of sobriety. With that said, there is no reason Applicant cannot in the future \nrecover and regain eligibility for access to classified information in the future. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the security concerns \nraised. By failing to provide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking \nsufficient detail to fully establish mitigation, drug involvement and substance misuse \nconsiderations and criminal conduct security concerns remain. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 12968, DOD \nManual 5200.02, the AGs, and other cited references to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person. For the reasons stated, I conclude Appellant failed to \nmitigate security concerns under Guidelines H and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant again blames his misconduct on \n\u201cundiagnosed ADD and Anxiety.\u201d \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nApplicant solicited prostitutes for sexual intercourse in the Philippines in 2012, in \nPanama in 2015, in Alabama in 2017, and at an unspecified location in 2018. His conduct \nis criminal and represents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior that reflects a lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. It also creates a vulnerability to coercion or duress, as is apparent \nfrom his attempts to conceal it that are discussed below under Guideline E. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant is 30 years old. He has \nsolicited prostitutes on multiple occasions from 2012~2018. There is no evidence that \nfuture instances of this nature are unlikely to occur. He has not attended any counseling. \nSexual Behavior is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited\nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with\nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph\nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCAs, the following disqualifying \ncondition applies: \nAG \u00b6 16 (b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nemployer, investigator, security official . . . or other official government \nrepresentative. \nAG \u00b6 16 (d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination. . . . This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violation. \nApplicant failed to disclose his security violations in a timely fashion, and continued \nhis deceptions during security processing interviews in June and August of 2019. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused\nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with\nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of these apply. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct \nhis concealments. He also has demonstrated a pattern dishonesty and rule violations. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient information in this record to demonstrate that he has \nmet his burden of proof for his personal conduct. Personal Conduct is found against \nApplicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant solicited illegal prostitution from 2012~2018, in four locations, including \nat least two foreign countries, over a period of about six years. This evidence raises \nsecurity concerns under these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNone of these apply. Applicant repeatedly failed to report his fairly recent, illegal \nsexual misconduct. The evidence does not establish mitigation under any of the above \nconditions. Criminal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information (HPI) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information is set \nout in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 34. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; \n(e) copying or modifying protected information in an unauthorized manner \ndesigned to conceal or remove classification or other document control \nmarkings; and  \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn 2018, Applicant improperly brought home classified documents. In his Answer \nhe admits \u201cto burn the page that was marked \u2018Secret.\u2019\u201d In 2019, Applicant brought an \nunauthorized thumb drive inside his secure workplace. \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training \nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no evidence of \ncompromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct was proactive, and he tried to cover up \nhis misconduct by partially destroying a protected document. Handling protected \nInformation (HPI) is found against Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, E, J and K in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D, E, J and K, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his repeated sexual behavior, personal and criminal \nmisconduct, and mishandling of protected information. Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1 Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2 Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3 Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4 Guideline K (HPI): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a. and 4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nRichard A.

(Item \n3) \nIn June 2016, Applicant was employed as a summer intern for a company that had \nrandom drug testing. He was terminated the same month for testing positive for marijuana \non a random drug test. He explained that he had used marijuana several weeks prior to \nstarting the job. (Items 3, 5) \nIn October 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In it \nhe disclosed that from 2013 to October 2021, he occasionally used marijuana about once \nevery two months on average from 2013 to 2014; once every two weeks while attending \ncollege from 2014 to 2018, more frequently during the school year and less frequently \nduring the summer months; and once a month on average from 2020 to 2021.

One potential impact to \nmy employment responsibilities would be the successful obtainment of a \nFederal Security Clearance. In this case, I would refrain from using THC \nwhile in possession of the clearance.

It was not \nlegal in his state when he purchased it. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed on his SCA that he used hallucinogenic drugs five times. He \nused LSD twice in 2014 and once in 2020 and mushrooms once in 2017 and 2019. He \nstated he does not intend to use these drugs in the future because it does not appeal to \nhim and the risks of using them are too high.

(Item 3) \nIn December 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as \npart of his background investigation. He reported to the investigator that his last use of \nmarijuana was October 2021. He confirmed his previously disclosed cocaine and \nhallucinogenic drug use and frequency. He confirmed that he continues to have contact \nwith two of his friends with whom he used illegal drugs. He said he changed his mind \nabout using marijuana and other illegal drugs in the future, and he does not intend to use \nany illegal drugs in the future. He is focused on his future. He explained he used all of \nthese drugs for fun and recreation. (Item 5) \nIn June 2022, Applicant completed government interrogatories. He was transferred \nby his employer and moved to a new state in October 2021. Marijuana can be legally \nobtained in that state. He reported in his interrogatories that his last use of marijuana was \nNovember 2021 in the state where he had moved. This contradicts the date that he told \nthe government investigator that his last use was October 2021. He stated he decided to \nstop using marijuana. (Items 3, 4) He said: \nDecided to focus on career including security clearance application. \nDecided risk to career, reputation, legal action was not worth it. Additionally \ndecided to focus on physical health as an adult. (Item 4) \nApplicant stated he continues to associate with persons who use illegal substances \nand frequents places where he has reason to believe illegal substances are used or are \nused in his presence. He stated that this occurs about once every three months at \nconcerts and outdoor parks, but he typically does not find himself in these situations. He \nreported that when he had been in situations where illegal drugs were present, he \nremoved himself and made it clear he had made a decision not to use illegal drugs. (Item \n4) \nApplicant stated that he has changed his professional situation and joined a new \nteam at his job, which supports the military, and having a security clearance is desirable. \nHe said he applied for a security clearance in December 2021. His SCA was signed on \nOctober 22, 2021. (Items 3, 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana during a random drug test administered by \nhis employer in June 2016. Applicant possessed and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2013 to November 2021. From 2015 to September 2020, he \npossessed and used cocaine with varying frequency. From 2014 to 2020, he possessed \nand used LSD and mushrooms with varying frequency. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and mushrooms while in high school and \ncollege from 2013 to 2018. This perhaps can be attributed to a period of experimental \nand youthful indiscretion. However, he continued to use illegal drugs after he graduated \nfrom college in 2018 and was employed by a federal contractor. He initially intended to \ncontinue using marijuana unless he was granted a security clearance.

Applicant continues to associate with friends with whom he used illegal \ndrugs. After completing his SCA in October 2021, he disclosed in his June 2022 response \nto interrogatories that he was transferred by his employer to a new state, where marijuana \nis legal under state law, and he used it in November 2021. \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM with any additional evidence \nregarding his drug involvement or commitment to abstinence. Because Applicant chose \nto have his case decided without a hearing, I was unable to make a credibility \ndetermination of Applicant\u2019s sincerity and commitment to remain drug free. It is \nconcerning that after being fired by an employer in 2016 for testing positive for marijuana, \nand being put on notice that marijuana and other illegal drug use is incompatible with \ncertain employment, he continued to use it after being hired by a federal contractor. I also \nhave concerns that after clearly being put on notice about drug use when he completed \nhis SCA in October 2021, he used marijuana in November 2021. I find that Applicant\u2019s \nhandwritten disclosures in his interrogatories, which were sworn to in the state where he \nhad recently moved, noting the date and place of his last use, are more credible than the \nsummary of interview from the government investigator. There is insufficient evidence \nthat Applicant\u2019s conduct was infrequent, happened under unique circumstances, and is \nunlikely to recur. Without additional evidence, I find his illegal drugs use casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) and 25(b) do not \napply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination,\nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . .. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was fired from his job in 2016, while he was a summer intern, for testing \npositive for marijuana. The SOR alleges his termination for testing positive for marijuana \nunder the personal conduct guideline. I have previously addressed concerns under the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse guideline regarding his use and termination from \nhis job in 2016. I find that his termination from a job as a 20-year-old summer intern does \nnot rise to the level of making him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress or \nhaving the potential to affect his personal, professional, or community standing. I find the \nabove disqualifying condition does not apply and in Applicant\u2019s favor under this guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E, in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. I find the evidence \ndid not support the application of a disqualifying condition under Guideline E, personal \nconduct, and find in his favor. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.
