    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated October 30, 2007, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended a vocational school and college but did not obtain a degree. He remarried in 2001 after a divorce. He has one child from his previous marriage. He is current on his child support payments of about $960 per month.1 Applicant has several delinquent debts. He attributed his financial problems to him and his wife being laid off at the same time in about 2001. His employment was sporadic until he was hired by his current employer in 2005.2 The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling approximately $14,163. There is no evidence that any of the listed debts have been paid. Individual debts are discussed below. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a debt of $4,539 to a financial institution that was charged off in about February 2006. This is a debt for a credit card that was used mostly by Applicant\u2019s current wife. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a debt of $1,797 to another financial institution that was charged off in about July 2004. This is a debt for a credit card that Applicant used for a side business. Applicant\u2019s wife sold her house in about 2004. He stated that the debt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was supposed to be paid off as part of the closing on the sale of the house.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his history of not \nmeeting his financial obligations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 30, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on December 3, \n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 14, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on January 30, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthrough 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf \nand submitted Exhibit (AE) A, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 7, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 30, 2007, Applicant admitted all the \nfactual allegations in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended a \nvocational school and college but did not obtain a degree. He remarried in 2001 after a \ndivorce. He has one child from his previous marriage. He is current on his child support \npayments of about $960 per month.1  \n \n \nApplicant has several delinquent debts. He attributed his financial problems to \nhim and his wife being laid off at the same time in about 2001. His employment was \nsporadic until he was hired by his current employer in 2005.2 The SOR alleges three \ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $14,163. There is no evidence that any of the \nlisted debts have been paid. Individual debts are discussed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a debt of $4,539 to a financial institution that was charged off \nin about February 2006. This is a debt for a credit card that was used mostly by \nApplicant\u2019s current wife. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a debt of $1,797 to another financial \ninstitution that was charged off in about July 2004. This is a debt for a credit card that \nApplicant used for a side business. Applicant\u2019s wife sold her house in about 2004. He \nstated that the debt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was supposed to be paid off as part of the \nclosing on the sale of the house. According to Applicant, the debt was listed on the \ndocuments that estimated the closing costs, but was not listed on the actual closing \ndocuments. Applicant stated he did not notice that it was not paid until his debts \nbecame an issue for his security clearance. He just forgot about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nIn his response to Interrogatories dated September 13, 2007, he stated that the debts \nwere transferred to collection agencies, but that one agency had not yet received their \ndebt and the other agency had not returned his calls. Applicant also stated that he and \nhis wife were refinancing the two mortgages on their house and they would repay the \ntwo debts in the process. The house was refinanced in about November 2007, but it \nwas just changed from an adjustable rate to a fixed rate mortgage and no equity was \npulled out. Applicant testified that he finally received a letter from one company, and he \nplans on starting to make payments on both accounts.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 54-55; GE 1-2. \n \n2 Tr. at 14, 20, 30-35; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 17-19, 29, 41-46, 53-54; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b of $7,827 to a credit card company was charged off in \nabout September 2004. Applicant stated that this was an old account that he had with \nhis ex-wife. The balance was about $1,000 before she used the card to pay for her \nwedding to her new husband. He stated that he closed the account and she promised to \npay the balance, but after a few payments, she stopped paying on the account. \nApplicant does not intend to pay this debt since most of it was from his ex-wife\u2019s \nwedding to her new husband.4 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he needs to get better on his finances, and that it was \nforgetfulness more than an intentional design that caused him to disregard his debts. \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s current mortgage payments are locked in at a fixed rate totaling \nabout $4,500 per month. They also have real estate tax payments of about $5,890 \nevery six months. They use assets in a retirement account to pay the real estate taxes. \nHe and his wife have car expenses of about $1,650 per month. He drives an upscale \ncar that he bought in 2005 for about $32,000. Applicant had a truck with low gas \nmileage and a large payment. He felt it was better financially to trade to a car. His wife \ndrives a leased luxury car.5 \n \n \nApplicant obtained a part-time job and rented a room in his house for about $600 \nper month in an attempt to better his finances. He makes about $57,000 per year \nthrough his full-time job and his wife earns about $100,000 per year. He testified that if it \nwas necessary for him to obtain a clearance, that he could pay his delinquent debts with \nmoney from his retirement account, but that it would incur a tax consequence. \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement, submitted with his response to Interrogatories, \nshows assets of $57,000 in retirement accounts. It shows a remainder of $5 after his \nmonthly expenses and mortgage. It does not reflect the additional income generated by \nhis part-time job and his renter. It also does not reflect the real estate tax payments of \nabout $5,890 which are due every six months. Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling.6  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 15-16, 28-29; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 15-16, 21-28, 51; GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 19 36, 46, 51; GE 2; AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n5 \n \n \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant accumulated several delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling to \npay his obligations for a period of time. Applicant has what amounts to a negative cash \nflow. His monthly expenses are greater than his monthly income. His personal financial \nstatement reflects a $5 remainder every month. It does not reflect the additional income \ngenerated by his renter and part-time job, but it also does not reflect the $5,890 in real \nestate taxes due every six months. It also does not leave any excess to pay the debts \nalleged in the SOR. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant currently has delinquent debt totaling more than $14,000. He and his \nwife were both unemployed in 2001, causing financial problems. That constitutes \nconditions that were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. He has done nothing to pay the \ndebts since they both started working again. That is not acting responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He states he will start paying at least some of the debts but has done \nnothing to show that he will follow up on those statements. He will not pay the one \naccount because he believes his ex-wife should be responsible for the debt. However, \nthe credit card was in both their names, and the company was fully justified in looking to \nApplicant for payment. Applicant has not received financial counseling. There are not \nclear indications the financial problem is being resolved or is under control. His overall \nconduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude \nno mitigating condition is fully applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant and his wife were both \nunemployed in 2001. However, they have been employed continuously since at least \n2005, and he has done nothing to pay his debts. Applicant admitted that he is forgetful \nwhen it comes to his finances. Applicant and his wife like many couples in today\u2019s \nmarket, particularly those in high cost areas, spend a good chunk of their disposable \nincome on their house. That in itself is not a bad thing, as they have to live somewhere \nand a house can also serve as an investment. They also drive and pay for expensive \ncars while Applicant is neglecting his delinquent debts. That is not acting financially \nresponsible. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEDWARD W.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBruce B. Elfvin, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 31, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant, who acted pro se at the\nhearing, was denied due process; whether the Judge erred in her application of the pertinent\nGuideline E mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.1\nFinding no error, we affirm the decision of the Judge.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a former Air Force\nmember who is currently employed by a federal contractor.  He \u201chas a history of arrests, many of\nwhich involved alcohol.\u201d  Decision at 2.  In 1981, 1985, 1987, and 1998 he was arrested and charged\nwith Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  In 1987, he was arrested and charged with\nfailure to control his vehicle, following an automobile accident.  Additionally, in 1998 he was\narrested and charged with misdemeanor fraud for writing bad checks.  In 1987 and again in 1997\nApplicant received inpatient treatment for alcohol dependence.  He has experienced financial\nproblems, which have resulted, among other things, in vehicle repossessions, a garnishment for child\nsupport payments, and a discharge in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  In 1995, and again in 2007, Applicant\nfilled out security clearance applications (SCA).  Applicant did not provide truthful answers to\nquestions concerning his criminal history, his alcohol dependence treatment, his bankruptcy, his\nwage garnishment, and his vehicle repossessions.\nThe Board has considered the issues which Applicant has raised on appeal.  Concerning\nApplicant\u2019s claim that his due process rights were compromised by his self-representation, the record\ndemonstrates that Applicant received detailed pre-hearing guidance from DOHA explaining his\nrights.  Among other things, he was advised of his right to employ counsel, or to have some other\nperson represent him at the hearing; his right to present evidence and witnesses; his right to cross\nexamine witnesses against him; and his right to object to evidence.  A review of the entire record\ndiscloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under the Directive or\nthat he had not been adequately advised of those rights.  See Tr. at 4-6.  \u201cHaving decided to represent\nhimself during the proceedings below, Applicant cannot fairly complain about the quality of his self-\n\nSee, e.g., Government Exhibit 10, Statement of Subject, dated September14, 1996, in which Applicant\n2\nattributed false statements on the 1995 SCA to having been advised by an unnamed person \u201cthat the information wouldn\u2019t\nbe checked thoroughly.\u201d  \nSee, e.g., Decision at 13-14:  \u201cDespite several questions that sought adverse background information, he did\n3\nnot disclose any information about his criminal history, alcohol treatment, or financial problems.  He excused his\nomissions by claiming all incidents fell outside a seven-year time period that he was told applied . . . [H]e maintained\nthat position, despite specific questions that used the word \u201cever\u201d and did not mention seven years as a cut-off period\n. . . His explanations for omitting information are neither credible nor persuasive . . . His explanations for his omissions\nare disingenuous and unbelievable.  He knew or should have known (having gone through the same process ten years\nearlier) that the Government was seeking all adverse information in his history.\u201d  \n3\nrepresentation or seek to be relieved of the consequences of his decision to represent himself.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  \nTo the extent that the remaining issues include a challenge to the factual sufficiency of the\nGuideline E security concerns, the record demonstrates that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were based upon\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) The Judge reasonably explained her conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s answers to the questions at issue were deliberately false: e.g., that the questions were\nclear in their meaning, that his testimony was evasive, and that he had made prior statements\ninconsistent with his claim of innocent mistake.   Decision at 12.  Furthermore, the record\n2\ndemonstrates that the Judge considered appropriate mitigating conditions, holding in favor of\nApplicant as to the Guideline F security concerns and two of the factual allegations under Guideline\nE.  However, she concluded that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to the\nremaining Guideline E allegations.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Viewed in light of the record as a\nwhole, this conclusion is sustainable.  The Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is also sustainable.   See\n3\nISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

He \u201chas a history of arrests, many of which involved alcohol.\u201d Decision at 2. In 1981, 1985, 1987, and 1998 he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). In 1987, he was arrested and charged with failure to control his vehicle, following an automobile accident. Additionally, in 1998 he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor fraud for writing bad checks. In 1987 and again in 1997 Applicant received inpatient treatment for alcohol dependence. He has experienced financial problems, which have resulted, among other things, in vehicle repossessions, a garnishment for child support payments, and a discharge in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In 1995, and again in 2007, Applicant filled out security clearance applications (SCA). Applicant did not provide truthful answers to questions concerning his criminal history, his alcohol dependence treatment, his bankruptcy, his wage garnishment, and his vehicle repossessions. The Board has considered the issues which Applicant has raised on appeal. Concerning Applicant\u2019s claim that his due process rights were compromised by his self-representation, the record demonstrates that Applicant received detailed pre-hearing guidance from DOHA explaining his rights. Among other things, he was advised of his right to employ counsel, or to have some other person represent him at the hearing; his right to present evidence and witnesses; his right to cross examine witnesses against him; and his right to object to evidence. A review of the entire record discloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under the Directive or that he had not been adequately advised of those rights.

On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 31, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 21, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On April 9, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to \nme and issued a Notice of Hearing on May 7, 2008. The case was heard on May 29, \n2008, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 16 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through H \ninto evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil June 13, 2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On \nJune 12, 2008, Applicant submitted 15 additional exhibits that were marked AE I \nthrough W, and admitted into the record without objection by the Government. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 11, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \nParagraph 1 of the SOR, except \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.l and 1.m. He denied the falsifications \nallegations contained in Paragraph 2 and offered explanations in support of his position. \nThose admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and has been married to his second wife for 19 years. \nHe has three children with her, ages 18, 14 and 8, and one from his prior marriage, age \n31. He enlisted in the Air Force in May 1973 and worked as a firefighter. He was \nhonorably discharged in October 1980. After leaving military service, he joined a federal \nagency as a firefighter. In August 1985, he began working as a dispatcher/security \nofficer for his current employer, a federal contractor. He has worked for the federal \ngovernment for 30 years and held a security clearance for most of that time, beginning \nwith his time in the Air Force. (Tr. 73). Over the course of his employment, he has \nsubmitted at least two applications for a security clearance: one in October 1995 and \none in March 2007.   \n \n \nApplicant has a history of arrests, many of which involved alcohol. In August \n1979, he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). In June \n1981, he was arrested and charged with a DUI. In July 1985, he was arrested and \ncharged with Driving While Intoxicated. In June 1987, he was arrested and charged with \nFailure to Control, after being involved in an automobile accident. In August 1987, he \nwas arrested and charged with a DUI. In March 1988, he was arrested and charged with \nMisdemeanor Fraud for Writing Bad Checks. In February 1998, he was arrested and \ncharged with a DUI. \n \n \nIn November 1987, Applicant was admitted to a veteran\u2019s hospital where he was \ndiagnosed and treated for alcohol dependence. In 1997, he again received in-patient \ntreatment for alcohol dependence. He has not consumed alcohol for 11 years. (Tr. 38). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties since the 1980\u2019s. Those difficulties \ninclude vehicle repossessions in 1986, 2005 and 2006, a garnishment for child support \n\n \n \n \n \n3\npayments from 1985-1989, numerous delinquent debts, some of which were charged \noff, judgments entered in July 1999 and November 2002, and a tax lien filed in 2007. \n(Tr. 74; Answer). \n \n \n In September 2004, Applicant and his wife filed a petition for a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy that was granted in January 2005, discharging approximately $66,644 in \nunsecured debts, including a $49,000 student loan.1 (GE 16). After the bankruptcy his \nfinancial problems continued, some of which resulted because he paid his mother\u2019s \nliving expenses before she died. (Tr. 37, 139, 141). In February 2006, he entered into a \ncredit counseling agreement to manage the bills he accrued. In August 2007, he \nencountered problems with the company handling his debts and terminated the \nagreement. (Tr. 118; GE 3 at 122). On June 11, 2008, he executed another debt \nrepayment plan that anticipates resolving all of his delinquent debts within 41 months. \nThe amount included in the plan is $14,127. (AE U & V). \n \n \n The SOR alleged that Applicant has failed to pay 12 delinquent debts, totaling \n$34,537. The status of those debts is as follows: \n \n1. Three debts are paid: \u00b6 1. b for $155 (AE E); \u00b6 1.c for $656 and \u00b6 1.d $768 \nare duplicates (AE A); and \u00b6 1.k for $477 (AE D). \n \n2. The mortgage listed in \u00b6 1.i for $5,985 has been refinanced and is current. \n(AE C). \n \n3. Two debts were discharged in the 2005 bankruptcy order: \u00b6 1.e for $601 and \n\u00b6 1.j for $3,693. (GX 16). \n \n4. One debt is being disputed through litigation: \u00b6 1.f for $12,212. (Tr. 43, 82; AE \nB). \n \n5. Two debts were included in the 2006 repayment plan: \u00b6 1.g for $1,056 and \u00b6 \n1.h for $4,570. (Tr. 44, 83). The debts were recently incorporated into the \nrepayment plan executed in June 2008. (AE U & V). \n \n6. Two debts are unresolved: \u00b6 1.l for $50 that he intends to pay and \u00b6 1.m for \n$3,314 that may be his deceased mother\u2019s debt. He is attempting to resolve \nboth. (Tr. 85-86). \n \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant submitted a budget that is current today. (Tr. 120). He \nand his spouse have a net monthly income of about $4,500 and expenses of $1,724, \nleaving a $1,400 remainder, although that may be less because of some additional \nexpenses. (GE 3 at 117; Tr. 120). He acknowledges his history of financial difficulties, \nbut believes his financial position has improved. (Tr. 144). He does not use credit cards \n                                            \n1Five years prior to this bankruptcy, Applicant\u2019s wife filed bankruptcy. (Tr. 77).  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nand is current on all of his obligations. (Tr. 121-122). In summary, all of the alleged \ndebts are resolved, except two that total $3,364. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleged in Paragraph 2 that Applicant falsified information submitted to \nthe Government in eleven separate instances (\u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.k). Applicant denied all of \nthose allegations. \n \n \n In October 1995, Applicant completed a National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) \nand obtained a Secret security clearance in 1996. In a heading box, at the top of page 3 \nof the NAQ, the form advises that \u201cAnswers to questions in Items 18 through 22 are \nNOT limited to the 5, 10 or 15 years, but pertain to your entire life. (See DETAILED \nInstructions.)\u201d  \n \n \nQuestion 18 of the NAQ asked: \u201cArrests: a) Have you ever been arrested, \ncharged, cited, held, or detained by a Federal, State, or other law enforcement or \njuvenile authorities regardless of whether the charge was dropped or dismissed or you \nwere found not guilty?\u201d In response to that question, Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did \nnot disclose the arrests and charges from August 1979, June 1981, July 1985, June \n1987, August 1987, and March 1988. (GE 14). Applicant testified that he thought the \nquestion was limited to the past seven years. (Tr. 66). ) (SOR \u00b6 2.h)2 \n \n \nQuestion 19 on the NAQ pertains to one\u2019s credit history. Question 19(b) inquired, \n\u201cHave you ever had your wages garnished or anything repossessed?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose a 1986 automobile repossession or a garnishment \nof his wages for child support that was effective from 1985 to 1989. (SOR \u00b6 2.i) \n \n \n \nQuestion 19(d) asked, \u201cDo you have any judgments against you which have not \nbeen paid?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose a tax judgment for $477 that \nwas entered in October 1993 and not satisfied until June 1999. (GE 14). He did not \nhave any clear recollection of the reason he did not disclose the requested information. \n(Tr. 67-70). (SOR \u00b6 2.j) \n \n \nQuestion 20(d) on the NAQ inquired about \u201cDrug/Alcohol Use and Mental Health: \nHas your use of alcohol beverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) ever resulted in the loss \nof a job, disciplinary action, arrest by police, or any alcohol-related treatment or \ncounseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism).\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did \nnot disclose the 1979, 1981, 1985, and two 1987 arrests, all of which involved alcohol, \nnor the 1987 hospital admission and treatment for alcohol abuse. (GE 14). (SOR \u00b6 2.k) \n \n \n \nIn September 1996, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about his \nanswers on the NAQ. During the interview, Applicant disclosed the June 1987 arrest, \n                                            \n2The allegations in this Decision are referenced by chronology and not by their sequence in the \nSOR.    \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nthe March 1988 arrest. He did not mention the 1985 or August 1987 arrests. He also \ntold the investigator he spent 30 days in alcohol rehabilitation. He acknowledged that he \nhad a car repossessed in 1986 and that a $480 judgment was entered against him for \noutstanding state taxes. (GE 10). \n \n \nThe investigator asked Applicant the reason he did not disclose the above \ninformation on the NAQ. In a written statement, Applicant noted, \u201cConcerning the \nreason I failed to answer yes to questions on my paperwork (NAQ) dated 3 Nov 95 \nregarding arrests, garnishments, repossessions, tax lien, use of alcohol, was due to the \nfact that someone, who is no longer a NASA employee, who I don\u2019t want to reveal his \nname, told me that the information wouldn\u2019t be checked thoroughly.\u201d (GE 10). During his \ntestimony, he could not clearly recall the interview. He did not write the statement, but \nadmitted that he signed it and initialed three pages of it. (Tr. 110-111). \n \n \nIn a follow-up November 1996 interview, Applicant disclosed additional \ninformation about his financial delinquencies and the 1987 DUI. He did not disclose that \ninformation during the September interview because he had forgotten about it. (GE 11). \n \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant completed another security clearance application, an e-\nQIP. He asserted that he never read the e-QIP, but instead completed it with the \nassistance of someone in his employer\u2019s security office, who read the questions to him \nand inserted his answers into the computer per his instruction. That person allegedly \ntold him that he was only required to disclose information within the past seven years for \nall questions. (Tr. 56-57; 114-115). He claimed he did not have an opportunity to review \nthe document before signing and submitting it. (Tr. 118). \n \n \nSection 23 of the e-QIP requested information pertaining to one\u2019s criminal \nhistory. It stated: \u201cYour Police Record: For this item, report information regardless of \nwhether the record in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the court \nrecord. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the \nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order \nunder the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d Question 23(d) specifically \nasked: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to \nalcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose his five alcohol-related \narrests and charges, including the 1998 incident, because they were outside the seven-\nyear time period. (Tr. 89). (SOR \u00b6 2.c) \n \n \nSection 27 of the e-QIP posed questions related to \u201cYour Financial Record.\u201d \nQuestion 27(a) asked: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any chapter of \nthe bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not \ndisclose his 2004 bankruptcy because he did not remember the date. He said he made \na mistake and should have included it. (Tr. 116-118; GE 1 at 26). (SOR \u00b6 2.d) \n \n \nQuestion 27(b) asked: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished \nor had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not \ndisclose his 2005 and 2006 automobile repossessions. (GE 1 at 27). He believed the \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n2005 was not reportable because he voluntarily surrendered the automobile, although \nhe learned that the bank considered it a repossession before he completed the e-QIP. \n(Tr. 59-60). He is litigating the 2006 repossession and did not believe it was reportable. \n(Tr. 61). (SOR \u00b6 2.e) \n \n \nQuestion 27(d) asked: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against \nyou that have not been paid?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose the \nNovember 2002 judgment for $3,693. (GE 1 at 27).  He did not mention that judgment \nbecause it was discharged in the 2004-2005 bankruptcy. (Tr. 58-61). (SOR \u00b6 2.f) \n \n \nSection 28 of the e-QIP raised questions regarding \u201cYour Financial \nDelinquencies.\u201d Question 28(a) asked: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 \ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant failed to disclose eight delinquent debts listed in \nthe SOR, and a charged off account. He thought he was not required to disclose any of \nthe debts because they were being paid through a repayment plan and not delinquent. \n(Tr. 64). (SOR \u00b6 2.g) \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories Concerning Alcohol \nConsumption and Finances, in follow-up to his March 2007 e-QIP. Question 2 asked: \n\u201cHave you ever received any medical treatment, counseling or supportive treatment \nfrom a drug or alcoholic rehabilitation center or other organization due to the use of \nalcohol?\u201d Applicant disclosed the 1997 hospitalization and treatment for alcohol \ndependence, but not the 1987 hospitalization. His probation officer helped him complete \nthe Interrogatories. He did not include the 1987 treatment because it was more than \nseven years old. (Tr. 55; 91). (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \n \n \nQuestion 5 of that set of Interrogatories asked: \u201cHave you ever been arrested, \ncharged or held by any law enforcement authorities for any reason?\u201d Applicant \ndisclosed the 1998 arrest, but not the 1979, 1981, 1985, 1988, or two 1987 arrests \nbecause they were outside the seven-year time period. (Tr. 53). (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \n \n \nQuestion 9 of that set of Interrogatories further asked: \u201cOn your security \nclearance application you answered no to the following questions. Please indicate why \nyou answered the way you did.\u201d The questions related to the 2004 bankruptcy, an \nunpaid judgment, debts delinquent more than 180 and 90 days, and all alcohol related \nincidents. The Applicant answered that he did not disclose the 2004 bankruptcy \nbecause he did not remember that it was filed in 2004 and discharged in 2005. He did \nnot disclose the tax judgment because he paid it. He did not mention the financial \naccounts over 90 and 180 days delinquent because they were being paid by a credit \ncounseling company. He admitted he had been charged with an alcohol-related incident \nin 1998, but did not disclose all of the previous incidents because they were \u201cnot within \n7 years.\u201d (GE 3 at 114).  \n \n \n Applicant submitted four letters of recommendation from colleagues, who have \nknown and worked with him over the years. His project manager considers him to be a \nvalued member of the security team. (AE I). The emergency management coordinator \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nstated that Applicant is \u201creliable, trustworthy, and dependable.\u201d (AE J).  The captain of \nsecurity for the company praised Applicant as \u201cone of the most knowledgeable, \ndependable and professional people [he] has ever worked with.\u201d (AE K). A special agent \nfor the security management and safeguards office has known Applicant for 11 years \nand has no reservations in recommending him for a security clearance. (AE L). Over the \npast couple years he received various awards and special training. (AE M, N, O, Q and \nR). In October 2007, he received a certificate for completing a course in security office \nfundamentals. (AE P).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n \n \n \n8\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns, two of \nwhich are potentially applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant \nhas experienced financial problems since the 1980\u2019s, resulting in a significant amount of \ndelinquent debt that he has been unable to manage or pay. Those difficulties continue \ninto the present, despite having discharged a large amount of debt through a \nbankruptcy in 2005. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove  \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial difficulties started in the 1980s and continue into mid-2008. \nBecause the problems have been ongoing for many years and subsequent to a \ndischarge of a significant amount of debt in a 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, AG \u00b6 20(a) \ncannot apply. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s debts accrued subsequent to the 2005 bankruptcy because \nhe provided support for his ill mother and could not pay both his bills and his mother\u2019s \nbills. Those circumstances were outside of his control. Subsequently, he attempted to \nmanage his debts through a debt reduction program that he executed in 2006. I find AG \n\u00b6 20(b) has some application.  \n \nApplicant resolved $31,173 of the $34,537 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \nthrough payments, repayment plans, dispute process, or discharge in bankruptcy. He \nintends to resolve the remaining two debts. According to his budget and testimony, he is \nmanaging his financial obligations and not incurring additional ones. The evidence \nsupports the partial application of AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d), as his financial problems \nare under control through his good-faith efforts to resolve or pay his delinquent debts. \nBecause resolution of those debts has occurred only recently and he has not \nestablished a sufficient track record of fiscal responsibility to offset his long history of \nfinancial mismanagement, full application of these mitigating conditions is not \nwarranted. \n \nApplicant presented sufficient evidence to prove that he has disputed through \nlitigation one of the larger debts related to an automobile repossession, and to trigger \nthe application of AG \u00b6 20(e). There is no record evidence to support the application of \nAG \u00b6 20(f). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to the guideline for Personal \nConduct: \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe Government alleged in Paragraph 2 that Applicant falsified material facts in \neleven separate instances during the security clearance process, constituting a potential \ndisqualification under this guideline. AG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could \nraise a security concern, one of which may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant denied all eleven allegations. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not \nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state \nof mind at the time the omission occurred. (ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. \nBd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \nBased on the evidence, the Government established a disqualification for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.h, 2.i, 2.j. and 2.k. It did not establish a \ndisqualification for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that Applicant disclosed a 1998 arrest on his Response \nto the October 2007 Interrogatories, but deliberately failed to disclose six other \narrests. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleged that he disclosed treatment for alcoholism in 1997 on \nsaid Response, but deliberately failed to disclose in-patient treatment for alcohol \ndependence in 1987. Applicant asserted that he was told that he was only \nrequired to disclose information that occurred within the past seven years of the \ntime he completed the form. I do not find his explanation credible for two \nreasons. First, the set of Interrogatories was mailed to him after he completed the \nMarch 2007 e-QIP and clearly alerted him to the fact that the Government was \nnot satisfied with his e-QIP answers on these two subjects. Second, both \nquestions begin with the words, \u201cHave you ever been\u201d and do not mention a time \nframe. (Emphasis added) Third, he disclosed the 1998 arrest and 1997 \ntreatment, both of which were outside the seven-year window that he claimed he \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nrelied on while answering the questions. I find that the Government established \nthe above disqualification. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the March 2007 e-\nQIP because he failed to disclose five arrests and charges. I do not find his \nexplanation that he relied on the interpretation of someone from his office \ncredible. That question clearly states \u201cHave you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs.\u201d Anyone one reading it aloud \nshould have noted the \u201cever\u201d qualifier and Applicant had an obligation to verify \nthe accuracy of his answers. I find that the Government established the above \ndisqualification. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the e-QIP because \nhe failed to disclose the 2004-2005 bankruptcy. Applicant claimed he made a \nmistake. I do not find his defense credible because in response to SOR \u00b6 1.e and \n1.j he denied owing the debts that were discharged in a bankruptcy, which he \nclaims he forgot. Furthermore, the bankruptcy occurred approximately two years \nprior to his completion of the e-QIP, and well within his seven-year defense. I find \nthat the Government established the above disqualification. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the e-QIP because \nhe failed to disclose a 2005 and 2006 automobile repossession. That question \nreferenced a seven-year time frame. Applicant did not disclose either \nrepossession because he voluntarily surrendered both vehicles and did not \nconsider them repossessions. However, he admitted that after he surrendered \nthe automobiles, he learned, prior to completing the e-QIP, that the banks \nconsidered the actions to be repossessions, and yet failed to disclose the \ninformation. I find that the Government established the above disqualification.  \nSOR \u00b6 2.f alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the e-QIP because \nhe failed to disclose an unpaid judgment that had been entered within the past \nseven years. Applicant presented proof that the judgment had been satisfied, \nprior to completing the e-QIP, and thus, he was not required to disclose it. This \nallegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR \u00b6 2.g alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the e-QIP because \nhe failed to disclose specific debts that were more than 180 days delinquent. \nApplicant provided evidence that the debts were either paid, in a repayment plan \nor discharged in bankruptcy. His explanation on this matter is credible. This \nallegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h through 2.k alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified the \nSeptember 1995 NAQ. SOR \u00b6 2.h alleged that he failed to disclose six previous \narrests. SOR \u00b6 2.i alleged that he failed to disclose a 1986 vehicle repossession \nand a 1985-1989 garnishment. SOR \u00b6 2.j alleged that he failed to disclose an \nunpaid 1993 judgment. SOR \u00b6 2.k alleged that he failed to four alcohol-related \n\n \n \n \n \n12\narrests and charges, and a 1987 hospital admission and treatment for alcohol \ndependence. Prefacing all of these questions was language clearing stating that \nno time limit applied to an applicant\u2019s answers. When confronted about his \nomissions in September 1996, Applicant told a government investigator that he \nfailed to disclose the requested information because he believed the government \nwould not check his history thoroughly. During his testimony, he did not \nacknowledge or affirm that answer, and instead had some difficulty remembering \nthe interview and evaded answering questions about it. I find that his September \n1996 signed statement is credible evidence and that he deliberately falsified the \n1995 NAQ.   \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nraised under this guideline. I considered four of them as potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and, \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nAlthough Applicant admitted all of the facts underlying the SOR allegations, he \nnever made any effort to correct his omissions until he was confronted with the facts \nduring both clearance processes. Hence, AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Applicant \nattributed his failure to disclose information to conversations he had with a person, who \nassisted him in filling out the e-QIP and Interrogatories. However, he did not produce \nany evidence, other than his testimony, to substantiate his assertions that some person \ntold him to answer every question within a seven-year time limitation. Said evidence is \nnecessary for the application of AG \u00b6 17(b). Because the falsification offenses are not \nminor and occurred in 1995 and again in 2007, they cast doubt on his trustworthiness \nand good judgment, and prevent the application of AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant never \nacknowledged that he intentionally withheld information from the government, thus, AG \n\u00b6 17(d) is not applicable. \n\n \n \n \n \n13\n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 53-year-old man, who \nserved his country for seven years in the Air Force and was honorably discharged.  \nAfter leaving military service, he continued working for the federal government for 30 \nyears and has held a security clearance for most of that time. His colleagues and \nsupervisors are impressed with his work. He recognizes his long history of financial \nproblems and appears to be committed to making progress in that area. All of these \nfactors, in addition to the mitigating conditions that have application, lead me to \nconclude that he mitigated the security concerns raised under the Financial \nConsiderations guideline.  \n \nHowever, those factors are not sufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s history of non-\ndisclosure of adverse information over the years. In October 1995, he completed a NAQ \nand did not include one negative incident from his past. In September 1996, he truthfully \nadmitted, during an interview that the reason that he did not disclose his arrests and \ncharges, financial problems, and alcohol treatment was his belief that the government \nwould not uncover the negative information. Two months later, he was again \ninterviewed about other information he left off the NAQ. In March 2007, he submitted \nanother application for a security clearance (e-QIP). Despite several questions that \nsought adverse background information, he did not disclose any information about his \ncriminal history, alcohol treatment, or financial problems. He excused his omissions by \nclaiming all incidents fell outside a seven-year time period that he was told applied. In \nhis response to October 2007 Interrogatories, he maintained that position, despite \nspecific questions that used the word \u201cever\u201d and did not mention seven years as a cut-\noff period. In two responses to the Interrogatories, he disclosed information that was \n\n \n \n \n \n14\noutside the seven-year requirement, which he consistently asserted as his defense. His \nexplanations for omitting information are neither credible nor persuasive. Applicant has \nconsistently shown a pattern of deception and intentional omissions of relevant \ninformation requested by the Government to make a security clearance determination. \nHis explanations for his omissions are disingenuous and unbelievable. He knew or \nshould have known (having gone through the same process ten years earlier) that the \nGovernment was seeking all adverse information in his history. I find his decisions to \nintentionally withhold information a serious security concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence pertaining to personal conduct leaves substantial \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor the reasons stated above, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising under financial considerations, but not those arising under personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.f and 2.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.h through 2.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn, October 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial considerations, Guideline J, criminal conduct, Guideline E,\npersonal conduct, and Guideline G, alcohol consumption security concerns. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 8, 2007. He did not specifically\nanswer each allegation, nor did he state whether he sought a hearing or an\nadministrative determination. Later, he submitted an undated, supplementary answer\nwith responses to each individual allegation, and a request for an administrative\ndetermination. On January 21, 2008, department counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nJune 23, 2008\n\n2\nMaterial (FORM). Applicant received it on January 23, 2008, and did not reply. The case\nwas assigned to me on May 27, 2008. I have reviewed the FORM, and have concluded\nthat eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural Ruling\nDepartment Counsel filed a motion to amend the SOR by withdrawing\nsubparagraphs 2.g, 2.k, and 2.l, and amending subparagraphs 2.m, 3.a, and 4.a. I\ngranted the motion. The amended subparagraphs read, as follows:\n2.m.  On or about April 22, 1997, you were arrested in City X and charged\nwith Drinking in Public. You were found guilty and fined $76.\n3.a.  That information as set forth in subparagraphs 2.a, 2.f, and 2.m,\nabove.\n4.a.  That information as set forth in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.f, 2.h through\n2.j, and 2.m through 2.q, above.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old single man. Although the record evidence indicates he\npays \u201cchild support/daycare\u201d expenses, (See Item 9 at 6) the number of children he has\nis unclear, because he did not list any on his security clearance application. He earned\nan electronics degree from a technical school in 1988. Since 2005, he has worked for a\ndefense contractor as an electronics technician. \nApplicant has approximately $11,900 of delinquent debt, as listed in SOR\nParagraph 1. He owes approximately $11,200 to credit card companies or banks. The\nremainder are either medical or utility bills. According to a 2007 budget, he has $825 of\nmonthly after-expense income, and $5,000 in savings (Item 9 at 6).\nApplicant admitted all of the delinquencies except SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b,\n1.f, 1.g, and 1.i. He provided no evidence that he has either made payment\narrangements or satisfied the admitted delinquencies, nor has he provided evidence\nthat he has either satisfied or disputed the controverted debts with the respective\ncreditors. \nIn November 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.\nThe charges were later dropped (Item 10 at 2).\nIn November 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with simple assault and\ncarrying/displaying a firearm. He was found guilty of the assault charge and ordered to\npay a fine (Item 10 at 2).\n\n3\nIn September 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with speeding. He was\nfound guilty and ordered to pay a fine (Item 15).\nIn April 1997, Applicant was charged with drinking in public. He was found guilty\nand fined $76 (Item 18).\nIn August 2000, Applicant was charged with careless operation of a motor\nvehicle. He was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine (Item 5).\nIn September 2001, Applicant was found guilty of speeding. Later, he was\nordered to pay a fine (Items 5, 13).\nIn September 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with careless operation\nof an automobile, and driving with an open container of beer in a motor vehicle. The\ncourt dismissed the careless operation charge, and he was found guilty of the alcohol-\nrelated charge (Items 5, 19).\nIn March 2004, Applicant was charged driving with an expired vehicle license,\nand no proof of insurance. He was found guilty, and sentenced to one day in jail,\nsuspended (Item 12).\nIn December 2004, Applicant was cited and charged with careless operation of\nan automobile. He was found not guilty (Item 5).\nIn July 2005, Applicant was charged with speeding. He was found guilty and\nfined (Item 5).\nIn June 2007, he was charged with speeding and possessing an open container\nof alcohol. He was fined (Item 5).\nIn July 2007, he was stopped, and charged with speeding. He was found guilty\nand fined (Item 5).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\n\n4\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income\nratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nI have considered the mitigating conditions, and concluded none apply. Despite\nhaving $825 of monthly after-expense income, and $5,000 in savings, Applicant has not\nprovided any evidence that he has resolved his delinquent accounts. Similarly, he has\ntaken no steps to contact the creditors of the disputed delinquencies. I conclude he has\nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d Here, Applicant has an extensive history of criminal\ninfractions. He has been charged twice for criminal offenses the past year. AG  \u00b6 31(a),\n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d applies.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Although\nthe majority of the infractions were minor, automobile-related misdemeanors, and some\nwere either dropped or resulted in not guilty findings, their repetitive nature raises\nserious questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, and his willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations. Moreover, he has offered no evidence of remorse, reform, or\nrehabilitation. Applicant has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security concern.\n\n5\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThree of Applicant\u2019s 13 arrests were, in part, alcohol-related. AG 21(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d applies.\nThe alcohol-related charges were minor and occurred over an 11-year period.\nThere is no record evidence that they resulted in either any court-ordered alcohol\nevaluations, or any court orders to attend state-sponsored classes regarding\nresponsible alcohol use. AG 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption concern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Although none of the disqualifying conditions explicitly apply,\nApplicant\u2019s conduct clearly involves questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations. For the same reasons set forth in the criminal conduct\nsection above, Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct\nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a), as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s extensive history of criminal and civil infractions, and his ongoing\nfinancial problems render him an unacceptable candidate for a security clearance. In\nreaching this decision, I have considered the whole person factors, particularly, its\nfrequency and recency, the absence of rehabilitation, and the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. Clearance is denied.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a- 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraph 2.h - 2.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.k - 2.l:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraph 2.m - 2.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Marine, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 8, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 18, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 17, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on June 24, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born and raised in Romania. In 1988, she moved to the United\nStates with her parents and two brothers. Applicant, along with her father and brothers,\nbecame United States citizens in 1996. Apparently her mother did not. They all live in\nthe United States.\nApplicant married a Romanian citizen in Romania in 2007. She has filed the\npaperwork to sponsor her husband\u2019s admission into the United States, but to date no\naction has been taken by United States authorities. Her husband still resides in\nRomania.\nIn addition to her husband, applicant has a mother-in-law, father-in-law, two\nsisters-in-law, and a brother-in-law who are citizens and residents of Romania.\nApplicant maintains daily contact with her husband and weekly contact with other family\nmembers residing in Romania.\nApplicant renewed her Romanian passport in 1998, after she became a United\nStates citizen. She renewed it again in 2003. When it expires in October 2008, she will\nrenew it. She was issued a United States passport in 1999.\nApplicant traveled to Romania in 2004, 2006, and 2007. She used her Romanian\npassport instead of her United States passport on these trips. In her SOR response,\napplicant stated that the use of her Romanian passport \u201cyear after year is not an\nindication of foreign preference over the United States, it is a practical method of\nsimplifying the planning for a vacation that does not require me to request [from] the\nRomanian authorities a visa to enter Romania . . . .\u201d\nApplicant has a Romanian bank account with her husband worth $500.00. She\nopened the account while in Romania in 2007 and keeps it in case of an emergency\nwhile she is visiting that country. She has over $350,000.00 in assets in the United\nStates.\nIn her SOR response, applicant stated that she has been living in the United\nStates for almost 20 years, and clearly has a preference for the United States over\nRomania and every other country.\nThe Government offered into evidence a 2007 United States Department of State\nReport on Romania\u2019s human rights practices (Exhibit 6). This report establishes the\nfollowing facts:\nRomania, a country with about 21.6 million citizens, is a constitutional\ndemocracy. Although the Romanian government addressed some human rights\nproblems during the year, abuses continued to occur. There were reports of illegal\nwiretapping of citizens, and the public has a widespread perception of corruption and\nlack of fairness within the judiciary. \n\n3\n \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion\nby any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\n\n4\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\nApplicant has daily contact with her husband, and weekly contact with other\nfamily members living in Romania. In addition, since moving to the United States in\n1986, she made at least four trips to Romania. Applicant\u2019s presence in Romania during\nthese trips made her and her family members potentially vulnerable to exploitation,\npressure, or coercion by the Romanian government. These facts raise concerns under\nall three disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s close and\nloving relationship to her husband, standing alone, creates a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation. Applicant provided insufficient credible evidence that it is unlikely she would\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\ngovernment and the interests of the United States, or that she is not vulnerable to a\nconflict of interest.\n\n5\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10 a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as possession of a current foreign passport, may be disqualifying.\nApplicant possessed and used a Romanian passport after becoming a United States\ncitizen. Accordingly, this disqualifying condition applies.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. Under Paragraph 11.a.,\nit may be mitigating if the \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth\nin a foreign country.\u201d This mitigating condition is applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas voluntarily maintained her dual citizenship, renewed and used her foreign passport\nafter becoming a United States citizen, and recently married a citizen and resident of\nRomania. These actions create a heightened risk of pressure, coercion, exploitation and\nduress. Although I have considered the fact that Romania and the United States have\nfriendly relations, this fact is not determinative. \u201cThe United States has a compelling\ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of\nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the\nUnited States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\n\n6\nI have carefully reviewed the administrative record, applicant*s submissions, and\nthe allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C, and I have evaluated applicant*s conduct in light of the whole\nperson concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive. After doing\nso, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under Guidelines B\nand C.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nGuideline B: AGAINST APPLICANT\nGuideline C: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, to 1.u. She also noted that allegations 1.i. to 1.o. were medical debts that may fall under her health insurance coverage. In response to the FORM, Applicant provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a public trust position noting that she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on July 22, 2008. She provided the contact information for her attorney and the Trustee in Bankruptcy but no other information concerning the bankruptcy action (See, Response to FORM, dated September 25, 2008). Applicant is a 56-year-old customer service representative for a defense contractor. She was married on September 12, 1995, but is now separated from her husband.

(Items 5 and 6) Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR (Item 2), her answers to interrogatories (Items 5 and 6), and credit reports (Items 7, 8, 9) establish that Applicant has delinquent debts, totaling approximately $25,000.

Blank, Jr. Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaires for Trust Position (SF 85P), on October \n3, 2005.  On March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for \nfinancial considerations (Item 1).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 11, 2008 (Item 3).  She \nanswered the SOR in writing on June 16, 2008.  She admitted the 21 allegations under \nGuideline F.  She noted that seven of the medical debts may have been cocvered by \nmedical insurance.  She elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing. (Item 2)  Department counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on \nAugust 12, 2008.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on \nAugust 25, 2008, and was provided the opportunity to file objections, and submit \n1 \n \nOctober 10, 2008\n\n2 \n \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant dated \nthe receipt for the FORM as August 25, 2007.  Since the FORM was not mailed until \nAugust 13, 2008, the date is a mistake and it was received by Applicant on August 25, \n2008.  Applicant provided additional information in response to the FORM on \nSeptember 25, 2008.  The case was assigned to me on October 7, 2008.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file and pleadings, eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, to \n1.u.  She also noted that allegations 1.i. to 1.o. were medical debts that may fall under \nher health insurance coverage.  In response to the FORM, Applicant provided additional \ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a public trust position noting that she \nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on July 22, 2008.  She provided the contact information \nfor her attorney and the Trustee in Bankruptcy but no other information concerning the \nbankruptcy action (See, Response to FORM, dated September 25, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old customer service representative for a defense \ncontractor.  She was married on September 12, 1995, but is now separated from her \nhusband.  She has two children but does not receive child support for the children.  \n(Items 5 and 6) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR (Item 2), her answers to interrogatories (Items 5 \nand 6), and credit reports (Items 7, 8, 9) establish that Applicant has delinquent debts, \ntotaling approximately $25,000.  The documents support a debt in collection for propane \nfor $119 (1.a); a telephone debt in collection for $190 (1.b) a medical debt in collection \nfor $120 (1.c); a telephone debt in collection for $40 (1.d); another telephone bill in \ncollection for $262 (1.e); a credit card debt charged off as a bad debt for $1,144 (1.f); \nanother credit card debt to the same creditor in collection for $1,169 (1.g); a credit \naccount in collection for $1,143 (1.h); an account in collection for $262 (1.i); medical \naccounts in collection for the same medical facility for $210 (1.j), $156 (1.k), $2,299 \n(1.l), $168 (1.m), $140 (1.n), $140 (1.o), and $171 (1.p); an account charged off for \n$12,343 (1.q); a loan account charged off for $5,354 (1.r); a car repossession in 2003 \n(1.s); and a car repossession in 2002 (1.t).  Also noted is a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed \nin 1992 but dismissed because Applicant could not make the required payments (1.u).  \nMost accounts were opened after 2000 and started being delinquent in 2001 and 2002.  \nThe medical debts were accumulated in 2005, \n \n \nIn answers to interrogatories, Applicant noted that the credit card debts in \nallegations 1.f and 1.g are the same debt (item 5).  It is reasonable to believe that they \nare the same debt.  She also believed the credit limit on the card was only $500.  \nApplicant provided no information on any payments made on the account.  She does \nrecall using the card for small purchases.  She occasionally receives calls concerning \nthe debt.  She stopped making payments on the debt because she could no longer \nafford to make the monthly payments (Item 6 at 3-4).   \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant did have telephone service with the telephone company in allegations \n1.d and 1.e.  She paid about two monthly bills but had to stop paying because she could \nnot afford the high long distance bills (Item 6 at 4).  Applicant also stated she made car \npayments for about two years on two cars, one for her and one for her son.  She could \nnot continue the payments so the cars were repossessed (Item 6 at 4). \n \n \nApplicant stated the medical debts at allegations 1.i to 1.p were for medical \nprocedures she received in 2005.  She had health insurance at the time that should \nhave paid part of the medical bills.  She should have only paid a co-payment.  When the \ndebts became delinquent, she no longer had the health insurance so the claim could not \nbe filed with the insurance company.  Applicant presented no information concerning \nany contact she had with the insurance company.  Applicant stated that she established \na $20 per month payment plan for the medical debts in April 2007.  She presented no \ninformation concerning any payments made according to this plan (Item 6).   \n \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1992 but it was dismissed within a \nyear because she could not make the required payments.  At the time of her interview \nwith security investigators, Applicant stated that her monthly income was about $1,300 \nwith monthly expenses of about $1,341 leaving a deficit for the month.  She usually \nbreaks even each month if she works overtime and at a part-time job.  She admits she \nlives paycheck to paycheck (Item 6 at 5-7). \n \n \nApplicant noted that she has not had a lien placed against her property or \njudgment against her for failing to pay taxes or other financial delinquency.  The \ndelinquencies are not because of drug or alcohol abuse, or gambling.  She does not \nknow of anyone who would question her willingness to pay her debts.  She has never \nreceived financial counseling.  She want to pay all of her delinquent debts, and she is \npaying what she can afford to pay (Item 6, at 5). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n4 \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a security concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \n\n5 \n \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit cards, medical debts, loans, \ntelephone bills, as established by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions, are a \nsecurity concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations).  Applicant has significant delinquent debts that she has \nnot addressed or resolved.   \n \n \nI have considered a number of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \n(FC MC).  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  \nWhile the debts may have been incurred in the past, they are still unpaid and thus \ncurrent.  There are a number of different accounts and debts, so the debts were not \nincurred infrequently.  Although she is a single mother, she has not established that \ndelinquent debts would not recur.  The continued debts and financial situation cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant has not presented any \ninformation to establish circumstances prevented her from changing her situation \nenabling her to pay debts.  She stated that some of the medical debts should have been \npaid by her health insurance.  However, she presented no information to show any \ninquiry of the insurance company or any attempt to have them pay the debts.   \n \n \nApplicant stated that she has not received financial counseling so FC MC \u00b6 20(a) \n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.  \nExcept for her statement that she is paying $20 monthly towards medical bills and that \nshe recently filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, she has not presented any information to \nshow she is making arrangements to pay her creditors.  There is no clear indication that \nthe problem is being resolved.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Applicant's response to \nthe FORM states that she filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on July 23, 2008.  She \nlisted the name of her attorney and the Trustee in Bankruptcy.  However, she presented \nno other information concerning the filing or the status of the planned payments.  While \nbankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of resolving debts, her information is not \nsufficient to show that she has made a good-faith effort to pay her debts.  She stated \nshe is paying $20 monthly towards her medical debts but presented no information to \n\n6 \n \nestablish the payments.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate \nsecurity concerns for financial considerations. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has not presented \nsufficient information to show she has taken sufficient action to resolve her financial \nissues.  She noted that she recently filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  She did not \npresent any information on the payment plan under the bankruptcy or any payments \nmade according to the plan.  When she filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1992, it was \ndismissed because she could not make the required payments.  With this history, \nApplicant's promise to pay her debts in the future is not sufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns.  She has not presented a consistent record of actions to resolve financial \nissues.  She has not established that she has taken timely and reasonable steps over \nthe years to address her financial problems.  The record shows that she has been \nirresponsible towards her financial obligations indicating she may be unconcerned, \nirresponsible, or careless concerning sensitive information.  Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n7 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.jf:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), signed on September 26, 2006. \nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \n \n1 \nJune 10, 2010\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn September 25, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guidelines J and E of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Applicant \nsigned and notarized her first Answer on November 3, 2009. However, she failed to \neither admit or deny each allegation, and DOHA requested that she resubmit her \nAnswer. She notarized a complete second Answer on November 22, 2009. Applicant \nadmitted the five allegations under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, with explanations. \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, she admitted allegation 1.a. and denied the \nremaining allegations.3 Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 26, \n2010, and the case was assigned to me on February 2, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on March 3, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 23, 2010. \nThe Government offered four exhibits, which I admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4. Applicant offered three exhibits, which I admitted as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) \nA through C.4 DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 50 years old, submitted an application to request a security clearance \nas part of her job as a security officer for a defense contractor. She completed high \nschool in 1978. She has been married for 30 years and has four adult children and one \n13-year-old son.

I note that Applicant's \nanswer to allegation 1.e. under Guideline J contradicted her answers to allegations under Guideline E. In \nher response to allegation 1.e., she admitted falsification of answers on her security clearance \napplication. However, she denied falsifying these same answers in her response to the allegations under \nGuideline E. Viewing this contradiction in the light most favorable to the Applicant, and supported by \nApplicant's hearing testimony, I find that her intent was to deny all falsification allegations in the SOR. \n \n4 For administrative convenience, I severed these three documents from Applicant's first Answer so that \nthey could be offered by Applicant as exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nhas held a secret security clearance, but has not worked with classified information as \npart of her jobs. (GE 1; Tr. 20-23) \n \n \nDuring a weekend in 1996, Applicant had an argument with her 16-year-old \ndaughter. Applicant admits that she hit her daughter, who called the police. Applicant \nwas arrested on a charge of domestic assault. She remained in jail over the weekend \nuntil court was in session on Monday. She admitted her actions to the judge, and he \ndismissed the case. (GE 4; Tr. 30-32)  \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant was at a nightclub on a weekend with a friend. When they left, \nthe friend saw her boyfriend in a car with another woman. She went to the car and used \na broken bottle to puncture the tire. The other woman started fighting with Applicant's \nfriend, and Applicant went to her friend\u2019s aid. When the police arrived on the scene, they \nthought Applicant and/or her friend had a knife. They arrested the three women on \ncharges of Assault/Dangerous Weapon. Applicant denied that she or anyone else had a \nknife. She was incarcerated until Monday morning, when she appeared in court and the \ncase was dismissed, or in the local court\u2019s terminology, \u201cNo papered.\u201d Applicant testified \nthat \u201c\u2026I guess I\u2019ve just been so stupid getting involved in other people\u2019s stuff.\u201d (GE 2, 3; \nAE A; Tr. 34-37) \n \n \nApplicant was involved in an incident in 2002, when she was visiting a close \nfriend, who was the godmother of her son. While in a back room of her friend\u2019s home, \nApplicant heard her friend open the front door and then start arguing with another \nwoman. The other woman stabbed Applicant's friend. Applicant called for an \nambulance, and a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, Applicant was holding \nher injured friend, and there was blood on her. Applicant testified that \u2026\u201d[name], she \nstarted falling out. I wouldn\u2019t leave. I\u2019m not going to leave from my friend.\u201d The police \ncould not be sure who had attacked Applicant's friend, and arrested both Applicant and \nthe other woman. The charge against Applicant was Simple Assault/Domestic. Later, \nwhen the police interviewed Applicant's friend at the hospital, she informed them that it \nwas not Applicant but the other woman who had assaulted her. The police interviewed \nApplicant and then released her. She did not spend time in jail, and was not required to \nappear in court. The charge was \u201cno papered.\u201d (GE 2, 3; AE B; Tr. 37-43) \n \n \nApplicant's neighbor is a middle-aged man who is physically and mentally \nimpaired. He had been cared for by his aunt. In 2004, before she died, the aunt asked \nApplicant to care for her nephew, because his family would not. From 2004 to 2006, \nApplicant took care of him without financial assistance. She became his legal guardian \nin 2006, and now receives monthly Social Security disability payments to help support \nhim. He is 58 years old and resides in House B, next door to Applicant\u2019s home, House \nA. She owns both houses. Applicant also took care of her brother\u2019s two children after he \nwas murdered. She took care of them from 2003 to 2004 until their mother was \nfinancially able to support them. (GE 2; Tr. 44, 46) \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn 2004, police received reports of illegal drug activity in House B. as Applicant \nand her husband owned both House A and House B, the police investigated both \nhouses. Applicant allowed the police to search her home, where they found a gun, \nammunition, and a bag of marijuana. Applicant admits that the ammunition was hers. As \npart of her job as a security officer, Applicant is required to be proficient in shooting. She \nhas a license for the gun she uses in her job, which is stored at her work site. She \npractices regularly at a firing range, where she rents a gun. Around the time of this \nevent, she had been practicing at a firing range. She had excess ammunition, and \ndecided to bring it home because she was planning to go back and practice again in a \nfew days. She was aware that it was illegal to have the ammunition in her home, and \nadmitted at the hearing that it was wrong to bring it home. (GE 2; AE C; Tr. 43-49) \n \n \nThe gun and marijuana belonged to Applicant's son. She was not aware that he \nhad them in the house. Her son had a history of using and selling marijuana, and was \ninvolved in illegal drug activities since the age of 16. At the time of her security interview \nin late 2007, Applicant's son was serving a six-year jail sentence for possessing an \nunregistered weapon and distributing illegal drugs. At the time of the hearing, he had \njust been released. At her security interview, she told the agent that she would not allow \nher son to live with her in the future. (GE 2; Tr. 49-51) \n \n \nAs a result of the police search, Applicant and her husband were arrested and \ncharged with having an unregistered gun, unregistered ammunition, and possession of \ncannabis. They spent the night in jail and appeared in court, without counsel, the next \nday. The charges were listed as \u201cunregistered gun; ammunition violation.\u201d The case was \n\u201cno papered.\u201d Applicant and her husband did not have the services of an attorney. (GE \n2, 3; AE C; Tr. 52-53) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on her security clearance application that she was terminated \nfrom a job in 2004. Several events were occurring at that time: her car needed repairs \nbecause her husband had left her and had taken the better car; she wished to attend \nher grandfather\u2019s funeral in another state; and she needed dental surgery. Applicant \ndiscussed these issues with her supervisor, and showed him the paperwork about her \nsurgery. She asked if she could add some additional unpaid leave to her two weeks \nvacation. He denied the unpaid leave. She took the vacation time, but called to tell him \nthat she could not get back by the end of her vacation because of the car problems. He \nsaid that if she took additional time, she would be terminated. When she returned one \nday late, the supervisor told her to leave. Her current employers are aware of this \ntermination. (GE 2; Tr. 23-26) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 security clearance application contained questions about her \ncriminal record. Specifically, three questions asked whether she had ever been charged \nwith or convicted of a firearms offense; ever been charged with or convicted of a drug-\nrelated offense; or been arrested, charged, or convicted of any other offense within the \nprevious seven years. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to these questions. In her security \ninterview, and at the hearing, Applicant stated that thought these questions were \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nconcerned with convictions. As each of her cases was dismissed, Applicant believed \nthat she had no convictions to disclose. She testified,  \n \nI just didn\u2019t understand\u2026And I didn\u2019t know that charge is \u2013 I thought \ncharge is something you charge and it\u2019s on your record, and you went to \ncourt and everything. I didn\u2019t go all through court.  \n \nShe also stated that she only learned that she was charged when the security agent \nexplained it to her. Applicant testified,  \n \nAnd I told her I didn\u2019t know. I said, \u2018What \u2013 what do you mean charge? I \nwas never charged.\u2019 I kept saying that. And she said, \u2018You were charged \nbecause you was [sic] arrested.\u2019  \n \nApplicant provided court documents at the hearing that showed the charges and \ndisposition in the 1998, 2002, and 2004 incidents. They explained the distinction \nbetween an arrest and a conviction, and the meaning of an arrest record. Applicant \nobtained these documents in November 2009. (GE 2; AE A, B, C; Tr. 59-63) \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.5 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly \nreferred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying \nor mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. \nHowever, specific applicable guidelines are followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access \nto classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by \nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors \naddressed under Guidelines J and E. \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.  \n \n \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, \nthe government has a compelling interest in ensuring that each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the Government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern under this guideline: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply under AG \u00b6 31:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nBetween 1996 and 2004, Applicant was charged with several crimes including \ndomestic assault, assault with a dangerous weapon, and firearms and drug possession. \nFor the domestic assault charge in 2002, she was questioned and released. In the other \ninstances, she admits that she spent a night or two in jail awaiting a court appearance. \nAll charges were \u201cno papered\u201d or dismissed. AG \u00b6 31 (a) and (c) apply. \n \nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant under AG \u00b6 32:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n8 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 (a) applies. The most recent event occurred in 2004, six years ago, and the \nmost distant in time occurred in 1996, 14 years ago. In one event, Applicant committed \nassault, when she hit her daughter. However, Applicant is now 14 years older, her \ndaughter is an adult, and Applicant has only one son to care for, all facts that indicate \nsimilar circumstances are unlikely to recur. In two other criminal incidents, Applicant \nwas not the key player, but simply sought to help friends, which reflects well on her \ncharacter. AG \u00b6 32 (d) is relevant because there is no evidence Applicant engaged in \ncriminal conduct, or has even been present when others engaged in criminal conduct, in \nthe past six years. In the instance where she did violate a local law by storing her \nammunition in her home, she admitted that she was wrong to do it, and there is no \nevidence that she has repeated that action since 2004. Her statements and conduct \nshow rehabilitation, and AG \u00b6 32(d) applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern under the personal conduct guideline is that  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) \n \nThe facts presented support application of the following disqualifying condition under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable \nbehavior\u2026  \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified information she provided on \nher 2006 security clearance application, which implicates AG \u00b6 16(a). She was involved \nin four criminal incidents. She spent one or two nights in jail and appeared in court in \nrelation to three of these events. The charges were dismissed in all four cases. \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d on the application because she misunderstood the term \n\u201ccharge.\u201d It appears that she conflated the meaning of the terms \u201ccharge\u201d and \n\u201cconviction\u201d and believed a \u201ccharge\u201d only existed if a judge found a person guilty in \ncourt. Because the judge dismissed each of her cases, and she was never found guilty, \nshe believed she had nothing to disclose. Applicant did not have the services of an \nattorney in these cases to explain the implications of these events or the meaning of the \nterms. She did obtain court documents that explained the legal terminology, but she did \nnot have these documents until 2009, almost three years after she completed her \nsecurity clearance application. Moreover, Applicant disclosed negative information on \nher application, including her termination from a job, and a financial delinquency. Based \non these disclosures, as well as Applicant's statements and demeanor at the hearing, I \nfind her explanation credible. As Applicant did not deliberately falsify her responses, no \nmitigation is required concerning falsification. \n \nApplicant was terminated from a job in 2004 because she took unapproved \nleave, which implicates disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16 (d) (1). The following mitigating \ncondition under AG \u00b6 I7 is relevant to Applicant's job termination: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \nApplicant's was experiencing a confluence of several stressful events at the time, \nincluding a medical condition requiring surgery, a car that required repairs and was \nunreliable, and the death of a family member that required out-of-state travel. It is \nunlikely that such a unique set of circumstances will recur. Moreover, she acted \nresponsibly by requesting the time in advance from her supervisor, and documenting \nher medical condition. Six years have passed since this termination and the record \nshows no recent indication of work-related problems that would raise questions as to \nher reliability or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 17 (c) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guidelines. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited guidelines, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n \nApplicant used poor judgment when she struck her teenaged daughter during a \nheated argument. However, that conduct occurred 14 years ago, and Applicant was \ncandid in admitting the conduct. She also admitted that she should not have brought \nhome the ammunition she intended to use in future target practice, required for her job. \nThe most serious charges related to drug and gun possession. However, these charges \nwere dismissed because they related not to Applicant's actions, but her son\u2019s. Two \nother criminal events, the most recent of which was six years ago, involved Applicant \nhelping friends who were in trouble. Applicant misunderstood the questions on her \nsecurity clearance application about criminal conduct, and credibly testified that she \nbelieved she was not required to report events that had been dismissed by a judge.  \n \nApplicant has also demonstrated maturity and character through her willingness \nto take in her brother\u2019s children when their mother was financially unable to do so; and \nby taking legal and financial responsibility for a neighbor when his family refused to do \nso. The record also shows that Applicant has provided more than a decade of service to \nthe federal government through her employment with defense contractors.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the cited security \nconcerns. A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information bearing on \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows she has satisfied the doubts raised \nunder the guidelines for criminal conduct and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.e.  \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.e.  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \nallow Applicant access to classified information.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn February 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position,\nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\ntrustworthiness determination clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 12, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 5, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nApril 15, 2008.  A hearing was held on April 30, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nApplicant\u2019s application for a public trust position.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and one exhibit.  The\nJuly 28, 2008\n\n2\ntranscript (R.T.) was received on May 20, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her bank statements.  For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted 14 days, to May 14, 2008, to supplement the record. The Government was\nafforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the\nrecord with documented copies of her bank statements and character references.  Two\nmonths later, she faxed a letter claiming she paid in full the debt covered by creditor 1.a\nof the SOR. Department counsel did not object to any of these post-hearing\nsubmissions.  Her post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated five debts\nexceeding $45, 000.00.  For her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the of the\ndebts, but denied her debt delinquencies indicated poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a\ntrustworthiness determination.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nWith her formal education and training in nursing, Applicant worked in the health\nfield for a number of years. Applicant married in 1977 and has two sons from the\nmarriage (now grown).  Her husband (H) inherited an interest in a family distribution\ncenter from his father.  For many years, Applicant and H owned and operated the\nbusiness.  \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s sons encountered drug problems after high school and\nbecame a source of continuous tension in the household.  Placing them in structured\nenvironments to better address their drug issues cost Applicant and H a great deal of\nmoney (R.T., at 21-22).  Applicant and H separated in 1996 and went through a very\ncontentious divorce.  Applicant coped for a number of years with regular participation in\nFamilies Anonymous (FA) group sessions.  She is credited with making commendable\nprogress in overcoming her emotional and other problems associated with the\ndestructive behaviors of H and her sons (see exs. B and C). \nApplicant and H finalized their divorce in 1999.  She estimates to have spent over\n$80,000.00 in legal fees on her divorce (R.T., at 28).  The divorce settlement apparently\ndid not provide for the coverage of her legal fees.  Under the terms of her negotiated\n\n3\ndivorce settlement, H made a lump sum payment of $80,000.00 to Applicant\u2019s attorney.\nShe says her attorney, in turn, kept $40,000.00 of the settlement funds to cover her\nearned attorneys fees (R.T., at 41).  Applicant later learned that her ex-husband\nremarried a younger woman sometime in 2000 and divorced her in 2007 (R.T., at 57).  \nFollowing their 1996 separation, Applicant\u2019s sons went to live with their father,\nwho continued to operate their distribution center.  With her own surplus funds,\nApplicant bought a house in 1998 and remodeled it.  After their divorce was final in\n2000, Applicant sold her home for a $30,000.00 loss (R.T., at 28-29).  For several years\nshe tried different jobs without any permanent success, and accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts (see exs. 3 and 4).   Five of these debts exceed  $45,000.00 and are\ncovered in the SOR R.T., at 35-38, 50-53).  The attorney she consulted in 2000\ncounseled against her filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief to steady her finances.  He\nexpressed concern she would lose the $1,500.00 a month share she received from her\nex-husband\u2019s business every month as a result of her divorce settlement (R.T., at 54-\n56).  These settlement funds are not due to expire until 2010, and Applicant did not\nwant to jeopardize her entitlement with any bankruptcy petition (R.T., at 55-56).  It is not\nclear whether the attorney recommended any kind of Chapter 13 petition for Applicant.\nBetween 2005 and 2007, Applicant was unable to retain steady employment,\nlosing jobs for various reasons after short tenures.  In April 2006, she took time off\n(approximately 55 days) from working to care for her gravely ill mother (R.T., at 32-33).\nShe estimates she could have made approximately $8,400.00 during this time based on\nthe $310.00 a day she was earning (R.T., at 32).\nApplicant has sought no financial counseling since her divorce, and has made no\ntangible effort before the hearing to repay any of her debts (R.T., at 40-43).  She claims\nto have since repaid creditor 1.a that she promised at hearing to pay (R.T., at 48), but\nprovides no payment documentation (see ex. F).\nApplicant is considered reliable and trustworthy by a number of old friends\nfamiliar with her divorce, family losses, and ongoing drug problems with her two sons\n(see exs. A through C).  Her admitted bank statements reflect regular activity in the\npayment of her current creditors (see ex. D).  She has a developed budget (see ex. E),\nwhich allocates expenses (estimated to be $4,497.00) against her current monthly\nincome (around $4,500.00).  This contrasts with the slightly better personal financial\nstatement she provided in November 2007, that included a $308.00 monthly remainder\n(see ex. 3).  \nPOLICIES\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of\nDefense for Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (ASDC31), entered\ninto a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which gave DOHA responsibility to provide\n\n4\ntrustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel working on unclassified\nInformation Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E2.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\n\n5\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is highly regarded by friends who have known her for many years.\nMost of her listed delinquent accounts continue to remain unresolved.  Absent\ndocumented discharge or payment initiatives with the listed creditors (including her\ncreditor 1.a debt which she claims to have recently paid),  these debts raise security\nsignificant concerns.  \n In Applicant\u2019s case, her still outstanding delinquent debts and her failure to\ndocument the lone debt she claims to have paid warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 19 (a)\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d These disqualifying conditions cover the core concern of AG \u00b6\n18: poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, which, both individually and collectively, can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to safely occupy a position of trust.  \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debts are attributable in part to contentious and\nexpensive divorce proceedings, periods of unemployment, and family medical issues\nassociated with her mother\u2019s grave illness, and her earlier problems (both emotional\nand financial) with her sons with drug-related issues.  Her historical difficulties with\nfamily and employment establish extenuating circumstances sufficient to warrant some\napplication of MC 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18.\nAt this time, none of Applicant\u2019s covered debts are documented to have been\npaid, disputed, or settled.  They exceed $45,000.00 in the aggregate and represent a\nconsiderable debt load on her current income sources.  Most of her debts are quite old,\nand appear to be covered by her state\u2019s statute of limitations. The state statute of\nlimitations in Applicant\u2019s state for claims based on a written contract is four years See\n16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16.051 (statute of limitations for\ncontracts and claims not otherwise provided for) and 16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations\nfor debts).  Applicant\u2019s listed debts with creditors 1.a through 1.e, all appear to covered\n\n6\nby the State\u2019s statute of limitations, and are treated, as such, herein as debts that are\ntime-barred.  \nWhile potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by\nour Appeal Board to absolve security risks associated with unresolved delinquent\ndebts, statutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for\ndiscouraging plaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.\nThey have never been equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue\ncreditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting\nISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, she has experienced some difficult periods of family and\nfinancial stress.  She has also made important choices about avoiding relief measures\nsuch as Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief to save a major income stream from her divorce\nsettlement.  To accord Applicant statute of limitation relief in these circumstances\nwithout some evidence of repayment efforts with funds available to her is to invite\ndisregard of established Appeal Board precedents with out any accompanying good-\nfaith repayment efforts.  By virtue of the age and non-enforcement status of the listed\ndebts alone, MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be applied to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.    \nWithout more documented information to demonstrate she is addressing her\nlisted debts and making use of financial counseling, she cannot safely mitigate all of\nthe Government\u2019s financial concerns.  Holding a public trust position involves the\nexercise of important fiducial responsibilities, which include the expectancy of\nconsistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a person cleared for access to\nclassified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder\nof the clearance.  While the principal concern of a trust position holder\u2019s demonstrated\nfinancial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust\nconcerns are implicit in financial cases.\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations is insufficient to enable\nApplicant to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying\nconditions covered by AG\u00b6 18.  Without more to demonstrate progress in resolving her\nremaining debts, or document payment of the one debt she claims to have paid\n(creditor 1.a), it is difficult to draw convincing conclusions about her overall\ntrustworthiness based on factors not covered in the mitigation conditions of the\nguideline for financial considerations.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunsatisfied debts and overall presentation of payment histories, Applicant does not\nmitigate security concerns related to her still outstanding debts.  Unfavorable\n\n7\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a\nthrough 1.e). \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT   \nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for\na public trust position.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 15 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on December 3, 2007, and was scheduled for\nhearing on January 29, 2008.  A hearing was held on January 29, 2008, for the purpose\nof considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one\nMarch 26, 2008\n\n2\nexhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 6, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is denied.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated three debts exceeding\n$16,000.00.  Under Guideline E, he allegedly falsified his security clearance application\nof October 2006, by denying repossession of a vehicle and debts over 180 and 90 days\ndelinquent, respectively. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the alleged debts, but\nexplains that the first creditor (creditor 1.a) went out of business and disputes the\namount owed on the deficiency claimed by creditor 1.c following his vehicle\nrepossession.  Applicant denied the third alleged debt altogether (creditor 1.b),  claiming\nthe debt was supposed to have been paid from escrow funds when he purchased his\nfirst home in 2001.  Responding to the falsification allegations covered by Guideline E,\nApplicant denied any intentional omission of the information called for in his security\nclearance application.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 33-year-old computer technician for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married his current spouse in April 1995 and has two children (ages 11\nand 12).  Applicant provides financial support for his wife and children. \nApplicant incurred three major debts between 1999 and 2004 that collectively\nexceed $16,000.00.  He and his wife purchased furniture from a furniture retailer in\n1999 and made regular payments on the account for several years.  The store\nreportedly closed in 2001, and left Applicant no forwarding address to send his\npayments.  Credit reporting records indicate that the furniture account has since been\nassigned to a collection agent (creditor 1.a) with a carried balance of $1,307.00 (see ex.\n3).  Applicant was last contacted about the debt by creditor 1.a in 2003 (R.T., at 27-28).\nApplicant elected not to take care of the debt at that time, and has had no contact with\nthe creditor since that last contact.  \nApplicant purchased furniture from creditor 1.a in April 2006 for $1,307.00 (ex. 2),\nshortly after his military discharge from the Army in 2001.  After making payments on\nthe account for several months he was informed that the creditor had gone out of\nbusiness with no forwarding address (R.T., at 27).  Applicant expresses a desire to pay\nthis debt, but has not been able to make contact with the creditor to ascertain what he\nowes (R.T., at 29).  He indicates a willingness to pay the debt if the creditor could\nfurnish him an accurate record of the debt (R.T., at 29).  To date, however, he has not\n\n3\nprovided any documentation of his past efforts to reach the creditor and address  this\ndebt.\nBesides his furniture debt, Applicant incurred a significant utility debt (creditor\n1.b) in April 2002 (ex. 2).  Applicant accumulated this debt while in the Army Reserves\nand claims the debt was arranged to be discharged from an escrow account established\nto fund his first home purchase in 2001 (R.T., at 30-31).  While he claims to have\nrequested his wife to take care of the bill during his absence and disputed this debt\nseveral times with credit reporting agencies, he provides no documentation of the\nescrow account in question, his requests to his wife to resolve the debt, or his disputes\nof the debt with either the creditor or the credit reporting agencies.  The debt remains on\nhis latest credit report (see ex. 2) as an unpaid debt in collection status, and to date has\nnot been addressed by Applicant in any way that can be documented.  \nApplicant\u2019s third listed debt (creditor 1.c) on the SOR reflects a deficiency on a\nvehicle that was repossessed by the creditor in January 2003.  Records report that\nApplicant purchased the vehicle in April 2000 for the amount of $20,377.00 (see ex. 2).\nUnable to afford the payments, he voluntarily returned the vehicle to the seller.\nApplicant\u2019s credit records report that the sum of $15,272.00 was owning on the vehicle\nwhen the seller repossessed it (ex. 3).  Although Applicant claims he was never credited\nwith any proceeds of the sale of the repossessed vehicle (R.T., at 31), he provides no\ndocumentation of his claims.  The delinquent debt documented in his April 2007 credit\nreport lists a deficiency balance of $11,881.00 as of December 2006 (see ex. 3).  This\nwould appear to indicate at least a partial credit on the carried deficiency that was\nreported in January 2003 before the creditor\u2019s repossession.  Without more to\ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s claims, inferences warrant that he was credited with some\nreduction of the deficiency balance.  Whether the reduction represents credit proceeds\nfrom the public sale of the vehicle or something else is unclear. \nBased on his personal income statement, Applicant nets about $2,800.00 a\nmonth from his work (see ex. 3).  His monthly expenses total $1,220.00, and his\nmonthly debts total $2,612.00 (without any indicated amounts apportioned to cover the\nlisted debts in the SOR).  This leaves him with a reported net negative remainder of\n$1,032.00 (see ex. 3).  Applicant believes his negative monthly remainder is a little\nlower now (around $900.00) according to Applicant (R.T., at 38).  Applicant says his\ncurrent net assures he is able to keep up with his current expenses and debts (including\nthe car payment on the 2007 Dodge Charger he purchased last year) despite his\nnegative remainder (R.T., at 38-40).  However, he provides no budget or other road\nmap to show how he can address any of his covered debts with the resources he\ncurrently has available to him.\nApplicant has sought no formal counseling regarding his finances. He assures he\nis not behind with any of his bills, but could identify no source of emergency relief to\nhelp him with his listed debts. \n\n4\nAsked to complete a security clearance application (e-qip) in October 2006,\nApplicant omitted his car repossession and debts over180 and 90 days delinquent,\nrespectively, when responding to questions 27B and 28A/B.  He was not exactly sure\nwhy he answered the questions in the negative and attributed his omissions to speed\nand confusion and cites his acknowledged repossession and delinquent debts in the\nsecurity clearance application (SF-86) he completed in his May 2005 (see ex. A; R.T., at\n40-43) as documented proof of his claimed mistaken omissions.  In this 2005 SF-86 he\ndid answer affirmatively to questions 35, 38 and 39 and listed his repossession and auto\nloan on the same vehicle while omitting his other two debts (see ex. A). \nSeveral months after completing his e-qip, Applicant was interviewed by an agent\nfrom OPM (R.T., at 44-47).  Applicant recalls reviewing his credit report with the agent\nand answering questions about certain debts listed in the credit report (R.T., at 46-48),\nbut does not recollect the precise order of the questioning.  Considering Applicant\u2019s\ninitial acknowledging of his car repossession and debts over 180 and 90 days\ndelinquent in his 2005 SF-86 and his corrections when asked in his scheduled interview,\nhis claims of inadvertent omission are accepted as both plausible and credible.\nInferences warrant that Applicant\u2019s initial omissions were not deliberate, and not made\nwith any intent to intentionally mislead the Government.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\n\n5\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure\nto cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversarial proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance.

Considered together, and without resolution, they\nraise  security significant concerns.  Of initial security concern, too, are Applicant\u2019s\n\n6\nomissions of his vehicle repossession and delinquent debs in the security clearance\napplication he completed in 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d and place the\nperson \u201cat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past failure to address them warrant the\napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to confusion and misunderstandings\nover the debts.  One of the creditors Applicant claims went out of business years ago\n(creditor 1.a).  A second debt he thought was paid from the escrow created for the\npurchase of his home (creditor 1.b). A third debt he claims was never substantiated to\nhis satisfaction (creditor 1.c).  He provides no documentation, however, to corroborate\nhis claims, and these debts remain unresolved, significant debts on his credit reports.\nAfforded an opportunity to do so, Applicant has not provided any documented plans for\naddressing any of the three listed delinquent debts with the resources available to him.\nNor has he sought financial counseling to explore other ways of discharging his three\nlisted debts. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his three debts are plausible and reasonable to a\ndegree. They certainly show why he may have harbored initial confusion and\nuncertainty about addressing them.  But once he was shown a copy of his credit report\nby the OPM agent who interviewed him in late 2006, he was placed on notice of the\noutstanding status of these three listed debts, and afforded a clear opportunity to\ninvestigate them and dispute them if he disagreed with them.  Extenuating\ncircumstances sufficient to warrant application of MC 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\nof the Guidelines for financial considerations are not demonstrated in this record.  \nMitigation credit is not available either to Applicant based on his proofs. Without\nany credible demonstration of concrete steps to resolve his three listed debts or seek\nfinancial counseling, none of the mitigating conditions are available to Applicant. \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\n\n7\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations does not enable Applicant\nto surmount security concerns either.  Documented efforts to address the debts,\nendorsements, employment history, and evidence of extenuating circumstances all\ncould have a bearing on Applicant\u2019s demonstrated reliability and trustworthiness, but\nare not available in this record.  Without more, it is difficult to draw convincing\nconclusions about Applicant\u2019s overall trustworthiness based on factors not covered in\nthe mitigation conditions of the guideline for financial considerations.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\naccumulated debts, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to his proven\ndebt delinquencies.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.c of the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s debt omissions in his e-qip\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s documented omitted\nrepossession and delinquent debts in the e-qip he completed in October 2006.  He\nattributed his omissions to inadvertence and cites his prior listing of his repossession\nand related deficiency in an earlier SF-86 as evidence of his lack of any intent to\ndeliberately mislead the Government.  His claims have merit. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\napplicant who acknowledged his repossession and debt delinquency in a previous\nsecurity clearance application and made prompt good-faith corrections of his e-quip\nomissions when inquired about his debts in an ensuing OPM interview. His e-qip\nomissions appear to be isolated candor lapses and not indicative of any overall trust\nproblem. \nBoth Applicant\u2019s accepted explanations and prompt, good faith corrections of the\nomissions in his ensuing OPM interview enable him to take advantage of two of the\nmitigating conditions available under Guideline E: MC 17(a), \u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts and MC 17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or\nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d   Based on both his own explanations and his\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omissions in his e-qip when initially asked by\nthe OPM agent, Applicant is able to successfully refute the allegations of falsification in\nthe SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n \nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 24, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On March 12, 2008, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s failure to mitigate the\nGuideline F security concerns is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant contends that the\noutstanding debts listed in the SOR have been paid off, successfully disputed, or charged off and are\nunenforceable due to the Arizona statute of limitation.  Applicant also states that he should have\nrequested a hearing instead of having his case decided on the written record because he believes that\nDepartment Counsel was present during the Judge\u2019s consideration of his case.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties began when Applicant and his wife\nbought a house in 1987 that they could not afford.  Their two children later developed serious\nmedical problems.  Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties became severe in 2001.  The SOR listed eight\nunpaid debts.\nApplicant admitted the debts listed in the SOR.  In response to DOHA interrogatories and\nthe File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant sent documentation regarding his debts.  In his\nappeal brief, Applicant attempts to further explain his attempts to settle his debts.  To the extent that\nthe explanation contains information not presented before the Judge reviewed the record, it cannot\nbe considered on appeal, since the Board cannot consider new evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-06553 at 2 (App. Bd. April 30, 2008).  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s choice to have his case decided on the written record rather than\nrequesting a hearing, Applicant has not shown that he was disadvantaged by that choice.  In this case,\nDepartment Counsel had no objection to Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, but did attach a one-\n\nCf. ISCR Case No. 00-0345 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2001) (discharge of a debt in bankruptcy does not preclude\n1\nconsideration of an applicant\u2019s history of financial problems); ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)\n(although an applicant legally may rely on the running of a statute of limitation to avoid paying a debt, such reliance does\nnot constitute a good faith effort to resolve debts within the meaning of the Directive).\n3\nparagraph argument in rebuttal to it.  There is no indication that Department Counsel had any further\ncontact with the Judge  or otherwise influenced the Judge\u2019s decision.   \nApplicant\u2019s reliance on the unenforceability of his debts under the Arizona statute of\nlimitations fails to demonstrate that the Judge erred.  Security clearance decisions are not controlled\nor limited by such statutes of limitation.  A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed\nat collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts.  Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Accordingly, even if a delinquent debt is\nlegally unenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a\ntimely manner.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).\n1\nThe federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in\npersons granted access to classified information.  Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n. 6\n(1980).  Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather involve predictive\njudgments about an applicant\u2019s security eligibility in light of the applicant\u2019s past conduct and present\ncircumstances.  Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  The federal\ngovernment need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information\nbefore it can deny or revoke access to classified information based on an applicant\u2019s conduct or\ncircumstances that raise security concerns even in the absence of security violations.  A history of\nfinancial difficulties raises security concerns.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0454 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb.\n7, 1997) (discussing negative security significance of a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring\nfinancial difficulties).  In light of his financial situation, Applicant had the burden of presenting\nevidence to demonstrate extenuation or mitigation sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Based on the documentation Applicant provided, the Judge discussed\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to improve his financial situation, but explained why the evidence he had\nprovided was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s security concerns.  See, e.g.,ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06553 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2008).  Given the record evidence in this case, it was not\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge conclude that Applicant had not met his burden\nof persuasion so as to warrant a favorable security clearance decision under the clearly consistent\nwith the national interest standard.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  Applicant has not demonstrated error on the\npart of the Judge.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.    \nSigned: Michael D.

On October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 28, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on December 28, 2007.  The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on that same \nday. There is nothing in the record indicating when Applicant received the FORM.  He \nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any additional material.  He responded \non February 21, 2008.

However, in subsequent responses, he claims the debt alleged in \nSOR\u00b6 1.g is his brother\u2019s or father\u2019s debt. (Item 3.)  \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to maintain his security clearance.  He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor since April 1984. He also served as an officer in the Army Reserves from \nMay 1980 to October 2001. He has held a security clearance since 1980. (Item 4; Item \n9.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts: \na $5,866 charged off credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 7 at 2); a $7,139 credit card \naccount charged off in March 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 2); a $3,500 \ncharged off credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Item 7 at 3); a $60,045 credit card account \nthat was charged off and turned over for collection, original balance was $27,024 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d; Item 6 at 10, 13); a $9,551 charged off credit card account that was turned over \nfor collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Item 6 at 13); a $2,242 charged off credit card account (SOR \n\u00b6 1.f; Item 6 at 8); a $918 charged off account (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Item 6 at 10); and a $3,471 \ncharged off credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.h; item 6 at 4.). \n \nApplicant and his wife first encountered financial problems when they bought a \nhouse in 1987 that they could not afford.  Their two children later developed serious \nmedical problems.  Their son had a heart defect and passed away in 1997.  In 1995, \ntheir daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumor. She is doing fine now but has \ndisabilities related to her illness.  During the period the children were sick, Applicant \nwanted to \u201cspare no expense for [his} kids.\u201d (Item 5 at 21; Item 11.) \n \nIn 2001, the financial debts caught up with Applicant. In July or August 2001, he \nconsulted a law office specializing in consumer credit counseling for assistance and to \nlearn how to deal with debt collectors and negotiate better settlements.  Applicant states \nthe program did not work. Creditors harassed him and others refused to go along with \nthe settlement agreements. In February 2002, he contemplated filing for bankruptcy and \nconsulted a bankruptcy attorney but decided against it. In 2005, he consulted the  \nbankruptcy lawyer again but did not file for bankruptcy. (Item 5 at 24-25; Item 8; Item \n11). \n \nAfter 2001, Applicant made no payments directly to creditors that existed as of \nthat date except for payments on secured debts, such as car loans and mortgage \npayments. He would attempt to settle debts only when the creditor contacted him.  He \nclaims he has remained current on all secured debt payments and on all unsecured \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndebts that he incurred after August 2001. Between 2005 to 2007, he settled several of \nhis delinquent debts. He paid approximately $9,000 in total settlement payments. He \nresolved approximately five accounts that were not alleged in the SOR.  (Item 5 at 37, \n38, 40-41, 44, 47; Item 11) \n \nApplicant believes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is his brother\u2019s debt.  He claims \nthat his father co-signed on a lease for restaurant equipment. Applicant has the same \nname as his father. (Item 11.) The debt was removed from his most recent credit report. \n(Item 15.)  No documentation was provided verifying that this was his brother\u2019s debt. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant and his wife took steps to improve their financial situation. He \nstarted a part-time job and his wife obtained full-time employment. They have worked to \nimprove their credit score and their savings.  His wife currently has approximately \n$20,000 in savings. (Item 5 at 21; Item 11) He has approximately $8,618 in an \ninvestment account. (Item 5 at 33) They have a lot of equity in their home which \nApplicant claims that they can refinance in order to pay delinquent debts. (Item 5 at 35-\n36) A financial worksheet completed on October 3, 2007, indicated that Applicant and \nhis wife have total assets of $128,643. After monthly expenses, they have \napproximately $1,508 left over each month in discretionary income. (Item 5 at 22.) \n \nAs of October 3, 2007, his credit score was rated by TransUnion as 618 which is \nviewed as between fair and poor. Experian listed his credit score as 579 which is \nviewed as poor.  Equifax listed his credit score as 617 which is viewed as fair and poor. \n(Item 5 at 55.)  \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a letter from the attorney he \nconsulted in 2002 and 2005 regarding filing for bankruptcy.  The attorney states that \nApplicant consulted him in February 2001, when he was initially considering filing for \nbankruptcy and in 2005.  On February 11, 2008, he retained the attorney to assess the \ndebts alleged in the SOR.  The attorney indicates that all of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.h have passed the Arizona statute of limitations. Arizona law (4 Arizona Revised \nStatutes \u00a7 12-548) states that creditors holding a claim based upon a written contract \nfor payment of money must initiate their collection efforts against the responsible party \nwithin six years from the date that there was any conduct by the debtor/obligor \nregarding such debt. The attorney concludes that Applicant no longer owes any of the \ndebts due to the statute of limitations. (Item 10.)  \n \nApplicant states that with the exception of the creditors listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and  \n1.d, no collection efforts have been taken against him. He claims these delinquent debts \nwill not put any pressure on him because Arizona state law prohibits any collection \nefforts now, and any future collection efforts violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices \nAct. (Item 11.)  On February 20, 2008, Applicant retained a law firm for the purpose of \nworking with the credit bureaus to audit and verify the status of Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports.  The law firm is looking into the status of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.f \nand 1.h.  There is a notation that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is settled. (Item 12.) A \nsettlement agreement, dated February 22, 2008, was included. In the agreement, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant agrees to make monthly payments to the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.a until May 28, \n2008.  The first payment was due on February 28, 2008. No proof of Applicant\u2019s first \npayment was provided. (Item 13.) On May 28, 2008, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a will be \nsettled provided Applicant meets the terms of the settlement agreement. \n \nA credit report, dated February 15, 2008, lists the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.d, and 1.f as delinquent. (Item 15.)  Applicant provided no information about his work \nperformance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since \n2001, Applicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations. He incurred numerous \ndelinquent accounts, primarily consisting of delinquent credit card accounts. The SOR \nalleged eight delinquent accounts that were either charged off or turned over for \ncollection with a total approximate balance of $92,732.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility goes back to at least 1987 when he \nbought a house that he could not afford. He incurred numerous delinquent accounts.  \nAlthough Applicant maintains that his debts are uncollectable due to the statute of \nlimitations, his history of financial irresponsibility casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  Applicant had the income to resolve the debts. He \nadmits that he only resolved the accounts where he was contacted by the creditor. With \nthe exception of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, he is not disputing any of the accounts \n\n \n6 \n \n \nalleged in the SOR.  They are his financial obligations. He passively waited until the \nstatute of limitations to expire (an issue that is debatable) rather than honor his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) should be considered due to his children\u2019s \nserious health issues. However, it appears that most of the delinquent debt is consumer \ndebt as opposed to medical debt. Applicant did not provide information as to the extent \nof the medical expenses that were not covered by insurance or some other source. His \nmore serious financial problems occurred in 2001, several years after both children \nwere diagnosed with serious health issues. He settled some accounts but most of the \naccounts are apparently uncollectable due to the statute of limitations. Applicant only \nresolved those accounts where the creditor contacted him directly. He did not actively \nseek out to resolve his delinquent accounts. Based on these reasons, I cannot conclude \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances.   \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling.  He sought out firms that would assist him in disputing and/or settle his \ndelinquent accounts. There is no evidence of financial counseling that would assist \nApplicant in developing a plan to avoid financial over-extension in the future.  I cannot \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is resolved given his past history of financial \nirresponsibility.    \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Applicant admits that he did not \nattempt to settle any delinquent accounts with creditors unless the creditor directly \ncontacted him.  Passively waiting for the statute of limitations to occur does not negate \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility. (See ISCR 03-20327 (App. Bd. October \n26, 2006) citing ISCR Case 98-0349 (App. Bd. February 3, 1999).  He inquired about \nfiling for bankruptcy in 2002 and 2005 but did not follow through with the bankruptcy.  \nHe entered into a repayment plan with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in February 2008. \nThat same month he consulted an attorney about the status of his debts and retained a \nlaw firm to help him dispute the remaining delinquent debts on his credit report.  These \nactions occurred three months after the SOR was issued. I cannot conclude that \nApplicant initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his overdue accounts.    \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) While Applicant claims the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is his brother\u2019s debt, he \nprovided no documentary evidence corroborating his assertion.  FC MC \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder the revised AG, the overall concern under financial considerations is not \nonly whether a person who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds but also the failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligation to his creditors remains \na security concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has provided no \ninformation about his work performance. While his financial problems are mitigated, in \npart, due to his children\u2019s serious health issues, his inaction in resolving most of his \ndelinquent accounts when he had the means to do so leaves me with doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on March 2, 2006 (Gov X 4). On July 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns for foreign preference under Guideline C (Gov X 1). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nAugust 5, 2009 (Gov X 2). \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 19, 2009. He admitted one allegation, \nand denied the other allegation. He provided an explanation for his denial of allegation \nSOR 1.b. He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing (Gov X 3). Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on \nOctober 22, 2009. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nNovember 4, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file objections, and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant did not \nsubmit additional information. The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2010.  \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR 1.a, and denied the \nfactual allegation in SOR 1.b.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 73-year-old civil engineer who has worked for a defense contractor \nfor over eight years. He has both a bachelor's and master's degree in engineering from \nCanadian universities. He is seeking a security clearance to permit him to work on \nUnited States government projects overseas. Applicant was born in Trinidad and \nTobago, came to the United States in 1980, and has been a United States citizen since \nMay 1988. Applicant received a United States passport as early as August 21, 1988 \n(Gov X 4). His present United States passport was issued on January 31, 2008, and \nexpires on January 30, 2018. Applicant used his United States passport to enter \nTrinidad and Tobago in August 2008. At the time, Applicant also held a valid Trinidad \nand Tobago passport (Gov X 5).  \n \n \nApplicant learned of business opportunities in Trinidad and Tobago in 1996. He \nwas encouraged by his employer to seek dual citizenship with Trinidad and Tobago to \npermit him to engage in business there. Trinidad and Tobago citizenship is required to \nbe a business owner in the country. Applicant applied for and was granted Trinidad and \nTobago citizenship in December 1996. He received a Trinidad and Tobago passport \nwhich was to expire in December 2006. He used the Trinidad passport to enter Granada \nin March 2006. He applied for and received an extension of the Trinidad and Tobago \npassport in September 2006, after he was interviewed by security investigators \nconcerning his application for a security clearance. The passport expired on September \n27, 2008 (Gov X. 5).  \n \n \nApplicant established a limited engineering company in Trinidad and Tobago in \nDecember 1996, to enable him to seek business in that country for his employer. \nApplicant was the principal owner of the business, and responsible for decision-making \nin the company. Applicant's business function was to generate business projects in \nTrinidad and Tobago for his employer. All work would be done by Applicant's employer. \nHowever, the business venture did not generate work in Trinidad and Tobago and made \nno income in that country. He and his employer bid on potential work in Trinidad and \nTobago, but they were not awarded any contracts. Since there is no work in Trinidad \nand Tobago, there is no reason for him to continue to be a dual citizen or have a \nTrinidad and Tobago passport. In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he and \nhis employer decided not to renew his Trinidad and Tobago passport and he \nestablished his intention to relinquish his Trinidad and Tobago citizenship. (Gov. X 3).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States (AG \u00b6 9). Applicant was \nborn in Trinidad and Tobago but left that country in 1961. He came to the United States \nin 1980 and became a United States citizen in 1988. He requested and received \nTrinidad and Tobago citizenship in 1996 for business purposes. He applied for and \nreceived a Trinidad and Tobago passport in 1996, and used it to enter another country \nin 2006. These factors raise Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 \n10(a) (exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming \na United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This \nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport). His \nacquisition of Trinidad and Tobago citizenship also raises FP DC AG \u00b6 10(b) (action to \nacquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen).   \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence through Applicant's admission \nand statements in response to interrogatories, and established the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 10(a). The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns under foreign preference. Applicant \nhas the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden to prove or disprove it never shifts to the government. \n \nThe United States Supreme Court has recognized a right under the United States \nConstitution for United States citizens to have dual citizenship with another country \n(Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967)). However, eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be determined by application of the disqualifying conditions for foreign preference \nunder the factual circumstances. The President in promulgating the disqualifying \nconditions could have specified that dual citizenship by itself was a security concern, but \nhe did not. The rule that was promulgated raises a security concern based on an \nexercise of dual foreign citizenship. Applicant provided a copy of his Trinidad and \nTobago passport in response to interrogatories. The passport shows it was used in \nAugust 2006 to enter another country. The passport clearly shows it was to expire in \nSeptember 2006, was renewed before it expired, and expired again in September 2008.  \nHe has not renewed the passport since it expired in September 2008. Applicant does \nnot possess a current foreign passport. Applicant's possession of an expired, not \ncurrent, passport is not considered an exercise of dual citizenship under FP DC AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(1).  \nApplicant sought dual citizenship with Trinidad and Tobago in 1996 even though \nhe had become a United States citizen in 1988. The dual citizenship with Trinidad and \nTobago was for business purposes and not based on a preference for Trinidad and \nTobago over the United States. Since dual citizenship was obtained to facilitate \nbusiness opportunities, it was not based solely on Applicant's birth in Trinidad and \nTobago. Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) AG 11(a) (Dual citizenship is \nbased solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country) does not apply. \nApplicant established FP MC AG \u00b6 11(b) (The individual has expressed a \nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship). In response to the SOR, Applicant stated he \nand his employer decided there were no longer viable business opportunities in Trinidad \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand Tobago. He decided not to renew his Trinidad and Tobago passport and to \nrelinquish his dual citizenship with Trinidad and Tobago. The accumulated evidence \ndoes not show Applicant has a preference for Trinidad and Tobago over the United \nStates. He became a dual citizen not because he had a preference for Trinidad and \nTobago over the United States but for the limited purpose of doing business in that \ncountry. Applicant has mitigated security concerns for foreign preference raised by his \nexercise of the rights of foreign citizenship with Trinidad and Tobago by seeking \ncitizenship and a passport from that country. \nWhole Person Concept  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has been a United States citizen for over 20 years.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred approximately $16,572 in delinquent debt, including many charged off\ncollection accounts. He provided documentation concerning his payments in his repayment plan to\nhis creditors, and thus  mitigated the security concerns raised under the financial considerations\nguideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nIn January 2007, Applicant\u2019s case was terminated (ISCR -06-19209). In July 2007, the case was reactivated.\n2\nThe government submitted seven items in support of its contentions.\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated March 10, 2006).\n4\nId.\n5\nApplicant\u2019s answer to SOR, dated December 25, 2006.\n6\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn November 29, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected\nto have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on August 3, 2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant\n2\nmaterial (FORM) on August 7, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.   Applicant submitted additional\n3\ninformation on September 28, 2007. The case was assigned to me on October 5, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  allegations in subparagraphs  1.a through 1. f in his SOR response under\nGuideline F. The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After he graduated from the\nUSAF Preparatory School, he attended the USAF Academy. He is married with one son. He has\nworked for his current employer since December 2006.  On February 15, 2006, he completed his\n4\nsecurity clearance (SF 86) application.5\nApplicant held a secret level security clearance since 1995 with no incidents. He served in\nthe U.S. Air Force from 1994 until 2003, and received an honorable discharge. Applicant\nencountered a brief period of unemployment after leaving the military.6\nApplicant\u2019s debts in the SOR total approximately $16,572. There are numerous delinquent\nconsumer accounts from the period 1994 until 2001. Applicant maintains that he was paying all his\n\nResponse to FORM, dated September 28, 2007.\n7\nId.\n8\nId. at 3.\n9\nItem 3 (Answer to FORM, dated December 25, 2006).\n10\n3\ncreditors in a timely manner, but fees and high interest rates forced him to fall behind (30 days) on\nsome of them. In 2001, Applicant entered a credit counseling program, and entered a debt\nmanagement program. His required monthly payments were $548 a month. Applicant participated\nin this program for 19 months. He timely made each payment. He stopped the program in 2003. He\nleft the military at that point, and worked in the private sector. He had a short period of\nunemployment. Applicant moved to an area of higher living costs and received a lower salary. He\nincurred additional moving expenses and also did not receive his first paycheck for a few weeks after\nthe start of his employment. He contacted the consumer credit agency and tried to find another\nrepayment plan that would require less than $500 a month. He could not find one. He made smaller\npayments to some of his individual creditors when he could.7\nApplicant closed the accounts that were included in the debt repayment program. He made\nno further charges on any of those accounts.\nIn 2002, Applicant married and a son was born to them in 2004. His son has congenital heart\ndisease and requires continuous medical care. Applicant has paid the medical bills and extra\nexpenses for his son.8\nIn 2004, Applicant purchased a car. He explained he made a conscious decision to do this\nbecause he needed a car that would accommodate the baby car seat and other items necessary when\ntraveling with the baby. His previous vehicle had 100,000 miles on it and was starting to require\nmajor repairs. He was paying $307 a month on the car note. He decided to trade his wife\u2019s car to his\nsister-in-law. His sister-in-law paid Applicant $307 a month for the car. Based on a trade in and\ndiscounts, his monthly payment for the new car is $321. Thus, he maintained a similar level of\nmonthly payments and decreased maintenance costs.9\nApplicant opened four new credit lines in 2004. He does not carry a balance on any of them.\nHe uses them for business travel. He has multiple credit cards because the credit limit on each was\napproximately $500. He also wanted to establish a good credit history.\nFrom 2003 until 2006, Applicant did not have sufficient income to make payments to his\ncreditors. He kept his finances under control by prioritizing his bills. As soon as Applicant had his\ncurrent job offer in late 2006, he contacted a new consumer credit company.10\nIn 2006, Applicant entered another repayment plan. He received more financial guidance, has\na new budget and started making monthly payments. He is saving money and due to his higher\nsalary, he has paid off two accounts that were not listed in the SOR. He has reduced his debt from\n\nAttachments to Response to FORM, dated September 28, 2007.\n11\nAttachment A (Pay Stub, dated September 2007).\n12\nThis balance decreased from $5,487.\n13\nThis balance decreased from $3,405.\n14\nThis balance decreased from $2,335.\n15\nItem 5 (Response to Interrogatories, dated October 24, 2006).\n16\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n17\n4\n$21,302 to $11,936. His detailed payment plan provides that all accounts will be paid in less than\n20 months. 11\nHe earns approximately $5,000 net per month working a regular schedule. He earns more\nwith overtime (approximately $7,800).  Applicant also receives a Veterans benefit ($115 per\n12\nmonth).\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCredit c  a r  d                $3,817\nRepayment $196 mo\nAttachment C\n13\n1.b\nCredit card                $2,803\nRepayment $86 mo\nAttachment C\n14\n1.c\nCollection account    $1,849\nRepayment $54 mo\nAttachment D\n15\n1.d\nCollection account     $1,126\nSettled and paid\nAttachment E\n1.e\nCollection account     $4,228\nRepayment $141 mo\nAttachment F\nApplicant earned various medals and commendations while in the military. Among them is\nthe Air Force Training Ribbon, Outstanding Unit Award. Although he has been with his current\nemployer a short while, he received an appraisal reflecting remarkable growth and development. He\nhas proven to be an invaluable asset. He does not require frequent direction and can be trusted to\npursue the issues most important to leadership.16\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n17\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n18\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\u00b62 (a)(1)-(9).\n19\n Id.\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n21\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n23\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n24\n5\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n18\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n19\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n20\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.21\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n22\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n23\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n24\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n25\n6\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.25\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $16,000. He admits they are still outstanding debts except\nfor one that was settled. His 2007 credit report confirms his alleged debts. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does apply because\nApplicant\u2019s four debts are in a repayment plan. \nApplicant\u2019s debt occurred before his short period of unemployment and his son\u2019s medical\nproblems. His debt has been with him since the mid 1990's. He has no evidence to support the FC MC\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem/and or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or under control) applies in this case. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) also applies. FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the\ncause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) applies as well. \nApplicant has received financial counseling and developed a structured plan to resolve these\ndebts. Although he stopped his first repayment plan after 19 months due to a period of unemployment\nafter his discharge from the Air Force, he prioritized his bills. Due to the lower pay, he was not able\nto pay the initial $548 a month in his payment plan. Thus, his original plan was derailed. He could not\nfind another plan that would accept an amount lower than $500. So, he made smaller payments to\ncreditors whenever he could. There are clear indications that the financial problem is being resolved\nor is under control.\nAfter his son was born with a medical problem, Applicant was faced with numerous medical\nbills. This contributed to his inability to pay on his older debt. He paid his medical bills and provided\nfor his family. Applicant received a job in late 2006  that allowed him to again begin a repayment plan.\n\n7\nHe documented his payment plan and has reduced his debts. He now has a stable, good income. He\nhas a solid plan and the determination to resolve his debts. \nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Applicant has a very good work history and performance review. He was\nhonorably discharged from the Air Force. He provides for his family and his son who has major\nmedical problems. His inability to initially stay on his repayment plan did not cause him to give up.\nHe has made good faith efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. His steady income and his financial\ncounseling will allow him to continue to remain solvent. The issue is not whether Applicant is still\nlegally liable for any or all of her outstanding debts, but whether he has presented sufficient evidence\nof extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination.\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. It is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\n\n8\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on April 2, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.

At the hearing, he\ntestified that he had recently been served with a notice that the creditor was suing him\nto recover this debt and the court date was shortly after the hearing. Clearly, this debt\nhas yet to be resolved. \n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,876.\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that he was unaware of the status of this debt. I can not conclude that\nthis debt has been resolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,000.\nIn his RSOR, Applicant denied that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that he has paid off this debt in full, although he had no\ndocumentation to establish that he had resolved this debt. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,669.\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that he was unaware of the status of this debt.

In his RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the\nhearing, Applicant testified that except for a payment of $100 that he made on this debt\nin 2007, the total amount of this debt is still unpaid.\n\n4\n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $430.\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that except for a payment of $100 that he made on this debt in 2007,\nthe total amount of this debt is still unpaid.\nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties primarily began in 2006, when he\nbecame divorced from his wife and he went from a two income family to a one income\nfamily, with the additional financial burden of child support of $653 a month. He was\nalso assigned in the marriage dissolution to pay some of the debts that his former wife\nhad not paid.  He did borrow $17,000 from his 401(k) to pay off his Child Support\npayments and his gas and electric bills that were all overdue, as well as two of his\noverdue credit card debts. \nFinally, Applicant testified that in his current financial position, he does not see\nhimself being able to pay off his debts (Tr at 47).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay the majority of his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\n\n6\nfinancial problems arose primarily from Applicant\u2019s divorce.  However I can not conclude\nthat Applicant has acted responsibly under these circumstances because he has failed\nto contact the creditors of most of the overdue debts, and he has failed to attempt to\nseek some kind of financial counseling that might help him to ascertain a way to resolve\nthese overdue debts. Therefore, I do not find that this potentially mitigating condition is a\nfactor for consideration in this case. \n Applicant has not resolved the great majority of his overdue debt. I conclude that\nuntil he is able to significantly reduce his overdue debt, he has not mitigated the\nfinancial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition\napplies, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant  questions and doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.n.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nDecember 31, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 17, 2008, and waived her right to \na hearing before an administrative judge. On July 24, 2009, she withdrew her waiver, \nfiled another answer (Answer No. 2) and requested a hearing. On August 21, 2009, \nDOHA assigned the case to me. On September 21, 2009, DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing, setting the case for October 14, 2009. The case was heard as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through I into evidence without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript on October 21, 2009. The record remained open \nuntil October 29, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. \nShe timely submitted 14 documents that were marked as AE 1 through 14 and admitted \ninto the record without objection from Department Counsel.1                                                        \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6  \n1.c, 1.e, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, 1.aa, 1.bb, and 1.gg.

Her answers to    \nthose allegations are construed to be denials. \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and divorced. She married her first husband in 1988 \nand divorced in 1992. She and her ex-husband have two children, ages 18 and 19. She \nremarried in 1994 and divorced in 2004. They did not have children. She needs a few \nmore college credits to complete an associate\u2019s degree. Her children currently live with \ntheir grandparents as they complete school.  \n \n \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant worked for a large department store \nuntil 1992 or 1993. She then worked as a teller for a bank until 1998 and a clothing \nstore for the following year. In November 1999, she began employment with her current \nemployer as a contractor. In 2007, her employer promoted her to a supervising position \nin configuration and data management. She has three employees under her \nsupervision.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s financial difficulties began after she married her second husband, \nwho assumed control of the family finances. (Tr. 31.) In 1996, she learned that he was \nnot paying their bills. In February 1998, they filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and \ndischarged $65,369 of delinquent debt in August 1998, which included credit cards, \nutility debts, and many medical bills for her children and herself. (GE 3; Tr. 33.) Later in \ntheir marriage, she discovered that he was involved with another woman. When they \ndivorced in 2004, she became responsible for most of their debts because the accounts \nwere in her name. (Tr. 34.) \n                                            \n1Also included in the file are eight exhibits marked Items 3 through 10 that were previously sent to \nApplicant by the Government and appear to have been attached to Answer No. 2, and are included in the \nrecord.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In response to \u201cSection 27. Your \nFinancial Record: a. In the last 7 years have you filed a petition under any chapter of the \nbankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)? b. In the last 7 years, have you had a lien \nplaced against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?; d. In the last 7 \nyears, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid,\u201d she \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d  She did not disclose the $102 medical judgment that is alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b. In response to \u201cSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies: a. In the last 7 years, \nhave you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s),\u201d and \u201cSection 28: b. Are you \ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debts(s),\u201d she answered \u201cno,\u201d and failed to list \n17 of the 33 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant explained that her employer gave her the e-QIP and asked her to \ncomplete it the same day and did not provide any assistance. She knew she had debts, \nbut did not have a credit report to review. She did not realize that she could make a \nseparate written notation about her debts in the e-QIP. (Tr. 53; 67.) She denied that she \nintentionally falsified the application. (Answer.) \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant responded to the government\u2019s interrogatories about \nher finances and submitted attachments addressing some of them. (Item 2.) In March \n2008, Applicant entered into a contract with a credit services company to restore her \ncredit and provide credit education. (Tr. 36; Item 6.) She paid the company $941 as a \nretainer and has paid a monthly maintenance fee of $99 since May 15, 2008. (Item 6.) \nThe company initially verifies debts and then begins to resolve them. (Tr. 60.) She \nprovided a copy of the SOR to the company for reference. (Tr. 65.) She completed a \none-on-one counseling course class through the company. She learned to timely pay \nher bills to avoid additional fees and to switch the time frame in which to pay some bills \nto help her monthly cash flow. She has only one credit card now with a current balance \nof $293. (Tr. 70.)  \n \n \nWith the assistance of the credit services company, Applicant disputed the \nmedical bills listed on the SOR through the credit reporting agencies.  She claimed that \nshe was not responsible for them, having paid her co-pays. She thinks the amounts \nshown on credit reports are monies that the insurance companies billed her for amounts \nover their negotiated contracts. (Tr. 36; 62; GE 2.)  She also disputed other listed debts, \none of which she thought was a duplicate debt that was paid. \n \n \n \nThe May 2008 SOR alleged security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s financial \nhistory, which included a July 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of $65,000 of debt, \nand her subsequent accumulation of 32 delinquent debts totaling $26,293. The status of \neach of those debts is as follows:  \n \n  \n1. Applicant paid the four debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.t. They totaled \n$2,548, and included the $400 owed on her student loan (1.t.). (AE 1, 2, B, \nC.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n2. Applicant disputed the 18 medical debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, \n1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.u, 1.v, 1.w, 1.z, 1.dd, 1.ee, 1.ff. They have been \ndeleted from her credit file and total $2,548. (AE 3, 10; GE 2.)  \n \n3. Applicant disputed five other debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.r, 1.x, 1.y, and 1.cc. \nThey have been deleted from her credit file and total $5,790. (AE 3, 10.) She \nbelieves that the debt listed in \u00b6 1.x for $4,115 may be a duplicate of the \ncredit card debt listed in \u00b6 1.p. (Tr. 44, 45, 47, 24, 49, 50.) \n \n \n4.  Applicant admitted that she is responsible for paying five debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \n(a cable bill for $589 as of May 2008), 1.p (a credit card balance of $3,548 as \nof August 2003), 1.s (a personal loan for $415 as of October 2008), 1. aa (a \nbalance on an automobile repossessed as of September 2003 for $8,732), \nand, 1.bb (a credit card balance of $2,187 as of August 2006).2 These debts \nbecame delinquent between August 2003 and August 2008 and total \n$15,471. (AE 3, C; Item 9.) \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant has resolved $10,822 of the $26,293 in delinquent debt \nalleged in the SOR. She has yet to resolve $15,471 of the remaining debt, of which \n$8,732 relates to a 2003 automobile repossession and $3,548 is owed on a credit card \ndelinquent as of 2003.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted her budget. Her net monthly income is $3,065 and expenses \nare about $2,500, leaving a remainder of $400 at the end of the month, after deducting \na $100 credit service company\u2019s fee. (AE 12.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly. She presented numerous documents in an organized \nmanner, indicating that she has researched her debts and has attempted to resolve \nthem. She is aware of the importance of financial responsibility.  \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial problems that began \nwhen she married her second husband in 1994 and discharged $65,369 of delinquent \ndebt through a bankruptcy in July 1998. She continued to accumulate additional debts \nup to 2004 when she divorced, and after the divorce. She did not begin to address her \ndebts until she learned of the government\u2019s security concerns in October 2007. Some of \nher debt remains unresolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline, four of which may potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to her second husband, to whom she \nwas married from 1994 to 2004. During that time, he mismanaged their money, resulting \nin a bankruptcy in 1998. Upon her divorce in 2004, she assumed their delinquent debts \nbecause the accounts were in her name. Some of those conditions were beyond her \ncontrol; however, there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that subsequent to the \nbankruptcy and her divorce, she failed to responsibly manage her delinquent debts and \naccumulated new ones. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has very limited application.  \n \nApplicant provided evidence that in March 2008, she hired a company to resolve \nher debts and restore her credit. She has continued to work with that company, which \nhas assisted her in resolving 27 of the 32 debts listed on the SOR. She has also \nparticipated in individual credit counseling through the company. There is sufficient \nevidence to warrant the partial application of AG \u00b6 20(c), as some of her financial \ndelinquencies are slowly coming under control.  \n \nApplicant paid four delinquent debts, demonstrating a good-faith effort to resolve \nor pay those creditors, and warranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(d) to those debts.  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable in this case. Applicant produced evidence that she \nsuccessfully disputed 23 debts, beginning in March 2008 when she hired the credit \ncounseling company to help her resolve delinquent debts. She disputed 18 medical \ndebts because she believed she did not owe the monies and that the insurance \ncompanies were attempting to collect funds outside the scope of their contracts. She \nappeared to be uncertain about five non-medical debts, but thought the largest one, \n$4,115, was a duplicate credit card debt that was previously resolved.  \n \nBased on all of the facts discussed above, I find for Applicant under Guideline F. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b that Applicant falsified answers \nto two questions on her e-QIP, regarding disclosure of a judgment and debts more than \n90 or 180 days delinquent. The government contended that her omissions may raise a \nsecurity concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that she intentionally omitted information about the judgment \nand delinquent debts.  When a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the \ngovernment has the burden of proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not \nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, \n2004)). \n \nWhen completing her e-QIP, Applicant knew that she had debts, but did not know \nthe extent of those debts. She did not have any information available to her regarding \nher debts in order to accurately complete the e-QIP, and did not realize that she could \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nhave written a notation about them in the e-QIP. She was not given sufficient time to \ncomplete the form or assistance from her employer. After listening to her testimony and \nobserving her demeanor, I find that the omission of the information was not intentional. \nHence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification. This Guideline is found \nin her favor. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 40-year-old woman, \nwho has worked for a defense contractor for ten years and was recently promoted to a \nsupervisory position. She has a history of financial problems, dating to 1994 when she \nmarried her second husband. In 1998, she discharged a large amount of debt through \nbankruptcy. She continued to have financial issues with him until they divorced in 2004, \nincluding the accumulation of an August 2003 automobile loan debt and an August 2003 \ncredit card bill. Subsequently, she incurred additional delinquent debts. Since March \n2008, she has slowly attempted to resolve about $26,000 of delinquent debt in \nconjunction with the credit service company she hired. She has resolved 27 of the 32 \ndebts, representing about 40% of the debt amount, and owes five creditors, which \nrepresents about 60% of the debt amount, half of which relates to the automobile \nrepossession. \n \nGiven Applicant\u2019s awareness of the effect future delinquencies may have on her \nemployment, along with a believable commitment to responsibly manage her finances, I \ndo not believe similar problems will recur, despite a potentially tight budget. The Appeal \nBoard noted in ISCR Case No. 06-12930 \u201cthat an applicant is not required to show that \nshe has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has established a \nreasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken \u2018significant actions to implement \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nthat plan.\u2019 ISCR Case No.04-09684 at 2-3\u201d (App. Bd. Jul.6, 2006). In this case, \nApplicant has slowly worked to address many delinquent debts with the assistance of a \ncompany and has acknowledged five outstanding obligations and her credible intention \nto resolve them. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. There is no other evidence \nin her background to indicate that her current delinquent debts may create a security \nrisk. For all these reasons, conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.gg:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on September\n16, 2005. On March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on May 27, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 30, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE 1-10), which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own\nbehalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE A-B), without objection. I left the record open until\nJuly 7, 2008 for Applicant to submit additional documentation. He did not submit any\nJuly 31, 2008\n\n2\ndocuments. The record closed on July 7, 2008. DOHA received the transcript on July 9,\n2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 7, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, of the SOR. He denied the other allegations in the SOR\nbecause the debts were paid or he had no knowledge of them. He provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old. He graduated from high school in 1971. He married in\n1984 and has two children from that marriage. His youngest daughter, who is 18 years\nold, lives with him. He is currently separated. Applicant served in the Navy on active\nduty for almost 31 years until his retirement in May 2002 (GE1). He had a top secret\nclearance for his entire career. He also had access granted to sensitive compartmented\ninformation (SCI) due to the nature of his work.\nAfter Applicant left the Navy, he worked for six years with a government\ncontractor (Tr. 18). He worked out of the country for the majority of that time. His wife\nhad responsibility for the finances during their marriage. He was last deployed in\nFebruary 2007 for a period of four months.  \nIn May 2007, Applicant received a phone call from his daughter. She reported\nthat her mother (Applicant\u2019s wife) had not been home for two months (Tr. 21). Applicant\nleft his overseas employment and returned home due to the emergency situation. When\nhe returned home, he found unpaid bills and past due notices in plastic bags all over the\nhouse. His wife did not use the money that Applicant sent her to pay the bills (GE 2). \nWhen Applicant returned home, he learned that his wife had not paid the\nmortgage for approximately ten months. He paid the total amount of $11,172 that was\nowed. He also paid many smaller bills that he learned about that were not listed on the\nSOR (Tr. 53).\nIn June 2007, Applicant found employment as an assistant property\nadministrator. He immediately contacted his creditors and made arrangement to pay his\nbills. However, on March 4, 2008, he was laid off from that position. He could not\ncontinue to pay the delinquent bills. Applicant is limited to local employment because he\nprovides for his daughter and his wife never returned to the home. Thus, Applicant\ncannot find more lucrative employment deployed overseas as he once did. He is still\nunemployed (Tr. 26).\nApplicant contacted a credit company to help with his financial difficulties.\nHowever, he was not pleased with their customer service. He now has a person who is\na financial manager to help him discuss an equity loan (Tr. 55). He realizes that without\nemployment, he will most likely be denied a loan.\n\n3\nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in September 2007. He addressed\nthe items listed on the interrogatories. He had not received any bills or letters for some\nof them. He contacted creditors with the intention of paying them. He paid several\nmedical bills for his wife. He included another list of bills that he paid that were not\nidentified on the SOR. He paid a total of approximately $3,795 for those medical bills.\nHis plan to pay the smaller bills first and then the larger ones have been disrupted due\nto his unemployment since March 2008. \nApplicant has no knowledge of some of the accounts because his wife opened\nthem without his approval. He intends to pay them even if he is not legally responsible\nfor them.  \nIn April 2008, Applicant and his wife attended divorce mediation. His wife decided\nupon advice of counsel to pursue the matter in court. The judge ordered Applicant to\npay his wife $1,500 a month for support. Applicant is trying to have the amount modified\n(AE B). \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts/ collection accounts, four judgments,\nand approximately two unpaid medical debts. The total amount of the delinquent debt is\napproximately $27,000.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a collection account in the amount of $513. He denied this debt\nbecause he has no knowledge of this account. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an unpaid medical account for $211. It is his wife\u2019s medical bill (Tr.\n36). This is an unpaid portion that Applicant owes after his insurance paid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is another unpaid medical bill for $166. He believes this is his wife\u2019s\nbalance after insurance payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for an unpaid pizza in the amount of $25. He denies this is his.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a collection account in the amount of $1,290. Applicant does not\nhave any knowledge about this account.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a charged off account in the amount of $12,158. Applicant denies\nthis bill. He believes that his wife took out a loan or charged the amount on a credit\ncard. He has no knowledge of the account.\nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a charged off account in the amount of $1,381. He has no\nknowledge of this bill.\nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is another charged off account in the amount of $1,120 for which\nApplicant has no knowledge.\n\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a judgment in the amount of $615 for a dental bill that his wife did\nnot pay. This judgment was satisfied in 2007. Applicant\u2019s pay was garnished (GE 4).\nSOR \u00b61.j is a judgment in the amount of $1,161 for a credit account. Applicant\nhas no knowledge of the origin of this judgment.\nSOR \u00b61.k is a judgment in the amount of $1,165 for late condominium fees that\nhis wife did not pay in 2004. When Applicant learned that this matter was handled by a\nlaw firm, he contacted them. This judgment was satisfied by Applicant in 2007 (GE 7).\nSOR \u00b61.l is a judgment in the amount of $8,045. Applicant has no knowledge of\nthis account.\nThe accounts that are listed above for which Applicant had no knowledge remain\nunpaid at this time due to his unemployment.\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $3,400. This is his retirement and\ndisability income. After monthly expenses and civil support of $1,500 to his wife\nmonthly, he has a negative net remainder. He has approximately $5,000 in savings. He\nhas a prospect for a permanent position. He could gain more work overseas but that is\nnot feasible at this time due to his daughter at home (Tr. 50).\nApplicant recently applied for a permanent position. He passed the academic\nentrance exam and physical fitness exam. He is scheduled to take a polygraph test. He\nhopes to be offered the position (Tr.49). \nApplicant\u2019s military career for more than 31 years and his six years with a\ndefense contractor involved work of a highly sensitive nature. He has had no security\nissues or incidents during those 37 years. He received many medals and\ncommendations during his career service with the Department of the Navy (AE A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\n\n5\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has delinquent debts and four judgments and could not\nmeet his financial obligations from 2004-2007. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries are the result of his wife\u2019s inability to handle the household\nfinances while he was deployed. His wife left the home and her daughter while Applicant\nwas out of the country. He found the unpaid bills in the house. He immediately paid\ndelinquent bills, including a mortgage and medical bills. He became unemployed\nthrough no fault of his own in March 2008. He does not have sufficient income to\ncontinue paying on all the delinquent debts. Because of his dedicated recent efforts to\nestablish financial responsibility, it is unlikely that the magnitude of financial difficulties\nwill recur or that there is any doubt about his current reliability or good judgment. This\npotentially mitigating condition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems arose from his wife\u2019s irresponsibility and his unemployment. When\nApplicant learned about the situation, he returned home and immediately started paying\ncreditors. He acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. He had to stop\npaying his delinquent debts because he pays $1,500 a month for civil support to his\nwife.  I find this potentially mitigating condition fully applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This partially applies. Applicant\u2019s plan to pay\nall the delinquent bills was disrupted because he became unemployed in March 2008.\nHe is being considered for a position and will continue to search for employment so that\nhe can resume paying the delinquent debts. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant contacted a credit company to help with the financial\ncrisis. He did not like their manner. He also sought help from a business manager.\nWhile unemployed, he will not be a candidate for a home equity loan. He plans to\ncontinue paying all debts despite the fact that his wife incurred them without his\nknowledge. He is not shirking from his responsibility. The financial problems were\ncaused by his wife and his current unemployment and not frivolous spending. I conclude\nthis potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that the alleged\ndebts were his wife\u2019s but he understands that legally he is responsible for them through\nthe marriage. He did not have knowledge of many of them.  I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that under the whole\nperson, there is sufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant retired from the Navy after 31 years of service. He was deployed and\nout of the country for the majority of that time. He did not have any financial concerns or\nissues. He held a top secret clearance. After his retirement, he worked for a defense\ncontractor and maintained his security clearance without incident.\nApplicant had no knowledge that any financial problems existed until he received\na phone call from his daughter alerting him that his wife left the home and his daughter\nhad no idea where she was. Applicant immediately left the assignment abroad and\nreturned home. He found bags of unpaid bills in the home. Due to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s\nfinancial irresponsibility, Applicant had many delinquent accounts. He immediately\nbegan paying the creditors. He found that his mortgage payment was not made for\napproximately ten months and he paid the $11,000. Applicant paid many medical bills\nthat had not been addressed, including a $1,000 bill for his daughter\u2019s orthodontist.\nApplicant had to leave his job requiring him to travel abroad so that he could be\nhome and take care of his daughter who is finishing high school. Thus, his income was\nnot as lucrative as prior. In March 2008, he lost his current job through no fault of his\nown. \n\n8\nHe is court ordered to pay his wife who left the home a monthly sum of $1,500.\nHe has appealed that amount. His plan to pay all the remaining debts is derailed due to\nhis current unemployment. He will resume payments when he is employed. Also,\nApplicant will have more income if his appeal is successful to modify the civil court order\nof $1,500 a month to his wife. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

See Tr. at 56.  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 26, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 50-year-old production\nmanager for a defense contractor who  served in the U.S. Air Force from 1975 until 1985.  Following\nhis discharge, he went to work for the Air Force in a civilian capacity for the next 12 years, after\nwhich he became employed in the private sector.  In 1977 he was cited and charged with illegal\npossession of alcohol.  \u201cHe had consumed a can of beer on the base in 1977 and was still holding\nthe beer can in the driver\u2019s seat when he was stopped by local . . . police.\u201d  Decision at 2.  In 1984,\nApplicant was detained by base police for driving under the influence of alcohol following a golf\ncompetition, for which he received nonjudicial punishment.  The punishment consisted of a fine.\nApplicant\u2019s installation commander ordered him not to operate a vehicle on base for a year.\nApplicant\u2019s commander also vacated a previously imposed suspended reduction in grade.  As a\nconsequence of this misconduct, Applicant was found ineligible to reenlist.  \nApplicant was charged with and convicted of two more incidents of driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol, once in 1998 and again in 2006.  Applicant attends Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) meetings regularly but did not provide evidence of his progress, such as \u201cattendance reports,\nchips commemorating his sustained abstinence, and endorsements from a sponsor and friends . . .\u201d\nDecision at 5.  Applicant has never sought a professional evaluation from a physician or therapist\nfor any alcohol problems.\nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  Applicant\nchallenges certain findings of the Judge.  For example, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in his\ntreatment of the nonjudicial punishment action taken against him.  He states that he never attended\na golf competition in 1984 and that there was no alcohol involved in the facts underlying the\nvacation of his suspended reduction in grade.  Applicant\u2019s argument has merit.  The Board notes the\nfollowing record evidence:  In 1984, Applicant attended a party following an Air Force maintenance\nsquadron competition.    The party took place on base.  Applicant drank beer at this party and, as he\n1\n\nSee 10 U.S.C. \u00b6 911, which prohibits any person subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice from operating\n2\na vehicle \u201cwhile drunk.\u201d   \u201cDrunk\u201d means \u201cany intoxication which is sufficient sensibly to impair the rational and full\nexercise of the mental and physical faculties[.]\u201d   United States v. Bull, 14 C.M.R. 53 at 56 (Court of Military Appeals\n1954).  \nThe Board notes that the only documentary reference to the Article 15 for drunk driving is found on the\n3\nvacation of suspended punishment form for the later offense of violating an order.  This may have contributed to the\nJudge\u2019s apparent assumption that the two adverse actions addressed the same underlying misconduct.   \nApplicant also claims that he had held a security clearance since 1976 rather than 1977, as the Judge found;\n4\nthat he attended a 1998 NCAA basketball game with a friend rather than with his wife; and that his 2006 arrest was for\ndriving under the influence of alcohol rather than for driving while intoxicated.  Any error in these findings is de minimis.\n3\nwas driving home, Air Force Security Police detained him on suspicion of drunk driving.   Tr. at 57.\n2\nAs a result, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice in May 1984.  The punishment consisted of a reduction to the grade of Sergeant and\nforfeiture of $250.00 pay per month for two months.  However, the reduction in grade was suspended\nfor six months.  Government Exhibit (GE) 6, Record of Vacation of Suspended Nonjudicial\nPunishment, September 10, 1984.  In addition to the nonjudicial punishment, Applicant\u2019s installation\ncommander ordered him not to operate his car on base for a period of one year.  Tr. at 57.  During\nthe period of suspension, Applicant violated the installation commander\u2019s order not to operate his\ncar on base.  The record evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s apparent finding that alcohol was\ninvolved in this event.  As a consequence of violating the installation commander\u2019s order,\nApplicant\u2019s squadron commander vacated the suspended reduction in grade, reducing him from Staff\nSergeant to Sergeant in September 1984.  As a further consequence of the original nonjudicial\npunishment action, Applicant was denied eligibility for reenlistment in the Air Force.  GE 5,\nReenlistment Ineligibility, May 31, 1984.  Examined in light of the record, the Judge\u2019s decision\nappears to treat the Article 15 and the subsequent vacation proceeding as having arisen from the\nsame set of facts, which is error.   Applicant also points to other findings which he believes to be\n3\nerroneous.  For example, the Judge stated that Applicant was introduced to alcohol while in high\nschool, although the Board has not found record evidence in support of this assertion.  He also\npersuasively argues that there is no record evidence for the Judge\u2019s finding that he was in the driver\u2019s\nseat of a car when he was cited for illegal possession of alcohol in 1977.   \n4\n  \nHaving concluded that the Judge\u2019s findings contain errors, the Board must now consider\nwhether they are harmful. The Board notes that, despite his errors concerning the 1984 drunk driving\nincident and subsequent disciplinary action, the Judge correctly interpreted the record as establishing\nfour incidents of alcohol-related misconduct between 1977 and 2006.   That is, these errors did not\nlead him to treat Applicant as having committed more misconduct than the record would sustain.\nIn examining the Analysis portion of the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board notes that the Judge focused\nhis attention on (1) the recurrent nature of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses; (2) Applicant\u2019s\nrelapses following periods of light to moderate alcohol consumption; (3) a paucity of record evidence\ncorroborating the extent of his participation in AA; (4) and what the Judge concluded was a\nrelatively short period of sustained abstinence following the most recent DUI.   These matters are\n\nSee  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\n5\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)  \n4\nbased upon substantial record evidence or are reasonable conclusions from such evidence.   The\n5\nrecord evidence and the Judge\u2019s decision provide no basis to conclude that, had the Judge not made\nthe errors about the 1984 incident, or the other errors described above, he would have evaluated\nApplicant\u2019s case in a different way or reached a different final decision.  Therefore, we conclude that\nthe errors in the Judge\u2019s findings are harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 06-07247 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb.\n13, 2008).   \nTurning to the second issue which Applicant has raised, the Judge has drawn a rational\nconnection between the facts found and his ultimate adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR\nCase No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United\nStates v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines,\nInc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance\u201d is\nsustainable on this record.  Decision at 8.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffery D.

A hearing was held on April 30, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether\nit would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny,\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.

He had\nconsumed a can of beer on the base in 1977 and was still holding the beer can in the\ndriver\u2019s seat when he was stopped by local college police (R.T., at 68-70). Police\ncharged him with illegal possession of alcohol and fined him (R.T., at 68).\nIn 1984, Applicant had participated in a major AF golf competition and had\nconsumed eight or nine beers at an ensuing party before heading home.  While headed\nback to base housing, he inadvertently pulled onto the base facility (see ex. A), where\nhe was pulled over by base police (R.T., at 60-62, 92).  The base police asked him to\nstep out of his vehicle and arrested him for violating a command order not to drive on\n\n3\nthe base facility (R.T., at 62).  Once out of the vehicle, the base police asked him to\nsubmit to a breath test.  When their Breathalyzer would not work, they escorted him, to\nthe base dispensary for administering a blood test (R.T., at 92).  While not completely\ncertain of his test results, he believes he registered over the limits to show alcohol\nintoxication.\n Subsequently, Applicant accepted non-judicial punishment and was fined and\nrestricted to no driving on base for a year.  Applicant says he had inadvertently\ndisobeyed an order not to drive on the base (R.T., at 68).  Applicant insists he had\nmisconstrued the boundaries of the AF base when he approached the guard house on\nthe base (R.T., at 66-67).  He had assumed incorrectly that the base commenced at the\nhighway.  His claims while sincere were not convincing to the convening authority who\npresided over his NJP appearance and do not alter judgment lapses associated with his\ndriving while under the influence of alcohol.   \nApplicant realized after the incident that he should not have been driving home in\nthe evening of 1984.  After playing in the AF golf tournament 36 holes of golf and\ndrinking at a squadron celebration that followed (R.T., at 56-57), he was in no position\nto drive safely.  But at the time he felt he could drive safely and did.  Applicant submitted\nto a Breathalyzer at the dispensary; he is not sure of the test results but believes he was\nprobably over the limit  (R.T., at 92).\nAs a result of this 1984 alcohol-related incident, his command vacated an earlier\nsuspension of an order issued to Applicant not to drive on the base (see ex. 6).   Based\non the initiated Article 15 proceedings, Applicant was notified in May 1984 of his\nineligibility to reenlist in the AF (see ex. 5). The incident also prompted his vacation of\nhis acceptance into a previously approved OCS program (R.T., at 57-58).  As a result,\nApplicant asked his command for early release from his AF enlistment to pursue his\neducation goals (R.T., at 71-72).  His request was granted, and Applicant received an\nhonorable discharge in January 1985 (R.T., at 73). \nBetween 1987 and 1997, Applicant was enrolled in a college engineering\nprogram at a respectable institution of higher learning.  He is credited with earning a\nbachelors of science degree in electrical engineering from a reputable university after\n17 years of study (see ex. 1).  His alcohol consumption was fairly moderate during this\nperiod: maybe two beers one weekend a month during outside barbeques (R.T., at 95-\n96).  \nFollowing expiration of his probationary period, Applicant continued to consume\nalcohol on a moderate basis.  He estimates that he typically consumed no more than\ntwo to three beers with friends during weekend dinners or barbeques.  He practiced this\nmoderate level of drinking for over eight years between 1998 and 2006, and never\nattended bars or drank to intoxication during this eight-year span.  What little free time\nhe had he spent with his daughters as their soccer coach, swimming instructor, and all\naround supporter of their school activities.\n\n4\nWhile attending an NCAA final four basketball game with his wife in 1998,\nApplicant consumed eight or nine  beers.  When returning home after the game, he was\npulled over by police for a suspected improper lane change (see ex. 2; R.T., at 54-55,\n90).  The officer who stopped him asked him if he had been drinking.  When Applicant\nresponded affirmatively, the officer asked him to submit to a field sobriety test and\nBreathalyzer (ex. 2). Applicant failed both tests and was arrested for DuI and\nincarcerated overnight.  He pled no contest in court and was sentenced to six months\nprobation, fined $450.00, ordered to work 80 hours of community service, enroll in a\ndriver education course, and surrender his driver\u2019s license (see ex. 2; R.T., at 90-91).\nHe subsequently petitioned the court for an occupational driver\u2019s license, which the\ncourt approved (R.T., at 91).  \nIn April 2006, Applicant was involved in his fourth alcohol-related incident.\nApplicant and his wife had been out dancing and consumed too much alcohol before\ndeparting for home.  When stopped by the arresting officer, the officer asked Applicant\nto step out of his vehicle (see ex. 3).  In disembarking from his vehicle, the officer noted\nthat Applicant was unsteady on his feet (ex. 3).  Upon observing his behavior and\nfinding  an open container in his vehicle, she asked him to submit to a Breathalyzer test\n(R.T., at 80-81).  Applicant declined the officer\u2019s request and was arrested.  \nAt hearing, Applicant questioned the officer\u2019s character (see ex. C) and her\ncharacterization of his  clumsy reactions on his feet after exiting his vehicle (R.T., at 41).\nHe attributes his apparent clumsy movements to banging his knee on the hitch of his\ntruck.  This is a plausible explanation of his apparent clumsy footwork.  However,\nneither this explanation nor his claimed request to talk to a lawyer adequately explain\nthe likely effects of his prior alcohol consumption during and after his golf tournament\n(i.e., four to six beers while playing 36 holes of golf and three beers and a margarita at\nthe reception afterwards) or his failure to submit to a requested field sobriety test at the\nscene or a Breathalyzer back at the station (compare ex. 3 with R.T. ,at 42-53, 88-89).\n At his June 2006 court appearance, Applicant pled no contest and was\nsentenced to 18 months probation, fined $700.00, ordered to enroll in both a victim\nimpact panel and a 16-week alcohol intervention course, (which included weekly\nmeetings with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and attendance reports) and directed to\nperform 24 hours of community service (see ex. 2; R.T., at 80).  Because his driver\u2019s\nlicense was automatically suspended for two years as the result of his DuI conviction,\nhe sought and obtained court approval of an occupational driver\u2019s license for the\nduration of his two-year driver\u2019s license suspension period (ex. 2).  One of the\nconditions the court set for Applicant\u2019s occupational driver\u2019s license was the installation\nof an ignition interlocking breathalyzer device in his vehicle that Applicant must use\nevery time he uses his vehicle (ex. 2).  \nSince his June 2006 incident, Applicant does not party or attend bars and\nassures he has not consumed alcohol of any kind (R.T., at 97-98).  Instead of alcohol,\nhe assures that he and his wife only consume O\u2019Doul\u2019s non-alcoholic beverages (R.T.,\nat 99).  He has never had the impression he was dependent on alcohol.  Nonetheless,\n\n5\nhe has continued to attend open AA meetings, which are a condition of his court-\nconditioned probation (R.T., at 96-97).  He provides signed monthly attendance reports\nto his probation officer (R.T., at 96-97), and expects to continue his AA meetings for the\nduration of his probation (R.T., at 97).  He does find the friendships and support he\nreceives from his AA participation to be very helpful; even though he does not admit to\nbeing an alcoholic  (R.T., at 97).  \nBecause a core tent of AA is acknowledging one\u2019s alcoholic status, it is difficult to\ngauge Applicant\u2019s commitments to AA. He acknowledge\u2019s AA\u2019s alcoholic admission\ntenet, but avoids closed meetings where testimonials and acknowledged alcoholism are\nexpected. Furnished attendance reports, chips commemorating his sustained\nabstinence, and endorsements from a sponsor and friends familiar with his AA\nattendance would have provided helpful corroboration. Professional evaluations of his\nalcohol status could have been useful, too, in determining his vulnerabilities (if any) to\nalcohol.  Applicant indicated, though, that he has never sought a professional evaluation\nfrom a credentialed physician or therapist for any alcohol problems (R.T., at 84).  \nWithout any professional evaluation of Applicant or corroboration of his AA\nattendance and benefits derived from his participation, the most that can be inferred\nfrom Applicant\u2019s accounts is that he has attended AA meetings since being placed on\nprobation in June 2006.  It is less than clear whether Applicant (once his probation is\nofficially concluded and his driving privileges are restored) will continue with his AA\nmeetings, maintain his self-imposed abstinence, and avert any recurrent alcohol-related\narrests, lapses or slips.  Based on his testimony, his probation has been extended\nseveral months (from December 2007 to May 2008 (compare ex. 2 with R.T., at 81),\nand he still has a restricted driver\u2019s license (R.T., at 81).  Reasons for his probation\nextension are not specifically cited, but seem likely to be associated with his license\nsuspension.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n\n6\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern. \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to\ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d See AG \u00b6 21.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge\ncannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is an accomplished production manager for a defense contractor with a\nhistory of recurrent alcohol-related arrests (four in all over a 30-year period) and\nsometimes abusive alcohol consumption over a 30-year period. His alcohol history\nincludes four alcohol-related incidents between 1977 and 2006.  Applicant\u2019s exhibited\nalcohol abuse raises security concerns covered by Guideline G of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines. \nApplicant\u2019s four alcohol-related arrests covered in the SOR raise major concerns\nover his risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  On the strength of the evidence presented,\nseveral disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol\nconsumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from\n\n7\nwork, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual\nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d 22\u00a9), \u201chabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and 22(d),\n\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist,\nor psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\u201d \nDespite the recurrent pattern of his alcohol-related arrests (four over a 30-year\nperiod), Applicant does not believe he is alcoholic and attends AA open meetings,\nwhere admitted alcoholism and personal testimonials are not expected.  Further, he has\nnever sought an evaluation from a credentialed physician or licensed substance abuse\ncounselor and provides no corroborative support of his AA attendance.  Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to provide any corroborative support of his AA and abstinence commitments are\nimportant considerations in determining what weight to assign to Applicant\u2019s\nrehabilitation claims.  See ISCR Case 02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006); ISCR Case\n01-20579, at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004). \nStill troubling and of ongoing security concern is Applicant\u2019s history of recurrent\nrelapses following periods of light to moderate alcohol consumption, and his lack of any\nextended period of sustained abstinence.  While Applicant provides assurances of his\nsincere commitment this time to maintain his current track of sobriety with the help of\nAA, his sustained abstinence efforts are still relatively new (about two years), and\nseveral months short of his estimated completion of his probation.  Moreover,\nApplicant\u2019s driving privileges are still partially suspended, and will remain so for at least\na couple of additional months. This is not to suggest his renewed commitments to\nsobriety do not reflect positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.\nWith his long history of alcohol-related incidents, and drinking abuses associated\nwith these incidents, relapses following probation and, and still relatively short time in\nsustained abstinence following his commitment to abstinence with AA support in July\n2006, it is still too soon to make safe predictions that he is at no foreseeable risk to a\nrecurrent alcohol-related incident.  Faced with similar recurrent alcohol-related arrests\nover a considerable period of time, our Appeal Board has expressed reluctance to make\nsafe predictive judgments about an applicant\u2019s ability to avoid abusive incidents in the\nfuture without strong probative evidence of sustained recovery, aided by positive\nprofessional reinforcements.  See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008);\nISCR Case No. 04-10799 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).\nTaking into account both Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his strong work\nrecord, the applicable guidelines and a whole person assessment of his most recent\nsobriety efforts (which have been roundly praised by his treatment counselors),\nconclusions warrant that his overall efforts, while encouraging, do not reflect sufficient\nevidence of sustained commitment to AA and its tenets of sobriety to convince he is no\nlonger at risk to recurrence.  In the past, he has enjoyed considerable periods of\nsobriety only to return to episodic drinking that involved alcohol-related incidents away\n\n8\nfrom work.  Because of this recurrent abuse problem, his earlier incidents cannot be\nconsidered isolated and unrelated to a pattern of abuse, despite their comparative age\nwhen considered separately.\nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make a convincing showing\nthat he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent\nproblems with judgment lapses related to alcohol.  Without a more seasoned record of\nsobriety to rely on, Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are simply not enough at this time to\nwarrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated\nwith such conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by the alcohol guideline of the SOR. \n In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, and the factors listed above, I make the\nfollowing formal findings:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSIDERATIONS):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1a through 1.e\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  Clearance is denied.\n                                  \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge:\nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that\nApplicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under the\nDrug Involvement and Personal Conduct adjudicative guidelines.  Pursuant to 50 U.S.C.\n435b, Section 3002, Applicant does not qualify for a security clearance, and his eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant executed and certified a Security Clearance Application (SF 86)\nelectronically on August 18, 2006.  He provided a signed certification of his SF-86 on\nAugust 22, 2007. On November 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder  Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). DOHA\u2019s\naction was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMarch 26, 2008\n\nApplicant also provided a signature to certify his responses on August 22, 2007.\n1\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 20, 2007.  In his answer,\nApplicant requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The\nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 24, 2008.  The\nFORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 5.  A copy of the FORM was\nprovided to Applicant on January 25, 2008, with instructions to submit any additional\ninformation and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on\nFebruary 28, 2008.  He filed a response to the FORM within the required time period.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s February 28, 2008 filing. On March 6,\n2008, the case was assigned to another DOHA administrative judge. On March 12,\n2008, the case was reassigned to me for a decision. I have marked Applicant\u2019s\nFebruary 28, 2008, response to the FORM as his Exhibit A, and I have admitted it to the\nrecord of this case.\nProcedural Issues\nSOR allegation 1.f. alleges a violation of 10 U.S.C. 986 because Applicant is a\npresent user and purchaser of marijuana, a controlled substance. On January 28, 2008,\nthe President approved the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008,\nwhich repealed 10 U.S.C. 986 and replaced it with 50 U.S.C. 435b, Section 3002. The\nnewly enacted statute states that a person who is an unlawful user of a controlled\nsubstance or an addict cannot be granted a security clearance by any federal agency.\nSince the prohibitions of 10 U.S.C. 986 and 50 U.S.C.435b, Section 3002 are the same,\nthere is no prejudice to Applicant and he has received adequate notice of the\nprohibition. In this decision, the prohibition will be discussed under 50 U.S.C. 435b,\nSection 3002 and not 10 U.S.C. 986.\n  \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H,\nDrug Involvement, and one allegation of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted five allegations under Guideline H and\ndenied one Guideline H allegation, with explanation.  He also denied the one allegation\nunder Guideline E.  (Item 3; Ex. A.)  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact.\nOn March 22, 2008, Applicant will be 24 years old.  He is single and employed as\na software engineer by a Federal contractor.  He holds bachelor of science degrees in\napplied mathematics and physics. (Item 4.)\nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) and certified his\nanswers electronically on August 18, 2006.  Section 24 on the SF-86 is titled \u201cYour Use\n1\nof Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity.\u201d In response to Section 24, Applicant admitted illegal\nuse of marijuana from March 2005 to June 2006. He estimated he had used marijuana\neight times during the fifteen month period from March 2005 to June 2006. (Item 4.)\n\n3\nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator and provided a\nstatement under oath on February 23, 2007. In the interview, Applicant admitted using\nmarijuana with his girlfriend during the period beginning in June 2006 and ending in\nDecember 2006.  He stated he would continue to use marijuana if it was presented to\nhim in a social setting, and he speculated he might continue to smoke marijuana\nmonthly or every two months depending on his social contacts. He stated he was in\ncontrol of his use of marijuana and avoided smoking too much at a time. He stated he\nwas comfortable using marijuana while holding a security clearance. While he\nrecognized that the use of marijuana was illegal, he did not think there was a difference\nbetween the use of alcohol and the use of marijuana.  Applicant stated that his twin\nbrother smoked marijuana about three times a week.  Applicant has frequent contact\nwith his brother, and he once bought marijuana from his twin brother\u2019s friend. (Item 5 at\n3-4.)\nIn September 2007, Applicant provided a sworn statement in which he admitted\nmarijuana use approximately once a week from June 2007 to July 2007.  He stated he\nhad not smoked marijuana in August 2007 but expected to continue to smoke marijuana\nabout once a month in the future.  (Item 5 at 5-7.)\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he was disqualified from holding\na security clearance under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 because he was ending\nhis use of marijuana immediately.  He attached the following statement to his answer to\nthe SOR: \nI intend to cease using marijuana from now (December 20, 2007) until at\nleast the expiration/termination of any security clearance I may be\ngranted.  I also will not use any other illegal substances.  I understand that\nany usage would likely result in the termination of any security clearance I\nmay possess. \nI also indicate my willingness to sign a more formal statement if that is\nrequired.\n(Answer to SOR at 2.)\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that his use of an illegal drug after\ncompleting a security clearance application and his statement that he would feel\ncomfortable using an illegal drug while holding a security clearance raised any security\nissues about his reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness under the Personal Conduct\nadjudicative guideline.  (Answer to SOR at 1.)\nIn his response to the FORM, dated February 28, 2008, Applicant stated that he\nhad stopped using marijuana when he prepared his response to the SOR, which he\nsubmitted to DOHA on December 20, 2007.  He stated he had not used or purchased\nany illegal substances since responding to the SOR. He stated he intended to avoid all\nillegal drugs during the time that he held a security clearance.  (Response to FORM at\n1.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) disqualified a person from being granted a security\nclearance if he or she was \u201can unlawful user of, or . . . [was] addicted to, a controlled\n\n5\nsubstance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.\n802)).\u201d  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) was in effect at the time Applicant\u2019s SOR was issued and\nserved on him.  On January 28, 2008, the President signed Public Law 110-181, which,\nin pertinent part, repealed 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 and replaced it with a new statute, 50 U.S.C.\n435b, Section 3002.  The new statute also prohibits granting a security clearance to an\nindividual who is an addict or an unlawful user of a controlled substance. The new\nstatute applies in this case. \nAnalysis\n           Guideline H,  Drug Involvement\nAn individual\u2019s use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug raises\nquestions of reliability and trustworthiness because drug use or misuse can impair\njudgment and raise questions about the person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24.  Guideline H defines drugs as mood\nand behavior altering substances. . . . Drugs include: (1) Drugs, materials, and other\nchemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24(a)(1)\nand \u00b6 24(a)(2).  The Guideline further defines drug abuse as the illegal use of drug or\nuse of a legal drug in an manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nGuideline H, \u00b6 24(b).\nApplicant admitted using marijuana, an illegal drug, with varying frequency, from\nMarch 2005 through December 2007. He used marijuana after submitting his\napplication for a security clearance in August 2006, after his interview with an\nauthorized investigator in February 2007, and after receiving the SOR.  He stated  in his\nanswer to the SOR that , as of December 20, 2007, he would no longer use marijuana\nand would not use it again until he no longer held a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use spanned approximately 2 \u00bd years of his post-college\nprofessional life. During that time, he also purchased marijuana. Applicant\u2019s statements,\nwhen read as a whole, fail to demonstrate that he has clearly and convincingly\ncommitted to discontinue his use of marijuana.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC)\n25(a), (DC) 25(c), and (DC) 25(h) of Guideline H, and the provisions of 50 U.S.C. 435b,\nSection 3002. DC 25(a) reads: any drug abuse. DC 25(c) reads: illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia.  DC25(h) reads: expressed intent to continue illegal\ndrug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use. Pursuant\nto 50 U.S.C. 435b, Section 3002, an applicant who is an unlawful user of a controlled\nsubstance may not be granted access to classified information.  \nSeveral Mitigating Conditions (MC) under Guideline H might be applicable to\nApplicant\u2019s case.  If the drug abuse behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\n\nSpecific examples of demonstrated intent that might apply under MC26(b) are as follows: (1) disassociation\n2\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) A signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. \nIn the FORM, the Government alleged that DC 16(d) also applied to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  I conclude\n3\nthat DC 16(d) is inapplicable, since the credible adverse information about Applicant\u2019s drug use was alleged\nas disqualifying conduct under Guideline H.  DC 16(d) addresses \u201ccredible adverse information that is not\n6\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then MC 26(a)\nmight apply.  If Applicant intended not to abuse drugs in the future and demonstrated\nthat intent as specified in the Guideline, then MC 26 (b) might apply.   Additionally, drug\n2\nabuse that is of security concern can be mitigated under MC 26(d) by satisfactory\ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to\nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s marijuana abuse began in about 2005 and\ncontinued until at least December 20, 2007. Thus, his drug abuse is recent, and\nApplicant provided no credible evidence to corroborate his assertion that he no longer\nuses drugs and has no intent to use them in the future while holding a security\nclearance. Applicant\u2019s brother continues to use marijuana, and Applicant has on-going\ncontact with him. Applicant failed to provide evidence he had satisfactorily completed a\nprescribed drug treatment program. While Applicant provided a statement that he would\nnot use drugs while he held a security clearance, he also limited his commitment to\nabstinence to the duration of any security clearance granted to him. Applicant\npresumably felt free to begin using illegal drugs again when he no longer held a security\nclearance. Applicant failed to credibly demonstrate his intent not to abuse drugs again in\nthe future.  None of the Guideline H MCs apply to Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nApplicant continued to use an illegal drug after submitting a security clearance\napplication, after an interview with an authorized investigator, and after receiving the\nSOR.  Further, he stated to an authorized investigator that he would be comfortable\nusing marijuana while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s behavior demonstrates\nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and lack of trustworthiness.  His personal conduct\nraises doubts about his ability to follow rules and regulations for the protection of\nclassified information. Moreover, his illegal drug use makes him vulnerable to\nexploitation, manipulation or duress.  His drug use, if known, could affect his personal\nand professional standing. \nA security concern under Guideline E is raised when an individual demonstrates\nquestionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  See\nGuideline E, \u00b6 15. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s conduct raises a security concern under\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 16(e)(1), which reads: personal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.    \n3\n\nexplicitly covered under any other guideline. . . .\u201d \n7\n     Under Guideline E, there are two Mitigating Conditions (MC) that might be\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case. If Applicant has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur, then MC 17(d) might\napply.  If the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, then MC 17(e) might apply.\n       Applicant has indicated he would forego marijuana use while he held a security\nclearance. However, he continued his illegal drug use after applying for a security\nclearance.  By his own admission, he continued to use marijuana until he prepared his\nanswer to the SOR. Applicant has not sought counseling for unreliable conduct, nor has\nhe taken any other positive steps to ensure that he will not use drugs in the future.  His\nstatement that he will abstain from marijuana use in the future is speculative and lacks\ncredibility when viewed in the context of his recent behavior.  I conclude that MC 17(d)\ndoes not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\n        Applicant\u2019s pursuit of illegal drug use after applying for a security clearance makes\nhim vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress and the subsequent compromise\nof classified material, should he be granted a security clearance. He failed to\ndemonstrate that he had taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities\nderiving from the personal conduct that results in his use of drugs.  I conclude that MC\n17(e) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  No other MCs under Guideline E\napply. \n            \n          Whole Person Concept\n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI carefully considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nadjudicative Guidelines E and H in light of the whole person concept and the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish recent illegal drug\ninvolvement and an absence of demonstrated resolve to cease illegal drug use\nunconditionally. Applicant\u2019s behavior raises concerns about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. While Applicant asserted he had not used illegal drugs since preparing\nhis Answer to the SOR, he failed to demonstrate credible rehabilitation and resolve to\navoid  illegal drugs in the future. \nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states\nthat an administrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust\nconsider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have\nconsidered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the\nwhole person concept of the Directive. \nI have also weighed Applicant\u2019s drug behavior in light of 50 U.S.C. 435b, Section\n3002.  Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs is recent, and, while he recently expressed an\nintention to cease illegal drug use in the future, he did so by limiting his abstinence to\nthe length of time he would hold a security clearance, thereby suggesting that his\npromised avoidance of drugs was limited and conditional. Applicant has failed to\nmitigate his recent use of marijuana and presents an unacceptable security risk.  I\nconclude that, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 435b, Section 3002, Applicant is an unlawful user\nof a controlled substance and must be denied a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n____________________________\nJOAN CATON ANTHONY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 22, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated August 14, 2006.  On March 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 20, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 3, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on May 15, 2008.  A notice\nof hearing was issued on June 16, 2008, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on\nJuly 1, 2008.  The Government presented seven exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection. The Applicant presented\ntwo exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, which were received without\nobjection. The Applicant also testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript\n\n2\nof the hearing (Tr.) on July 16, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 33 years old, single, and has an Associate Degree in Electronics\nEngineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Air Traffic Control\nCommunications Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant was arrested, charged and convicted on nine separate occasions\nfor various criminal violations, beginning in 1992, and continuing until at least 2003.\nThe Applicant was arrested in November 1992, and charged with (1) Burglary.\nThe Applicant and several other kids were breaking into cars.  He was found guilty of\nReceiving Known Stolen Property and was sentenced to serve time in Juvenile Hall.\nThe Applicant was a sixteen year old minor at the time of the offense.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 2).   \n \nThe Applicant was arrested in March 1994, and charged with (1) Under the\nInfluence of a Controlled Substance, and (2) Felony Drunk Driving.  He was found guilty\nof Count (2) was sentenced to serve two days in jail, and was placed on 36 months\nprobation.  The Applicant had been using marijuana at the time of the offense.  He was\neighteen years of age at the time.  (See Government Exhibit 2).\nThe Applicant was arrested in March 1998, and charged with (1) Driving Under\nthe Influence, and (2) Driving Under the Influence with BAC .08% or More.  The\nApplicant was driving home after having consumed alcohol at a party when he was\npulled over by the police.  Pursuant to a plea bargain, he pled guilty to a lesser included\noffense of Reckless Driving and Counts (1) and (2) were dismissed.  He was sentenced\nto seven days in jail, fined $100.00, and was placed on 36 months of probation. (See\nGovernment Exhibit 5).  \nIn April 1998, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Use/Under the\nInfluence of a Controlled Substance, and (2) Possession of a Controlled Substance.\nThe Applicant was a passenger in a car and had been using methamphetamine at the\ntime of the offense.  He pled nolo contendere to Count (2) and was sentenced to 30\ndays in jail, fined $110.00, and was placed on 36 months of probation.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 2). \nIn May 1998, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the\nInfluence; (2) Driving While License Suspended for Driving Under the Influence, and (3)\nPossession Open Container While Driving.  He pled nolo contendere to Counts (1) and\n(2), and Count (3) was dismissed.  He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, fined $1,224.00,\nordered to attend State approved Alcohol Program for Multiple Offenders, his driver\u2019s\n\n3\nlicense was restricted for 18 months, and he was placed in probation for 36 months.\n(See Government Exhibit 5).\nIn October 1998, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Unauthorized Entry, and (2)\nDisorderly Conduct of a Person Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs.  The police\nfound the Applicant out in the road in front of someone yard.  The Applicant explained\nthat he was drinking at a bar and he believes that someone slipped something into his\ndrink because when he woke up he was in a Sheriff\u2019s car.  (Tr. p. 31).  He pled guilty to\nboth counts and was sentenced to one day in jail, fined $110.00, ordered to complete a\nweekly Alcohol Program for one year, and was placed on 26 months probation.\nIn March 2001, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Inflict Corporal\nInjury on Spouse/Cohabitant.  He pled nolo contendere to a misdemeanor charge, was\nsentenced to 20 days in jail, fined $110.00, ordered to complete 52-week Anger\nManagement Program, and was placed on 36 months probation.  (See Government\nExhibits 2, 3 and 5).  \nIn August 2002, he was arrested and charged with (1) Disorderly Conduct, and\n(2) Under the Influence of a Controlled Substance (Methamphetamine).  He was found\nguilty and sentenced to serve 30 days in jail on the weekends.  The Applicant contends\nthat he was not under the influence of any illegal drug at the time of the offense and had\nstopped using methamphetamine in 1998.  (See Government Exhibit 2 and Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit).\nThe Applicant was last arrested in August 2003, and charged with(1) Inflict\nCorporal Injury on Spouse/Cohabitant, a felony, and (2) Battery on Spouse/Cohabitant.\nHe pled guilty Count (2) and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, fined $150.00, ordered to\ncomplete 52-week Domestic Violence Battery\u2019s Program and he was placed on 36\nmonths of probation.  The Applicant explained that he was trying to leave the house and\nhis girlfriend tried to prevent him from doing so, when an altercation ensued.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 3 and 5).\nThe Applicant testified that since 2003, he has matured.  He has rehabilitated\nhimself by going to church and Alcoholic Anonymous meetings.  He no longer\nassociates with anyone who uses illegal drugs.  His life has greatly improved, and he\nnow has a good woman and happy children.  He is content with his life now that he no\nlonger uses illegal drugs.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed a Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing dated August 14, 2006.  Question 24(a) of the same questionnaire asked\nthe Applicant if since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, he\nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine,\nhashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc), amphetamines, depressants\nbarbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc), hallucinogens, (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?\u201d.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This\n\n4\nwas a false answer.  He failed to disclose his drug use in 2002 related to his charge in\nAugust 2002, (set forth in 1(h) of the SOR), and his illegal use of drugs in marijuana in\nAugust 2004, during a camping trip with a friend.  The Applicant stated that he meant to\nanswer the question, \u201cYES\u201d.  He gave no excuse as to why he did not reveal this\ninformation in response to the question.  (See Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR).  \nBased upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified\nhis Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing dated August 14, 2006.  The\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification in his security clearance application, is a violation of\nTitle 18 of the United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.\n \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s manager and a coworker attest\nto the fact that the Applicant is responsible, trustworthy, hardworking, diligent and\nmature.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\n\n6\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct and personal conduct that demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J), and dishonesty (Guideline E).\nThe totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness\non the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines J and E of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  The Applicant has an eleven\nyear history of criminal conduct that includes nine arrests.  Although his most recent\narrest occurred in 2003, over five years ago, he lied about his drug involvement on his\nSecurity Clearance Application as recently as 2006.  By doing so, he committed\nviolations of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.  This will be discussed further\nunder Guideline E, below.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct is very troubling.  He\nwas not honest with the Government in answering questions about his drug history and\ndid not disclose his most recent drug use in 2004.  There is no reasonable excuse as to\nwhy he did not tell the truth about his drug history.  It is obvious that he intentionally\nconcealed this information from the Government, hoping to minimize the seriousness of\n\n7\nthe matter.  Consequently, his dishonesty with the Government concerning this matter is\nunacceptable.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty\nof clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an\nApplicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his\npersonal background.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under\nGuidelines E or J apply. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.     \nThe Applicant is now on the right path.  He is living on the straight and narrow\nand abiding by the laws.  However, given his extensive past criminal history, more time\nin needed in rehabilitation to ensure the Government that he will not revert to his old\ncriminal ways.  Furthermore, the Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy,\nand does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E\n(Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.    \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 8, 2006, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions or Standard Form (SF 86). On September 26, 2006, he submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86).1 On March 24, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \n \n1  Form Items 4 and 5 are his two SF 86s.  \n \n2  Form Item 1 (SOR), is the source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated \notherwise. \n \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified \nand revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn May 13, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated June 5, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.4 Applicant did not provide a written response to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 15, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.k \nand 1.n. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l \u2013 1.p because the debts were paid or he is making \npayments on the debts. He denied owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.n and 1.o are duplicates of the same debt. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old truck driver working for a defense contractor.5 He \nmarried in 1981 and divorced in 1988. He married the second time in 1990. His children \nor stepchildren were born in 1979, 1980, 1983 and 1984. He did not serve in the \nmilitary. He has no police record. He has not used illegal drugs in the last seven years, \nand has never used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position. He has never been fired \nfrom a job or quit under adverse circumstances. He has never had any alcohol-related \ncounseling or treatment. \n \n \n3  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4  The DOHA transmittal letter is dated June 10, 2008. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA \ntransmittal letter on June 23, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days \nafter receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n5  Items 4 and 5 (2006 SF 86s) are the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated \notherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nOn November 28, 2006, an Investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement interviewed Applicant (Item 8). Applicant promised to contact all of his \ncreditors listed on a credit report dated October 17, 2006, and make arrangements to \nsettle all of his outstanding debts as soon as possible.  However, some of the SOR \ndebts were listed on the October 17, 2006, credit report and remain unresolved. \n \nHe admitted responsibility for the 12 delinquent debts he admitted in the following \nSOR paragraphs: 1.a ($124), 1.b ($310), 1.c ($241), 1.d ($85), 1.e ($105), 1.f ($150), \n1.g ($9,244), 1.h ($537), 1.i ($89), 1.j ($100), 1.k ($234), and 1.n ($91,134).6  The \nfederal tax lien in SOR \u00b6 1.n was entered on January 23, 2007, and released on \nDecember 9, 2002 (Item 13 at 8). He did not explain why the federal tax lien in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n was released, but it was included as an item in his September 2002 bankruptcy. \nApplicant said he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l ($738), and 1.p ($201). The debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l were listed in his bankruptcy filing (Item 10). He denied the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.q ($737) because he did not owe it. He is making payments on the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($15,387). He did not provide any proof of payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.m. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o ($74,081) is a duplication of 1.n ($91,134).   \n \nThe record (Item 13) contains the following judgment and lien information: (1) \nIRS Lien for $1,967 entered in 1992 and released in 1997; (2) IRS Lien for $91,134 \nentered in 1997 and released in 2002; (3) IRS Lien for $1,434 entered in 1997; (4) IRS \nLien for $74,086 entered in 1998; (5) IRS Lien for $73,969 entered in 1998; (6) State \nTax Lien for $8,483 renewed in 2002; (7) State Tax Lien for $737 renewed in 2001 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.q); (8) Small Claims Judgment for $201 entered in 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.p); and (9) \nState Tax Lien for $15,387 entered in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.m).     \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2002, and his debts were \ndischarged on September 24, 2002 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.s). His liabilities in the \nbankruptcy were $125,135 (Item 10 at 1, 5). Applicant probably received financial \ncounseling in connection with his bankruptcy.  \n  \n \n On February 5, 2008, Applicant responded (Item 8) to numerous interrogatories \nabout the status of specific debts with a brief statement: \n \nI have not yet made arrangements on the medical bills that I owe.7 I have \nbeen working on getting my tax bills settled. As soon as I speak to the \nlocal tax representative and set up payments, I will then know how to best \nset up payments on my medical bills. . . . I will begin making payments on \nmy federal taxes on January 24, 2008.  \n \n \n6  Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this and the next paragraph is \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response (Item 3).  \n \n7  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.l are for medical debts. He paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nHe concluded his general statement about his debts, commenting that he has hired a \ntax consultant and begun arrangements to pay his tax debt. Attached to this response \nwas a statement from the IRS about an established payment plan of $200 monthly for \ntax years 1991 and 1992 until the specifics of the repayment plan could be completed \n(Item 8). As indicated previously, the IRS released his tax debts for 1991 and 1992 in \n2002. \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s 2006 budget showed a gross monthly salary of \n$5,933, deductions of $1,075, expenses of $1,352, debt payments of $1,339 and a net \nremainder of about $2,167 (Item 8 at 3-4). Monthly debt payments were for two \nvehicles, two student loans, and a home loan.  Id.  His budget did not detail any \npayments for creditors listed in the SOR.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d8 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \n \n8  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to \n \n9  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nDOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response. His 2002 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy listed \n$125,135 in delinquent debts which were discharged. He admitted responsibility for 12 \nunpaid delinquent debts which he acquired after his bankruptcy discharge (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nto 1.k and 1.n). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k was in his bankruptcy filing, and the IRS released \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.p were paid. He said he was \nmaking payments on his state tax lien of $15,387; however, he did not provide any proof \nof payments or other indications of his progress resolving this debt. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,10 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve \nhis delinquent debts.11 Applicant presented little evidence of good-faith efforts taken to \ncontact creditors, or to resolve his debts since he acquired them.  \n \n10  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n11  \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 \n20(b): \u201cThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances\u201d, and conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence established factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his \n1988 divorce, his failed business, raising four children, and his wife\u2019s and his medical \ncondition and the financial expenses associated with it. Notwithstanding, he failed to \npresent evidence to show how these past circumstances beyond his control impaired \nhis present ability to pay his debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Based on his security \nclearance applications, Applicant has been consistently employed since at least 2000. \nHe has continuously worked for his current employer since August 2006. He presented \nlittle evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented negotiations, payment \nplans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. He is responsible for 11 medical \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j) and a state tax lien of amount $15,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). It is \nunclear when his last payments were made on any of these 12 delinquent debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that he \nhas established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control of \nhis financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Although there is evidence that he has \nparticipated in some financial counseling (consulting with a bankruptcy attorney and a \ntax consultant), there are no indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. New delinquent debt surfaced after his 2002 bankruptcy. \nThere is insufficient information to establish that Applicant applied the knowledge \nobtained from financial counseling. I gave him credit for acting in good faith in his 2002 \nbankruptcy; however, there is insufficient evidence to show good faith12 in the resolution \n \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n12  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nof his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j and 1.m \nbecause Applicant did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d with respect to these \ndebts.  \n \nApplicant did not provide proof of any recent efforts to resolve his debts with the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j and 1.m. Considering the record as a whole, I conclude \nthese 11 debts, totaling about $25,000 are still valid, delinquent debts, and that \nApplicant is responsible for them. Applicant failed to provide copies of payment plans, \neven though he has available income, according to his 2006 budget, to take this \nreasonable and prudent action. He has elected not to pay or resolve his 11 delinquent \ndebts. His overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His financial problems are continuing and likely to \nrecur. He should have been more diligent and made greater efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2008. He has not \ncarried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the \nrecord evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. Aside from his delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal \n \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nissue), he is a law-abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. The overall amount of her delinquent debt at about \n$25,000 is relatively low.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of delinquent debt as shown by his 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, \nwhich listed over $125,000 in debt. He also had a federal tax lien of $91,134 as recently \nas 2002. Applicant was well aware of his financial responsibilities, and had sufficient \nresources to develop a payment plan and begin payment of the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nto 1.j and 1.m. He learned, or should have learned, of the security significance of these \ndelinquent debts in 2006 when he submitted his security clearance applications, and as \na result of his interview with a government investigator. His efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts were insufficient when compared to available income that he could \nhave used to address his delinquent debts. His actions were not adequate to fully \nresolve security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nand all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k to 1.l:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n to 1.s: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Mardula, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 12, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are based upon substantial record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\nGuideline J mitigating conditions is unsupported by record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s decision\nunder Guideline E is arbitrary and capricious; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is\nunsupported by record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 36 years old, divorced\nwith no children.  He works for a government contractor and has held a security clearance since\n1996.  \nIn July 2002, Applicant was driving on an interstate highway.  Another driver moved toward\nApplicant\u2019s vehicle suddenly, forcing Applicant onto the shoulder of the road.  As traffic was heavy,\nand had come to a stop, Applicant got out of his car and approached the driver of the other vehicle,\nwith whom he engaged in a \u201cverbal exchange.\u201d  \u201cWhen Applicant was leaving he put his palm on\nthe driver\u2019s window and leaned on it.  This caused the window to shatter.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Applicant\nwas ticketed for aggressive driving and destruction of property.  However, all charges were dropped\nwhen the driver of the other vehicle failed to appear in court.  \nIn 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with disobeying a police officer, fleeing or\nattempting to elude a law enforcement officer with sirens/lights activated, and reckless driving.  He\nwas found guilty of reckless driving, a second degree felony.  The incident occurred during\nApplicant\u2019s visit with a friend.  \u201cThey decided to go out motorcycle riding.  Applicant insists that\nhe saw a police car go ahead of him and stop his friend for speeding.  Applicant saw the police\nofficer and took the next exit.  He insists that the police were not trying to stop him, nor did the\npolice car have lights or siren alerting him to stop.  Applicant exited the highway and stopped several\ntimes.  He eventually followed the signs to the airport.  When he reached the airport, police cars\nsurrounded him.  He reports that he was in shock and had no idea that he was being followed . . .\nApplicant testified that he was advised to plead guilty to the felony charge and not risk a trial and\nthe possibility of jail time.\u201d  Id. and 2-3.\n\n3\nApplicant has had no other driving incidents on his record.  He no longer rides a motorcycle\nand uses cruise control on his vehicle.  He has received a Certificate of Restoration of Civil Rights\nfor his felony conviction.  \nIn 2006, when filling out his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant listed the 2005\nincident under the question inquiring about felony convictions.  However, as to the question about\nother arrests, charges or convictions, he answered \u201cno,\u201d failing to list the 2002 incident.  \u201cHe\ntestified credibly that it was an honest oversight.  He forgot about the 2002 incident, and because he\nwas the one who called the police and reported it and the charges were dismissed, it did not register\nas an arrest.  He felt as if it never happened.\u201d  Id. at 3.   \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel challenges the sufficiency of certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  The\nBoard will address these challenges below in its discussion of whether the Judge\u2019s decision was\nunsupported by the record evidence.\n    \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\n\n4\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised security concerns under\nGuidelines J and E.  However, Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions was not reasonably supported by the record.  The Board notes\nrecord evidence unaddressed in the Judge\u2019s decision which significantly undercuts her favorable\nconclusion as to mitigation.  For example, the Judge\u2019s decision under Guideline J is predicated, in\npart, on her finding that Applicant\u2019s breaking of the van window during the 2002 incident was\naccidental, that he merely placed his palm on the window and leaned on it.  However, there is record\nevidence, based on Applicant\u2019s own statements, that places the incident in a different light.  For\nexample, Government Exhibit (GE) 7 contains, inter alia, the summary of Applicant\u2019s personal\nsubject interview.  This document relates Applicant\u2019s description of the incident to a security\nclearance investigator:  \u201c. . . Subject and the driver of the van had a verbal exchange, as the subject\nwas walking away from the van he hit the driver\u2019s window with the butt of his hand and the window\nbroke.\u201d  GE 7 at 6 (emphasis added).  Similarly, Applicant testified at the hearing that \u201cout of\nfrustration as I was walking away, I banged on his window and . . . I was surprised that it just\nshattered . . .\u201d  Tr. at 78 (emphasis added).  The Judge\u2019s decision does not discuss this apparent\ncontrary evidence, with the result that she adopts without explanation a view of the incident that a\nreasonable person could find implausible, that Applicant having merely leaned on the van window\ncaused the glass to shatter.  \nSimilarly, the Judge adopts without discussion or explanation Applicant\u2019s description of the\n2005 incident.  That description presents him as exiting the highway unaware that the police were\nfollowing him and that, after stopping a few times, he found himself arrested at an airport.\nApplicant\u2019s account is not consistent with the police report of that event, contained in GE 4.  That\nexhibit states that the reporting officer observed Applicant \u201cmake [an] illegal u-turn.\u201d  The officer\nfurther states that he began pursuing Applicant with his emergency lights on.  \u201cThe driver saw me\nmake my turn and accelerated rapidly, fleeing.  I accelerated and made an attempt to catch up to the\ndriver.\u201d  The officer states that, with his lights and siren on, he got to within 10 to 15 feet of\nApplicant\u2019s motorcycle, at which point Applicant saw him and accelerated \u201cat a very high rate of\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.32(a), (d).   \n1\nSee Department Counsel Brief at 20: The Judge \u201ccharacterized the July 2002 arrest as forgettable in March\n2\n2006 as being in the \u2018distant past,\u2019 when the 2002 arrest was the first time he had ever been arrested, charged with two\nmisdemeanors under circumstances that he thought [were] inexplicable, was arraigned for the first time before a\nmagistrate, had to hire a lawyer, and then was spared a trial only because the complaining witness failed to appear to\ntestify.  These events are not credibly forgettable after less than four years . . .\u201d\n5\nspeed, reaching approx[imately] 140 MPH according [to] the [police surveillance] aircraft.\u201d  This\nofficer describes Applicant\u2019s further efforts to elude the police, at one point driving his motorcycle\nbetween two automobiles that were stopped at a red light.  He states that he lost contact with\nApplicant, but that other police and the aircraft kept him under observation, driving through\nexchanges at a major airport, where he was eventually arrested.  GE 4 at 1 - 2.  This account is\ndetailed and internally consistent.  It bears the name, badge number, and initials of the reporting\nofficer and the name, signature, and badge number of the officer\u2019s supervisor.  It is also consistent\nwith Applicant\u2019s own evidence that his attorney subsequently advised him to plead guilty to a felony\nin an effort to avoid going to jail.  As with the 2002 incident, the Judge\u2019s decision does not explain\nwhy she accepts Applicant\u2019s presentation of the event and why she concludes that the police report\nis less credible.  The Judge does not explain why she discounts evidence which, on its face, would\nsuggest that Applicant\u2019s presentation at the hearing was self-serving.  This, in turn, undercuts her\nconclusion that he has demonstrated trustworthiness or rehabilitation.  \n1\nRegarding the Guideline E allegations, the Judge accepted Applicant\u2019s explanation of having\nforgotten about the 2002 incident in completing his SCA.  The Judge does not explain why she finds\nthis credible, in light of the relative recency of the event and its unusual circumstances, which a\nreasonable person could believe would not easily be forgotten.   Neither does the Judge address\n2\napparent inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s explanations for his false answer, on one occasion calling\nit an honest oversight (Tr. at 106) and on another that he misread the question on the SCA  (Tr. at\n152).  While the Board gives deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations, that deference is not\nwithout limits.  Where, as here, the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility\n(inconsistent statements, contrary record evidence, etc.) the Judge should address that aspect of the\nrecord explicitly, explaining why he or she finds an applicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of\nbelief.  Failure to do so suggests that a Judge has merely substituted a favorable impression of an\napplicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-23504 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec.\n12, 2007) (in holding for Applicant, the Judge relied too heavily on his interpretation of Applicant\u2019s\ndemeanor and did not evaluate Applicant\u2019s credibility in light of the record as a whole).  See also\nFieldcrest Cannon, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 97 F.3d. 65 at 69 - 70 (4  Cir. 1996), to the effect that a Judge\u2019s\nth\ncredibility determinations can be rejected if they are unreasonable, contradict other findings of fact,\nare based on an inadequate reason, or on no reason at all.  Furthermore, the Judge found for\nApplicant on one of the Guideline E allegations without any discussion at all\u2013the decision mentions\nthe allegation nowhere except in the formal findings.  While this particular allegation incorporated\nthe Guideline J concerns, the Judge  should have evaluated it in light of the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions contained under Guideline E.     \n\n6\nAfter considering the briefs of the parties, the Judge\u2019s decision, and the record as a whole,\nthe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are not supported by \u201csuch\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See also Consolo, 383\nU.S. at 620.  Moreover, Department Counsel has met his burden of establishing that the Judge failed\nto consider an important aspect of the case, failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for material\nconclusions, and offered an explanation for her decision that ran contrary to the record evidence.\nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s overall favorable decision under Guidelines J and E is not sustainable\nunder the Egan standard.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\n   \nSigned: Michael D.

Facts The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 36 years old, divorced with no children. He works for a government contractor and has held a security clearance since 1996. In July 2002, Applicant was driving on an interstate highway. Another driver moved toward Applicant\u2019s vehicle suddenly, forcing Applicant onto the shoulder of the road. As traffic was heavy, and had come to a stop, Applicant got out of his car and approached the driver of the other vehicle, with whom he engaged in a \u201cverbal exchange.\u201d \u201cWhen Applicant was leaving he put his palm on the driver\u2019s window and leaned on it. This caused the window to shatter.\u201d Decision at 2. Applicant was ticketed for aggressive driving and destruction of property. However, all charges were dropped when the driver of the other vehicle failed to appear in court. In 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with disobeying a police officer, fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer with sirens/lights activated, and reckless driving. He was found guilty of reckless driving, a second degree felony. The incident occurred during Applicant\u2019s visit with a friend. \u201cThey decided to go out motorcycle riding. Applicant insists that he saw a police car go ahead of him and stop his friend for speeding. Applicant saw the police officer and took the next exit. He insists that the police were not trying to stop him, nor did the police car have lights or siren alerting him to stop. Applicant exited the highway and stopped several times. He eventually followed the signs to the airport. When he reached the airport, police cars surrounded him. He reports that he was in shock and had no idea that he was being followed . . . Applicant testified that he was advised to plead guilty to the felony charge and not risk a trial and the possibility of jail time.\u201d Id. and 2-3. 3 Applicant has had no other driving incidents on his record. He no longer rides a motorcycle and uses cruise control on his vehicle. He has received a Certificate of Restoration of Civil Rights for his felony conviction.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: John F. Mardula, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 15,\n2006. On January 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 12, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on February 14, 2008, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on March 17, 2008. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until April 24, 2008, in order for his counsel to be\navailable. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 31, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on April 24, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1\nMay 12, 2008\n\nApplicant believed he had an interim clearance in 1991-1992 (Tr. 115).\n1\n2\nthrough 12, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Exhibits A through E, without objection. Applicant also offered the\ntestimony of three witnesses. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May\n5, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 12, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b of the SOR, with explanations. He\ndenied that his omission was deliberate. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 36-years-old. He is divorced with no children. After his high school\ngraduation in 1991, he attended college. He graduated in 1998 with a bachelor of\nscience degree. While in college part time, Applicant worked full time for a government\ncontractor. He has maintained his current employment since 2005. He has held a\nsecurity clearance since 1996 (GE 1).1\nIn July 2002, Applicant was charged with aggressive driving and destruction of\nproperty. Applicant explained that he was driving on the interstate and the driver to his\nleft moved very close to Applicant\u2019s vehicle forcing Applicant to move to the right and off\nthe road onto the shoulder. The traffic was heavy on the highway. At one point Applicant\nwas behind the driver of the other vehicle. Applicant got out of his vehicle and\napproached the driver to speak to him. The driver lowered his window and there was a\nverbal exchange including a derogatory remark to Applicant. When Applicant was\nleaving he put his palm on the driver\u2019s window and leaned on it. This caused the window\nto shatter. When this occurred, Applicant called the police. The police arrived at the\nscene. Applicant was not arrested or charged with any violation. However, a few days\nlater, the police contacted Applicant. The police officer gave Applicant a ticket for\naggressive driving and destruction of property. The other party failed to appear in court\nand the charges against Applicant were dropped. Applicant offered to pay for the\nwindow and insisted that he did not intentionally break the window (GE 7).\nOn November 25, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with disobeying a\npolice officer, fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer with sirens/lights\nactivated, a felony, and reckless driving. He was found guilty of the second charge\n(second degree felony) and sentenced to 18 months supervised probation, fined,\nordered to complete 100 hours of community service, ordered to pay approximately\n$473 in court costs, and his license was suspended for one year (GE 4 and 8).\nApplicant was visiting a friend for the weekend. They decided to go out\nmotorcycle riding. Applicant insists that he saw a police car go ahead of him and stop\nhis friend for speeding. Applicant saw the police officer and took the next exit. He insists\n\n3\nthat the police were not trying to stop him, nor did the police car have lights or siren\nalerting him to stop. Applicant exited the highway and stopped several times. He\neventually followed the signs to the airport. When he reached the airport, police cars\nsurrounded him. He reports that he was in shock and had no idea that he was being\nfollowed. He also was not sure how fast he was going (Tr. 94) Applicant testified that he\nwas advised to plead guilty to the felony charge and not risk a trial and the possibility of\njail time (Tr. 99).\nApplicant reported this incident to his employer as soon as he returned to work\n(Tr. 97). An adverse report was issued on August 22, 2006. Thus, his employer was\nfully aware of Applicant\u2019s arrest and his conviction of a felony (GE 2).\nApplicant has been driving for almost 20 years. He has no other driving incidents\non his motor vehicle record. In fact, as of April 23, 2008, he has five plus point on his\nrecord which indicates no other incidents and that he has completed a driver\nimprovement class. (AE D). He no longer drives a motorcycle. He uses cruise control on\nhis vehicle (Tr. 104). He also has a Certificate of Restoration of Civil Rights for his\nfelony conviction (AE E).\nOn Applicant\u2019s March 15, 2006, security clearance application he responded to\nSection 23: Your Police Record. He checked \u201cyes\u201d to a. (have you ever been charged\nwith or convicted of any felony offense?) He disclosed his 2005 conviction and listed it\nas a felony. He also wrote a detailed note in the comments section.\nApplicant checked \u201cno\u201d to 23 f. (in the last 7 years, have you ever been arrested\nfor, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e,\nabove? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or\ndrug related.) Applicant did not list the 2002 charge for the aggressive driving that was\nultimately dismissed. He testified credibly that it was an honest oversight. He forgot\nabout the 2002 incident, and because he was the one who called the police and\nreported it and the charges were dismissed, it did not register as an arrest. He felt as if it\nnever happened (Tr. 151).\nApplicant volunteers for a youth program. The youth services coordinator with\nwhom he works is a police officer. The police officer testified at the hearing for\nApplicant. He has known him for three years (AE C). Applicant helps in the explorers\nprogram teaching teenagers to be responsible when having fun. Applicant is\nknowledgeable about motorcycles and used that as motivation to help kids learn\nlessons through role plays and various scenarios. The police officer found Applicant to\nbe consistent, articulate and a nice person. He also wants Applicant to help coach\nsoccer. The police officer believed the traffic incidents were out of character for\nApplicant (Tr. 48).     \nApplicant\u2019s colleagues testified at the hearing that he is a detail oriented,\nresponsible individual who follows rules and regulations (Tr. 36). He is described as\n\n4\ncalm and trustworthy (Tr. 38). Applicant is very professional, amiable, and possesses\ngood judgment (Tr. 62).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor recommends him. She has known him since 2005. He is a\nskilled professional with the ability to provide good and efficient customer support. He is\na good team member and coordinates very well with management and the rest of the\nteam. He always displays a professional attitude and takes direction from his\nmanagement without any problem (AE A). He has recommendations from his\ncolleagues, his supervisor, and a friend who is an attorney (AE B). Applicant is very\nprofessional in his conduct and work ethic. He is an asset to his current team. He gets\nalong well with others and has a strong commitment to his job. Applicant is a\nconscientious and meticulous worker. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n5\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s 2002 charge and arrest for Aggressive driving and Destruction of\nProperty and the 2005 conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude constitute criminal\nactivity as envisioned under \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement;\nApplicant has had no infractions with the law since 2005. He is described as an\nexemplary employee. He has held a clearance with no problems since 1996. He is a\n\n6\nvolunteer for a youth program. He regrets the incidents. He completed his probation and\nthe incidents seem out of character for Applicant. Thus, 32(a) and (d) apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant disclosed the information concerning the felony conviction (2005) on\nhis 2006 security clearance. He did not check \u201cyes\u201d for 23 f. I find him credible that he\ndid not think of that since it was in the distant past and the charges had been dropped.\nThe government did not establish that this was an intentional omission on the part of the\nApplicant. If he were trying to hide something, he would not have been so open with his\nemployer in 2005. Thus, \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n7\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant has been employed with the government for almost 16 years. During\ncollege he worked part time and full time when his class schedule allowed. He is\nrecommended for his clearance by his current supervisor. His colleagues describe him\nas a careful, calm and responsible person. He has volunteered with a police officer for\na number of years in a youth program. The police officer trusts Applicant and believes\nhe is a very responsible, trustworthy individual. Applicant regrets what he did in 2002.\nHowever, he called the police because he was upset at what had happened. The\ncharges were dismissed because the complainant did not appear. \nThe 2005 motorcycle incident culminated in a felony conviction for Applicant. He\nno longer drives a motorcycle. He has changed his driving habits. His driving record\nsupports that. He completed his probation. He has never had any difficulty at work with\nany situation. He immediately reported this incident to his employer after it happened.\nHe disclosed information on his 2006 security clearance application in detail concerning\nhis felony conviction. However, he did not check \u201cyes\u201d to 23 f. concerning any arrests in\nthe last 7 years. I find him credible in his explanation that he forgot about it in light of the\nfact that the charges were dropped and that as far as he was concerned it never\nhappened. Applicant did not intend to deceive the government. He did not falsify his\n2006 application.\nApplicant is a loyal and hardworking employee. He was candid at the hearing and\nwas credible in his testimony that he is not vulnerable to any threats or intimidation that\nmight jeopardize national security.\n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves\nme without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from criminal conduct and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 28-year old woman with one child, age three. She has been married twice. Her first marriage ended in divorce in 2003, and the second one ended in divorce in 2007. Applicant has a high school diploma and a certificate in computer technology from a technical college (Tr. 16). She is working toward an associates degree in computer technology. Since August 2006, Applicant has worked as a logistics engineer for a defense contractor. Her duties include inventory tracking and data entry (Tr. 16, 32). Between 1999 and 2008, Applicant accrued approximately $20,000 of delinquent debt. It consists of credit card accounts (SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h, and 1.q), the deficiency remaining from a voluntary automobile repossession (SOR subparagraph 1.j) and medical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.i, and 1.k through 1.p). Applicant blames immaturity and irresponsibility for her financial problems. She was a teenager when she opened most of the accounts. She does not attribute her financial problems to her divorces, stating that \u201cI feel as much responsible . . . [and] I never addressed it [the debt] during the divorce hearings\u201d (Tr. 34). The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a stemmed from relocation expenses accrued by her first husband, a member of the military, between 1999 and 2001. He was reimbursed for the expenses, but never applied the money to the credit card. She used the other credit cards listed in the SOR to purchase clothing and miscellaneous items",

Edmunds, Esquire\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its denial of Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance. Specifically, it alleged facts which raise concerns under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. This action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 3, 2008, and requested a hearing. I was\nassigned the case on April 29, 2008. On April 30, 2008, the hearing was scheduled for\nMay 20, 2008. At the hearing, I received five government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. Applicant submitted no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 5,\nJune 24, 2008\n\n2\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to a classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year old woman with one child, age three. She has been\nmarried twice. Her first marriage ended in divorce in 2003, and the second one ended in\ndivorce in 2007.\nApplicant has a high school diploma and a certificate in computer technology\nfrom a technical college (Tr. 16). She is working toward an associates degree in\ncomputer technology.\nSince August 2006, Applicant has worked as a logistics engineer for a defense\ncontractor. Her duties include inventory tracking and data entry (Tr. 16, 32).\nBetween 1999 and 2008, Applicant accrued approximately $20,000 of delinquent\ndebt. It consists of credit card accounts (SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h, and 1.q),\nthe deficiency remaining from a voluntary automobile repossession (SOR subparagraph\n1.j) and medical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.i, and 1.k through 1.p).\nApplicant blames immaturity and irresponsibility for her financial problems. She\nwas a teenager when she opened most of the accounts. She does not attribute her\nfinancial problems to her divorces, stating that \u201cI feel as much responsible . . . [and] I\nnever addressed it [the debt] during the divorce hearings\u201d (Tr. 34).\nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a stemmed from relocation expenses\naccrued by her first husband, a member of the military, between 1999 and 2001. He\nwas reimbursed for the expenses, but never applied the money to the credit card. She\nused the other credit cards listed in the SOR to purchase clothing and miscellaneous\nitems.\nIn 2002, Applicant consolidated her debt, through a credit repair company, and\nbegan making $130 monthly payments (Exhibit 3 at 7). She abandoned the payment\nplan approximately six months later, because \u201cnone of the balances were going down\u201d\n(Tr. 20). After the consolidation plan failed, she \u201cgave up and accepted that [she] was\ngoing to have bad credit for seven years\u201d (Tr. 12). \nApplicant purchased the automobile listed in SOR subparagraph 1.j in 2001. She\nfell behind on payments approximately two years later (Tr. 22). Realizing she was\nunable to afford further car payments, she returned it to the dealer. She never received\nany correspondence stating she owed a deficiency balance (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s medical bills primarily covered her maternity care (Exhibit 3 at 6).\nShortly after her daughter was born in 2004, she contested them asserting that they\n\n3\nwere her insurer\u2019s responsibility (Tr. 13). The insurance company rejected her claim\napproximately a year later (Tr. 37). \nApplicant did not list her repossession on her security clearance application as\nrequired. She did not consider it a repossession because she voluntarily returned it to\nthe dealer.\nApplicant also did not list her other delinquencies on the security clearance\napplication, as required. She mistakenly thought that charged off debts did not need to\nbe listed.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The government reposes a high degree of\ntrust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.\n\n4\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(b), \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations,\u201d and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may\nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Her\ndelinquencies remain unsatisfied. Although Applicant was divorced twice, she attributed\nher financial problems to her immaturity and irresponsibility, rather than to the divorces.\nShe attempted to satisfy the debts through a consolidation plan about five years ago,\nbut abandoned it after six months, and her dispute of the medical bills was rejected by\nthe insurance carrier.\nApplicant has no plans for satisfying the delinquencies. Rather, she will wait until\nthey are removed from her credit reports. This approach does not demonstrate the\nreform and rehabilitation necessary to mitigate the security concerns generated by her\nhistory of delinquent debt. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s security clearance application omissions raise the issue of\nwhether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. \n\n5\nApplicant has been candid about her inability to pay the debts and her intention\nto wait for them to be removed from her credit reports rather than satisfy them,\nthroughout the investigative process. Also, she did not deflect blame to her ex-\nhusbands, forthrightly blaming the problems on her immaturity and irresponsibility.\nUnder these circumstances, I conclude her responses were based on honest\nmisunderstandings of the questions. I conclude she did not falsify her security clearance\napplication, and that there are no personal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant was a teenager when she opened the majority of her credit card\naccounts, and was ill-prepared to use them responsibly. Nevertheless, approximately\nsix years have passed since she last attempted to satisfy them, and they remain\noutstanding. Upon considering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\ntogether with the whole person factors, I conclude Applicant remains a security risk.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines I and G for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 28, 2009. DOHA received his \nAnswer on February 2, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June \n30, 2009. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 1, 2009.

On August 23, 2009, the administrative judge previously assigned to the case \nnotified all parties by e-mail that the case was cancelled due to counsel unavailability. \nOn July 30, 2009, DOHA issued a notice canceling the hearing scheduled for August \n25, 2009. On September 1, 2009, the case was reassigned to me. On September 15, \n2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for October 27, 2009. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) Items 1 \nthrough 9, which were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 4, 2009.1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c.(2)., 1.d.(3), 1.d.(4), \n1.d.(6), and 2.a., and denied the remaining allegations. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old electronics technician, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since May 2006. He seeks a secret security clearance, which is a \ncondition of his continued employment. (GE 1, Tr. 45-47, 53.) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1987. He attended college from \nAugust 1988 to December 1988 and estimates that he earned \u201cnine or twelve\u201d credit \nhours. (Tr. 46.) Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from January 1990 to November \n1990, and was awarded an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance during \nhis brief period of naval service. (Tr. 51-52.) \n \n \nHe was married from December 1988 to May 1992. That marriage ended by \ndivorce. He remarried in November 1994. Two children were born during his first \nmarriage -- his daughter is 20 years old and his son is 18 years old. He has a six-year-\nold son from his current marriage. Applicant was granted full custody of his two children \nfrom his first marriage in 1998. Applicant\u2019s oldest daughter is married and living on her \nown and his two youngest children are living at home. Applicant\u2019s wife works full-time \nfor a local insurance agency. (Tr. 42-43, 48-50.) \n \nPsychological Conditions/Alcohol Consumption \n \nTo obtain a clearance, Applicant completed an e-QIP in July 2006. In doing so, \nhe reported, among other things that he had consulted with a mental health professional \nfor anxiety and depression. (GE 1.) This self-disclosure prompted an inquiry into \nApplicant\u2019s mental health history, which ultimately lead to an SOR being issued.  \n \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal representative had previously marked her exhibits with her own marking system. \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \nApplicant has been fighting depression for the better part of his adult life. The \nSOR alleges in \u00b6 1.a. that Applicant received mental health counseling from Dr. A \n(specialty unknown) as a teenager (dates unknown) for stress-related medical \nproblems. Applicant testified that he saw Dr. A \u201cat about 16 years of age or so\u201d for \n\u201creoccurring stomach issues.\u201d He saw Dr. A \u201cfor a few months\u201d and \u201cdid get better.\u201d (Tr. \n63-64.)  \n \nThe next time Applicant sought professional help for depression occurred in \napproximately 2003 when he consulted with Dr. B (internal medicine).2 Dr. B prescribed \nPaxil, the first in a series of anti-depressant drugs that Applicant\u2019s physicians would try \nas they tried to find the right medication for his condition.3 (AE Item 3A, AE Item 3D.) \n \nApplicant saw Dr. B for approximately two to three years from 2003 to 2006, but \nstopped seeing her because \u201cit was hard to get in to see [her].\u201d Medical records \ncompleted in November 2005 reflect Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant as (1) anxiety, (2) \npanic attacks, and (3) insomnia, secondary to above. (Response to SOR, AE Item 3A, \nTr. 66-67.) \n \nAfter seeing Dr. B, Applicant began seeing Dr. C (family practice) for his \ndepression in 2006 through the present. Medical records completed in January and \nAugust 2007 reflect Dr. C\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant as (1) depressive disorder and (2) \ndepression with anxiety. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Under the care of Dr. C, Applicant is currently \ntaking aspirin, Toprol (blood pressure), Zoloft (antidepressant), and Xanax (anxiety). He \nhas been taking these medications for at least the last 12 months and has no intention \nof discontinuing their use. (Response to SOR, GE 2, Tr. 67-68, 125.) \n \nSalient points in chronological order regarding Applicant from Dr. C\u2019s medical \nrecords reflect: (1) March 2006 \u201cdepressed mood for more than 6 months,\u201d (2) April \n2006 \u201cdepressed mood [m]uch better on meds,\u201d (3) December 2006 \u201cdepressed mood \nbetter on current rx,\u201d (4) July 2007 \u201cstill very depressed and panic d/o. not going to psyc \nany more.

Mental Status: active and alert, normal affect.\u201d (GE 2, AE Item 3.) \n \nAs noted supra, Dr. C made reference to Applicant no longer seeing a \npsychologist (Dr. D). Dr. C had referred Applicant to Dr. D. Applicant saw Dr. D for a \nbrief time from February 2007 to April 2007. During that time, Dr. D evaluated Applicant \nand in April 2007 medical records reflect his diagnosis as (1) major depression, \nmoderate to severe, chronic; (2) probable panic disorder without agoraphobia (anxiety \n \n2 Dr. B\u2019s involvement with Applicant is not reflected in the SOR. \n \n3 Record evidence reflects that Applicant was prescribed the following medications over the years for \ndepression and anxiety: (1) Paxil \u2013 prescribed in 2003; (2) Wellbutrin \u2013 prescribed in March 2006; (3) \nLexapro \u2013 prescribed in December 2006; (4) Alprazolam (generic for Xanax) \u2013 prescribed in April 2006; \n(5) Sertraline (generic for Zoloft) \u2013 prescribed in December 2008; and (6) Lamotrigine (generic for \nLamictal) \u2013prescribed in September 2008.

He also denied the alcohol abuse allegation. (Response to SOR.) \n \nSalient points in chronological order regarding Applicant from Dr. D\u2019s medical \nrecord reflect: (1) February 2007 \u201cInsight appears fairly good. Judgement functions are \nfair to hypothetical situations. On a gross clinical basis, intellectual functions appear \nwithin normal limits,\u201d and (2) February 2007 \u201cHe responds well to brief CBT [cognitive \nbehavioral therapy];\u201d \u201cI have also reviewed his MMPI [Minnesota Multiphasic Personality \nInventory] studies with him. These show a moderate level of depression one with \nanxiety and some [s]omatization [patients who chronically and persistently complain of \nvaried physical symptoms that have no identifiable physical origin].\u201d There is no \nevidence of psychosis or more malignant psychopathology [mental distress and \nabnormal, maladaptive behavior].\u201d (GE 3, AE Item 4.) \n \nThe Government retained the services of a Dr. E (psychiatrist) to conduct a \npsychiatric evaluation of Applicant for his pending security clearance. Dr. E completed \nhis evaluation in September 2009 and provided a provisional diagnosis of Applicant as \nfollows: (1) major depression, recurrent, moderate, without psychosis; (2) dysthymic \ndisorder history; (3) panic disorder without agoraphobia; (4) generalized anxiety \ndisorder; (5) alcohol abuse; and (6) nicotine dependence \u2013 full, sustained remission. \nThe doctor also noted he had concerns for Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d.) \n \nApplicant adamantly denied the accuracy of this diagnosis stating: \n \nSubparagraph d: (1) \u201cI deny\u201d \u2013 I deny having chronic to severe \nmajor depression. Response: I do admit of going through a phase of it and \nhaving a \u201cmidlife\u201d crisis. I did not know how to handle it on my own so I \nsought the advice of a medical doctor; he put me on medication to help \ncontrol the panic. At the time of this second interview my only issue was \nmood stabilization; this report did show recurrent moderate without \nPsychosis; I do not understand how one can suffer bouts of panic and \nanxiety and then be diagnosed as chronic severe major depression by one \ndoctor after a thirty minute session. It appears the second doctor used the \nfirst doctors records, then after careful consideration changed the \ndiagnosis to recurrent moderate, and then used his diagnosis as Alcohol \nDependent, after I told him I have not consumed any alcohol beverage \nsince April 2008. I feel that he made no attempt to gather adequate \nrecords from my medical doctor and paid no attention to what I told him. \n \n(2) \u201cI deny\u201d this diagnosis of \u201cDysthymic Disorder\u201d based on \ndefinition, \u201ca chronic condition by depressive symptoms that occur for \nmost of the day, more days than not, for at least 2 years. During this \n\n5 \n \n                                                          \nperiod, any symptom free interval cannot last longer than 2 months.\u201d \nI usually go for 6 to 8 months without attacks. \n \n(3) \u201cI admit\u201d to having a panic disorder. I have panic and anxiety \nattacks. Approximately 2.4 million American adults have panic disorder. \n(National Institutes of Mental Health). \n \n(4) \u201cI admit\u201d to having Generalized Anxiety Disorder. More than 19 \nmillion American adults have an anxiety disorder. (National Institutes of \nMental Health). \n \n(5) \u201cI deny\u201d being an alcoholic or alcohol abuse. I drank one to two \ntimes per week, most all on weekends only. In my younger days, ages 25 \n\u2013 30 I admit to drinking more heavily. At the time of this diagnosis, I had \nnot drunk anything in over 6 months. \n \n(6) \u201cI admit\u201d I smoked for almost 20 years and quit in August of \n2007. Not sure what importance that has on my clearance. (Response to \nSOR. Emphasis added by Applicant.) \n \nDr. E was called as a witness by the Government.4 Dr. E stated that he prepared \nhis evaluation after interviewing Applicant and reviewing the records of Drs. B, C and D \nas well as Applicant\u2019s e-QIP and a list of his medications. (Tr. 71.) \n \nAlthough Dr. E\u2019s evaluation appears to be thoughtful and well written, there are at \nleast two factual discrepancies that are incorrect and appear to have factored into his \ndiagnosis. First, his evaluation makes reference to Applicant\u2019s past consumption of \nalcohol as being rather heavy, i.e. \u201c[Applicant] reports drinking a 1/5th of Jim Beam once \nper week prior to this. In the past, he says that he was drinking up to 1/5th of Jim Beam \nevery other day.\u201d (GE 5, AE Item 6.) Applicant\u2019s testimony, the testimony of his wife, \nand past medical records dispute this. Applicant and his wife testified that he had not \nhad a drink since April 2008. Applicant\u2019s wife emphatically stated, \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] never \nhad a fifth of whiskey every other day, ever.\u201d Applicant reported that he told Dr. E that \nhe quit drinking during his interview. Additionally, the fact that Applicant had quit \ndrinking was reported in Dr. D\u2019s medical records and corroborates the testimony of \nApplicant and his wife. Dr. E apparently adopted or concurred with Dr. D\u2019s diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse, which was somewhat dated at the time Dr. E evaluated Applicant. Dr. E \nadded that the discrepancy in Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption would not make a \ndifference in his diagnosis given \u201cthe rest of the information in the record.\u201d (Response to \nSOR, GE 3, AE Item 4, Tr. 32-34, 56-58, 94-95.)  \n \nAdditionally, Dr. E reported in his recommendations that Applicant was not taking \nany medications for his symptoms. This fact is contradicted by Applicant\u2019s testimony \nand by Dr. C\u2019s medical records, which state Applicant is taking medications as \nprescribed by Dr. C. (GE 2, GE 5, AE Item 3, AE Item 6, Tr. 124-125, see also fn 3, \nsupra.)  \n \n4 Dr. E\u2019s testimony was offered by way of speaker phone in the hearing room. \n\n6 \n \nAt the conclusion of his testimony, Dr. E added: \n \nI usually don\u2019t add things, but what I would like to say is, at the end of this \ninterview, my concern was that he (Applicant) get treatment and he \nabstain from alcohol, and that I\u2019m not qualified to determine whether his \nchance of lapsing in judgment will impair a specific or cause problems for \na specific security risk, but I think that there is treatment and the anxiety \nand depression come under full control, that quite often people can do \nwell. And I just wanted to \u2013 that was what \u2013 my point at the end of this. But \nI was concerned, as we\u2019ve talked about, for those \u2013 for the preceding \nreasons. That\u2019s all I needed to say (emphasis added). (Tr. 106.) \n \nOn September 10, 2009, Drs. B and C stated in writing that Applicant\u2019s mental \nstatus does not impair his ability to protect any classified information which may be \ngiven to him by the Department of Defense. As previously noted, Applicant sought \ntreatment from Dr. B from 2004 to 2006 and Dr. C began treating Applicant in 2006 until \nthe present. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf. I found her testimony to be credible. She \nand Applicant have been together 17 years. She stated Applicant quit drinking on April \n4, 2008. Before he quit drinking, she estimated he drank a half a pint to a pint of \nwhiskey on the weekends. She is familiar with his drinking habits because she prepared \nhis drinks. Applicant\u2019s drink of choice was a mixed drink of whiskey and Dr. Pepper. She \nadded that she never experienced family problems as a result of Applicant\u2019s drinking. \nApplicant has never had an alcohol-related driving offense. She never felt in danger as \na result of his psychological conditions. She stated Applicant sought ministerial help \nfrom their local church to cope with depression and anxiety. He also has a network of \nfamily and friends to rely on for additional help. Applicant\u2019s wife emphasized that Dr. E\u2019s \nreport of Applicant consuming a fifth of whiskey every other day is completely \nerroneous. She further stated Applicant is involved with their children. He has had to \nhave his medications adjusted over the years and is currently under the care of Dr. C. \n(Tr. 18-44.) \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. I found his testimony to be credible. The \nlast drink Applicant had was in April 2008. He described his former drinking habits as \ndrinking a pint of whisky (mixed drinks) on the weekends. Applicant also described the \nvarious medications he was prescribed over the years to control his depression as well \nas his reactions to those medications. Applicant did not particularly find his experience \nwith Dr. D favorable, but does enjoy a good rapport with Dr. C, his current physician, \nand follows his advice. He described the ministerial counsel he received from his local \nchurch which included listening to a CD program \u201cAttacking Anxiety and Depression.\u201d \nHe is taking the medications prescribed by Dr. C and has no intention of discontinuing \ntheir use. Applicant addressed and disputed the discrepancies in his medical records \nregarding his past use or purported alcohol abuse, as well as Dr. E inaccurately \nreporting that he was not taking medications. (Tr. 45-68, 108-134.) \n \n \n\n7 \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant submitted six reference letters, which are summarized: \n \n1. Current supervisor and system analyst \u2013 He has known Applicant since 2006. He \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s work ethic and dedication as \u201cabove reproach.\u201d Contract changes \nresulted in cutting company positions from twelve to eight and \u201conly the best remained \nto maintain the highest efficiency rating.\u201d He concluded by saying that Applicant is an \nasset to the company and he would like to keep him as a member of his team. \n(Response to SOR, AE Item 7.) \n \n2. Co-worker and electronics technician \u2013 He has known Applicant since 2006. He \ndescribed Applicant as an employee who has \u201cmany times contributed greatly to the \nhigh caliber of mission readiness.\u201d Applicant is more than capable of handling any task \nthat is assigned to him in an efficient and professional manner. He concluded by saying \nthat Applicant is a well liked and well respected individual with an \u201cundying dedication to \nthe men and women of our armed services . . . of whom we train.\u201d (Response to SOR.) \n \n3. Friend and co-worker \u2013 He has been a friend of Applicant for 16 years and a co-\nworker since 2005. He described Applicant as a trusted and reliable person that he and \nhis family can depend on in time of need. Applicant no longer drinks or smokes, is very \nhard working, dependable, and reliable. Applicant is a family man and is involved with \nhis children. Applicant is \u201cvery level headed\u201d and \u201cnever let his medical problems . . . \ninterfere with his work.\u201d He concluded by saying that Applicant\u2019s \u201cdedication to his \nfamily, God, work and friends is inspirational\u201d and that he was honored to know him and \ncall him a friend. (AE Item 7.) \n \n4. Previous employer (owner and supervisor) \u2013 He was Applicant\u2019s previous employer \nfrom 2001 to 2005. Applicant was employed as the manager of his business, which \nconsists of providing coffee machines, and coffee, party supplies, and janitorial supplies \nto local businesses. He stated Applicant supervised two employees and had direct \ncontact with his customers. Applicant was responsible for daily deposits, keeping the \nbooks, paying the bills, and performing payroll functions. Applicant always presented \nhimself in a professional manner. Applicant is very dependable and a model employee. \nHe concluded by saying \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] knowledge, trustworthiness, dedication, \ndependability, work ethics, and professionalism was evident in his everyday activities \nand makes him the kind of employee you would be honored to have, and I would hire \nagain.\u201d (AE Item 7.) \n \n5. Previous co-worker and friend \u2013 He worked with Applicant when Applicant was \nemployed at his previous employer from 2001 to 2005. He stated Applicant went out of \nhis way to see that each customer was fully satisfied with company products and \nservices. Applicant was professional, treated people fairly, and gave his best effort to \nthe businesses he served. Applicant was dedicated to his family, job, and customers \nand did not let his anxiety or panic attacks affect his ability to do his job. Applicant is \n\u201cthe kind of person one is proud to associate with and work with\u201d and \u201cI would gladly \nwork with [Applicant] again.\u201d (AE Item 7.) \n\n8 \n \n6. Friend and co-member of Masons \u2013 He is a 25-year friend of Applicant. He has \nassociated with Applicant frequently during that time span and stated that Applicant has \nnever been an alcoholic. Applicant has not had a drink since April 2008. Applicant \n\u201cworks very hard at controlling the depression that comes with the panic attacks, and is \ndetermined that this will not control his life. His faith in God has been his sustaining \nstrength, and he is under the care of a good physician. He is taking medication \nprescribed by his doctor.\u201d Applicant is very involved with his family in all respects \nwhether it is attending a sporting event or taking his children to the doctor. Applicant is \nthe Master of their local Mason\u2019s Lodge and presides over approximately 65 men. He is \nso well regarded at the Lodge that he was asked to serve an additional term as Master. \nHe concluded, \u201cthe world is a better place in which to live because of [Applicant\u2019s] \ndedication to God, family, work, and friends. I am proud to say that [Applicant] is my \nfriend and co-mason.\u201d (AE Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a certified copy of his police record that reflects he does not \nhave any adverse information on his driving record or have a criminal record. (AE Item \n7.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n9 \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude two relevant security concerns under Guidelines I and G are \napplicable.  \n \nPsychological Conditions \n \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern relating to psychological conditions: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of seeking mental health counseling. \n \nAG \u00b6 28 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but \nnot limited to emotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, \nparanoid, or bizarre behavior; \n \n\n10 \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may \nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and  \n \n(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a \ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take \nprescribed medication. \n \nThe Government produced sufficient evidence warranting application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n28(a), (b), and (c). Applicant was diagnosed by Dr. E (Government psychiatrist) with \nmajor depression, recurrent, moderate, without psychosis; dysthymic disorder history; \npanic disorder without agoraphobia; and generalized anxiety disorder. Dr. E also noted \nthat Applicant was not taking any medications for his symptoms. These factors raise \nconcerns under this Guideline and warrant further inquiry. \n \nFive psychological conditions mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 29 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one \ncaused by death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been \nresolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional \ninstability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) fully apply to Appellant\u2019s case. His condition is \nreadily controllable with treatment. He has been under the care of Dr. C since 2006 and \nis taking his prescribed medications. Before that, he was under the care of Dr. B from \n2004 to 2006. Although Dr. E\u2019s (Government psychiatrist) report is not particularly \nfavorable, he did state in his testimony that patients with depression can do quite well \nwith treatment. Dr. C (Applicant\u2019s current physician) clearly supports the notion that \nApplicant is doing well. Applicant has also sought and received ministerial support from \nhis church as well as family support. His wife\u2019s testimony and his references provide \n\n11 \n \npersuasive evidence covering 25 years of his personal and professional life. All of these \nindividuals report that Applicant\u2019s condition is under control and is properly monitored \nand managed. Drs. B and C are most familiar with Applicant, unlike Dr. D, who saw him \nfor about three months in 2007 and Dr. E who saw him for a relatively brief one-time \nevaluation. I find the opinions rendered by Dr. B and C more persuasive given their \nextensive history with Applicant. Since at least 2003, Applicant has voluntarily sought \nprofessional help and followed his attending physician\u2019s (Dr. C\u2019s) treatment plan, which \nincludes taking his medications. According to Drs. B and C, Applicant\u2019s condition is \namenable to treatment. Dr. C\u2019s most recent medical notes state that Applicant\u2019s insight \nreflects good judgment and his mental status is active and alert with normal affect. In \nsum, his prognosis is good.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s superb employment record, family life and community involvement \npaint a picture of stability. Applicant has learned how to cope with his depression as \nnoted by the evidence he presented. Dr. C noted Applicant\u2019s good judgment and that \nApplicant was not suffering from major depression. In September 2009, Drs. B and C, \ndoctors most familiar with Applicant, stated that his mental status does not impair his \nability to protect classified information. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence \nas a whole, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the concerns raised under psychological \nconditions.  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the security concern relating to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nAG \u00b6 22 provides two potentially disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence. \n \nThe primary focus of this case centers on Applicant\u2019s psychological conditions. \nAlcohol consumption concerns collaterally arose apparently after a psychologist \nreviewed Applicant\u2019s medical records. Alcohol consumption concerns were identified as \na result of information contained in Drs. D and E\u2019s evaluations. Dr. D, who Applicant \nsaw for three months, and Dr. E, who Applicant saw for a one-time evaluation, both \ndiagnosed Applicant as an alcohol abuser based on heavy alcohol consumption. These \ndiagnoses sufficiently raised disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c) and (d). \n\n12 \n \nFour alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 29 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nAssuming arguendo that the diagnosis of alcohol abuse is based on accurate \ninformation, AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) fully apply. Applicant\u2019s descriptions of his alcohol \nconsumption have been consistent. He acknowledged his alcohol consumption in the \npast. Applicant has not had a drink since April 2008 and has established a sufficient \nperiod of abstinence. He leads a life of total sobriety. As noted, Applicant adamantly \ndisputes the accuracy of his purported past alcohol consumption, particularly as \nreported by Dr. E, and has successfully rebutted those inaccuracies. Applicant\u2019s work \nbehavior has not been indicative of his having an alcohol problem. He is considered a \nvaluable employee, who is reliable, dependable, and professional. In any event, \nApplicant is under the care of Dr. C, who is monitoring his overall condition. AG \u00b6\u00b6 (c) \nand (d) are not relevant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n13 \n \n                                                          \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and a well-\ngrounded member of his community and a dedicated family man. He honorably served \nin the Navy, albeit for a short period of time. He has worked for his employer since May \n2006. He has the full support of company management as well as the support of his \nformer employer. Except for the pending allegations, there is no evidence of \nquestionable behavior by Applicant.  \n \nApplicant has been willing to do whatever is necessary to manage his depression \nand he ended his alcohol consumption in April 2008, two years ago. His struggle has \nnot always been easy, yet he continues to persevere. Drs. D and E\u2019s evaluations of \nApplicant are not favorable; however, when comparing the basis of their diagnoses with \nthat of Drs. B and C, who have treated Applicant for years, I am inclined to give greater \nweight to the latter. I also gave considerable weight to Applicant\u2019s testimony, the \ntestimony of his spouse, and his reference letters. These letters covered the range of \nprofessional, personal, and community involvement. When balancing the evidence pro \nand con, I find the scale weighs in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant has significant family and church support, stable \nemployment and a strong work ethic. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and \ncommitment to his condition. Considering his demeanor and testimony, I believe \nApplicant recognizes the importance of maintaining his treatment plan and managing \nhis depression. In sum, I find Applicant has sufficiently mitigated security concerns \nraised.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his psychological conditions and alcohol consumption \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

She answered the SOR in writing on March 28, \n2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.

She has never been married and has two \nsons, ages 11 and 5. GE 1, Tr. 12-13.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded among other things the review of her March 2006 e-QIP, her September 2007 \nSigned Response to Interrogatories and Attachments, her May 1998 Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy Report, and her April 2008, December 2007 and March 2006 Credit Bureau \nReports. GE 1 \u2013 6. \n \nThe background investigation revealed that Applicant had filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in November 1997, and was awarded a discharge in May 1998. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a.) Response to SOR, GE 3. Applicant stated she was held responsible for significant \ndebts accrued from a failed relationship. Tr. 21-24. \n \nSince she was awarded her discharge in May 1998, she has accumulated 20 \ndebts totaling approximately $58,040. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \u2013 1.v.) Two of these debts are \nfederal tax liens totaling $23,571. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \u2013 1.d.) She incurred this federal tax \nliability from non-payment of federal income taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nfor tax years December 1998 through December 2001, December 2003, and December \n2006. AE E, Tr. 28-29. Applicant stated she increased her exemptions to allow her to \nhave a larger net income, which she needed to pay her living expenses and also \ncashed in her 401k retirement account incurring penalties. Tr. 28-29. Applicant stated \nshe has adjusted her exemptions to the \u201cright amount.\u201d Tr. 30. Applicant established a \n\n \n3 \n \n \npayment plan with the IRS in 2002. Currently, she is making monthly payments of $200 \nto the IRS and is up-to-date. AE E \u2013 AE I, Tr. 27-33. \n \nIn addition to federal tax liens, discussed supra, the SOR alleges she has two \nstate tax liens totaling $4,808. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. \u2013 1.f.) Applicant incurred her state tax \nliability the same way as her federal tax liability, i.e. taking too many exemptions to have \na larger net income, and cashed in her 401k retirement account early. She has since \nadjusted her exemptions to the correct number. She has not paid her state tax liens, but \nintends to do so when able. Tr. 33-35. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a $75 past due car loan payment, which has been paid. In fact, \nApplicant paid off the entire car loan in May 2008. AE J, AE K, Tr. 35-36. SOR \u00b6 1.q. is \na $1,859 debt owed to her state for an overpayment of unemployment benefits. She has \ncontacted her state agency and negotiated an agreement make $50 monthly payments, \nbut has been unable to make any payments. Tr. 46-47. \n \nThe remaining SOR allegations consist of 14 debts totaling approximately \n$23,727. These debts include a combination of collection accounts, charged off \naccounts, and a past due account. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. \u2013 1.p., 1.r. \u2013 1.v.) Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies began in 2001 and continues through today. GE 4 \u2013 GE 6. Applicant\u2019s \nplan to resolve these debts is to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which has yet to be filed. \nShe entered into a Bankruptcy Engagement Agreement with a law firm on September \n11, 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) At the time of hearing, Applicant had paid $850 towards a \n$1,700 retainer fee. The law firm requires full fee payment before they will file \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition. GE AE A \u2013 AE D, Tr. 24-26.  \n \nApart from her debt to the IRS and late car payment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. \u2013 1.d., 1.g.), all \nremaining debts alleged remain unpaid or unresolved. Applicant\u2019s net monthly take \nhome pay is approximately $2,790. Tr. 52-53. Her boyfriend and father of her children \nlives with her and pays $260 monthly rent. He also owns a car, which the household \nuses for transportation. Tr. 54, 65. \n \nApplicant has sought financial counseling on two occasions. The first was a one-\ntime session offered through a previous employer in the 2000 \u2013 2001 timeframe. The \nsecond was a series of seminars offered by her present employer. Applicant also must \ncomplete financial counseling in conjunction with her planned Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, \nwhich has yet to occur. Tr. 54-55. Applicant\u2019s 11-year-old son suffers from asthma and \nallergies. Her five-year-old son is in good health. Tr. 64-65. Applicant describes her \ncurrent situation as \u201cliving from paycheck to paycheck.\u201d Tr. 68. \n \nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to three separate periods of \nunemployment, i.e. January 2000 through March 2000, November 2001 through March \n2002, and December 2005 through January 2006 or underemployment while employed. \nGE 1, Tr. 36-38.  \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any employee performance evaluations, reference \nletters or character evidence. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligations dating back to \n1997, when she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Since being awarded a discharge in \n1998, she has accumulated 20 delinquent debts totaling approximately $58,040.  \n \nApplicant is making monthly payments to the IRS and has satisfied one small \ndebt of $75 for a late car payment. Accordingly, she has addressed three of the 20 \ndebts alleged in the SOR. The remaining 17 debts remain unpaid or unresolved. \nApplicant hopes to include the majority of her debt in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy yet to be \nfiled. For these 17 debts, her financial recovery plan is prospective in nature. Her \nfinancial difficulties remain ongoing. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition \n(FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history \nof not meeting financial obligations; apply in this case.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude that Applicant is able to \nreceive partial credit under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC \u00b6 \n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; for her three periods of unemployment. I also gave Applicant \npartial credit for receiving credit counseling under FC 20(c) the person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. \n \nHowever, whatever credit she received by those MCs is overcome by years of \nfinancial mismanagement going back at least 11 years. Applicant presented minimal or \nno evidence documenting efforts taken to contact or resolve debts with her unpaid \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n2  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncreditors. Nor does the evidence support the notion that her past participation in \nfinancial counseling netted any tangible results.  \n \nAccordingly, I specifically considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b): and FC MC \u00b6 20(c), and \nconcluded they do not apply given the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated \ntestimony fails to establish mitigating factors that may be considered as circumstances \nbeyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her debts.  \n \nShe presented no evidence to show she has dealt responsibly with her financial \nobligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, credible payment plans). Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack \nof favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility, or that she has taken control of her financial situation. Based on \nher past performance, her prospective assurances ring hollow. Her financial problems \nare likely to be a concern in the future. Moreover, her financial problems are recent, not \nisolated, and ongoing.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial difficulties.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.b.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c. \u2013 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e. \u2013 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h. \u2013 1.v.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DOHA received that request on\nFebruary 26, 2008, and the matter was assigned to me on February 27, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant proposed a March 25, 2008, hearing, and a Notice\nof Hearing was issued on March 14, 2008, to set the hearing for that date.\nApril 15, 2008\n\n Tr. 8.\n1\n Tr. 15-16.\n2\n Tr. 35.\n3\n Tr. 15.\n4\n Id.\n5\n Tr. 59.\n6\n2\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted three\nexhibits (Ex.). which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-3 without objection.\nApplicant submitted one exhibit, accepted as Ex. A without objection. No witnesses\nwere called. Department Counsel referenced a typographical error in the SOR, noting\nthat the second line of allegation 1.a stating \u201cuntil at least May 2007\" should have read\n\u201cuntil at least May 2006.\u201d Applicant concurred with the correction and reaffirmed his\nadmission to the allegation.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 2, 2008. Based\n1\nupon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old government consultant who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since 2001. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting information\nsystems and currently works as a computer operating system subject matter expert. He\nhas been married for 23 years and has three children, currently aged 19, 21, and 23.\nThroughout most of Applicant\u2019s married life, he and his wife strived to provide a\nnurturing home for their children in which church attendance and open discussion were\nencouraged.  Applicant prided himself in being the head of the family. In 2005, their\n2\nyoungest child was 16 years of age. She was strong willed and highly social, as\nopposed to her more reserved siblings.  It was often difficult for Applicant to help her\n3\naddress her problems.  Moreover, she could not drive a car and felt bored and isolated\n4\nat home. Applicant had already tackled the issue of cigarette smoking with he was\n\u201cwere alarmed and upset\u201d to discover she was buying and using marijuana.  \n5\nAround the same time in 2005, Applicant and his wife were having their own\nrespective problems. For the first time in their lengthy marriage, each felt overwhelmed\nby a number of factors, including marital, professional, and personal problems.  He was\n6\nexperiencing anxiety and some panic disorders while his wife was suffering from\nfibromyalgia and mild depression. Both were prescribed and taking Zoloft, an\nantidepressant. Applicant feels the medication affected his judgment and control and, in\nconcert with his stress, led Applicant and his wife to occasionally do things that they\nwould usually not otherwise do. He stated that, as of about July 2005, this included the\nuse of marijuana about once a week, a drug which he had not used since college.\nApplicant\u2019s problems and prescription also affected the way he dealt with his youngest\n\n Tr. 16.\n7\n Tr. 17.\n8\n Tr. 47.\n9\n Tr. 39.\n10\n Tr. 19-20, 30.\n11\n Tr. 20.\n12\n Tr. 21.\n13\n See., e.g., Tr. 55.\n14\n Tr. 22-23.\n15\n Tr. 25.\n16\n Tr. 26-27.\n17\n3\nchild\u2019s marijuana use.  Rather than forbid her use of the illegal drug or to forbid its use\n7\nin their home, he decided she could use marijuana at home, where he believed her\nillegal drug use would be \u201csafer.\u201d  Eventually, parents and daughter used marijuana\n8\ntogether. \nApplicant never bought illegal drugs directly. He and his wife had taken in a\nfamily friend after the friend was released from prison  to help in his rehabilitation.  The\n9\n10\nyoung man knew people who sold marijuana, so Applicant would buy the substance\nthrough him. Twice during the summer of 2005, however, Applicant gave his 16-year-\nold daughter money to go buy drugs for him from a known source in the\nneighborhood.  \n11\nApplicant\u2019s change in behavior in 2005 carried over to his work life. Although now\nin his 40s, he increased his after hours socialization with co-workers, often joining them\nfor cocktails after work. One night in April 2006, following a post-work happy hour, he\nwas charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and put on probation for a year.  As\n12\npart of his probation, Applicant was not permitted to drink alcohol or smoke \u201canything.\u201d13\nApplicant successfully completed a 10 week alcohol education course and 20\nweeks of group counseling, attended a alcohol-focused victim impact panel session,\nand refrained from drinking and smoking. His counseling was non-medical, mostly\nconducted by licensed clinical social workers and credentialed specialists.  During this\n14\ntime, his interaction with many of the individuals in counseling \u201cchanged the way that\n[he] looked at\u201d himself as he realized \u201cthat\u2019s not me.\u201d  The experience made him\n15\nreconsider his recent poor choices.  He has successfully re-assumed his role as head\n16\nof his household and provides guidance for his family.  He stopped using marijuana in\n17\nMay 2006 and his family is now drug-free. He does not associate with those who use\ndrugs or drink heavily. Applicant is refocused on his parental duties as a leader and role\n\n Tr. 23.\n18\n Tr. 30.\n19\n Tr. 38.\n20\n Tr. 23; 51-53.\n21\n See, e.g., Tr. 53.\n22\n Tr. 50.\n23\n4\nmodel, he quit smoking cigarettes, and strictly limited his use of alcohol.  He has no\n18\nintention of using drugs in the future or to let it \u201cbe a part of [his family\u2019s] lives.\u201d   \n19\n-\nAs Applicant was completing his final counseling sessions, he completed his e-\nQIP in October 2006. At the time, Applicant explained to his daughter the importance of\ntheir getting their lives together and how their actions could impact their future. He\nspecifically pointed to his execution of the e-QIP, noting that he was obligated to\nhonestly and fully admit in detail the facts surrounding his alcohol use and drug use.20\nUnder Section 23 (Your Police Record), he acknowledged he had been \u201ccharged with\nor convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs.\u201d He cited to his April 2006\nDWI, described in detail the action taken by the county court, and listed all his probation\nterms. Under Section 25 (Your Use of Alcohol), Applicant gave detailed information as\nto his alcohol-related treatment between June 2006 and November 2006.\nUnder Section 24 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity), Applicant\nadmitted that he had illegally used a controlled substance in the last seven years and\nnoted that he used marijuana about four times per month from July 2005 through May\n2006. Because he believed the question made reference to personal monetary profit,\nhowever, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been involved\nin the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping,\nreceiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for\nyour own intended profit or that of another.\u201d  His statements have been consistent on\n21\nthis interpretation throughout this process.  In his interview after submitting the\n22\napplication, Applicant volunteered that he had twice given his daughter money to buy\nmarijuana.\nApplicant successfully completed all court-required aspects of his probation. His\nprobationary period ended May 14, 2007. He has been screened for drug usage in the\npast year without adverse incident. His family took 20 weeks of family counseling to\nwork on their own dynamics and for Applicant to work on his marriage.  Today, the\n23\nfamily lives together harmoniously with Applicant actively serving as the family\u2019s leader.\nApplicant is embarrassed and contrite about his judgment lapses concerning drugs.   \n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n24\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n25\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n26\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n24\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n25\nclearance decision is on the applicant.  \n26\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n Id.\n27\n Id.\n28\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n29\n6\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n27\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n28\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n29\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement. The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse\nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions\nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include drugs,\nmaterials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants,\nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other substances. \u201cDrug\nabuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nApplicant, now 44 years of age, used marijuana in high school and in college. He\nalso admits he bought and weekly used marijuana about once a week between July\n\n Because Applicant readily admits he bought the marijuana he used, specific discussion as to the unique\n30\nfacts involved in how he solicited such purchases is reserved for Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\n7\n2005 and May 2006. Consequently, Drug Involvement (DI) Disqualifying Condition (DC)\nAG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) applies.  With a disqualifying condition thus established,\n30\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security concerns.\nIn context, Applicant\u2019s student abuse of marijuana can be characterized as a\nyouthful indiscretion with no apparent nexus to his marijuana use over 20 years later.\nThat 10 months of weekly marijuana abuse in 2005-2006 occurred during an isolated\nperiod fraught with personal problems and a diagnosed anxiety disorder that\nnecessitated a prescription drug. Although Applicant presents no medical corroboration\nas to that drug\u2019s effect on his thinking, the facts do indicate that at all other times he\nwas a husband and father who proudly served as a role model who maintained strict\ncontrol of both his family and himself. Applicant\u2019s credible testimony also shows that the\nApril 2006 DWI and subsequent counseling prompted him to regain control of his family\nand his life. Given the unique personal problems existent at the time, there is scant\nlikelihood that the situation will repeat itself. Therefore, DI Mitigating Condition (MC) AG\n\u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. None of the other DI MCs,\nhowever, apply.\nApplicant acknowledges that he made an adult choice to personally use illegal\ndrugs and he has made the adult choice to take personal responsibility for his actions.\nIn voluntarily disclosing facts that otherwise would never have been known, he\ndemonstrated honesty, candor, and genuine contrition. His explanations as to why he\nused marijuana, why he stopped using it, and what he has done to change his life in\nsuch a way as to eschew drugs in the future are highly credible. In light of his nominal\ndrug use during an isolated period, his embarrassment over his lapse in judgment with\nregard to his personal integrity and familial responsibilities, and his depiction of how he\nturned his life back around, Applicant has mitigated significant security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nApplicant faces two allegations regarding such conduct. First, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto e-QIP Section 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Activity regarding the fact he bought\nmarijuana for personal use. He explained that he interpreted the question\u2019s phrasing \u2013\n\u201chave you been involved in the illegal purchase . . . [of] cannabis for your own intended\nprofit or that of another\u201d \u2013 to ask whether he had purchased drugs to make money or\nreap monetary profit for himself or others. Consequently, he answered \u201cno.\u201d \n\n8\nIn all other respects, Applicant\u2019s e-QIP answers are candid and detailed. There is\nno indication that he deliberately omitted or falsified facts, favorable or unfavorable.\nInasmuch as all the facts point to Applicant\u2019s answer to Section 24 as being the result\nof a simple misunderstanding, I conclude no Personal Conduct (PC) DC applies here. \nSecond, the SOR also alleges that more generic personal conduct security\nconcerns arise from the fact Applicant gave his then-teenage daughter money to\nillegally purchase marijuana for his personal consumption. This allegation, which\nApplicant fully admits, is uniquely troubling. Such adult conduct, in light of all the other\nfacts, gives rise to PC DC AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly\ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which when combined with all available information supports a whole\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information). \nWhen Applicant fully disclosed and expressed contrition for his lapse in providing\nfamilial leadership when he chose to personally use an illegal drug, it was with regard to\nan adult choice he personally made. He made that choice with full knowledge of the\nlegal and professional repercussions it might cause him. Here, however, his conduct\nwas more pervasive. He did not simply abuse marijuana furtively or hide his personal\ndrug use \u2013 from his minor daughter or the young man he was helping to rehabilitate \u2013\nso as to maintain the facade of a role model. Nor did he simply \u201csmoke along\u201d with\nthem in what he described as the safety of his home. Rather than simply extend his\nown illegal activities to include his personal purchase of marijuana, he actively sought\nout the criminal involvement of others \u2013 his daughter, a minor undergoing a difficult\nphase, and a young man recently released from prison and undergoing rehabilitation. In\nso doing, he not only invited the complicity of those he was expected to protect and put\nthem in potential danger, but he condoned and encouraged their criminal activity for his\npersonal benefit. Such selfish conduct demonstrates exceptionally poor judgment and\nan overt disregard of the law. After careful consideration, none of the available PC MCs\napply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\n\n9\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a middle aged father of three adult children. He is an\naffable professional who takes pride in being the head of his family and a role model to\nhis children. For one brief 10-month period, due to a variety of genuine reasons, he\nillegally used marijuana. Applicant\u2019s past drug use can be mitigated to the extent it was\na brief period candidly detailed on his e-QIP which he is committed to never again\nrepeat.\nApplicant\u2019s candor, however, extended beyond his personal drug use into a more\ntroubling area. He invited the complicity of his minor daughter and a young, former\ninmate, undergoing personal rehabilitation to purchase marijuana for his own use. Such\nconduct displays uniquely poor judgment, with regard to Applicant\u2019s overt disregard of\nthe law and to his exploitation of both his daughter and the young man, which remains\nunmitigated. Because the applicable guidelines dictate that any doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for access to classified information must be resolved in\nfavor of the national security, clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He also contributed money when his friends \nwould purchase marijuana. Sometimes friends would share their drugs with him. He \nalso used other drugs during this time period. He estimated that he used cocaine about \nten times; methamphetamine twice; hallucinogenic mushrooms four times; and ecstasy \nfive times.2  \n \n \nApplicant and his friends were caught using marijuana in a dorm room by the \ncampus security. They were not arrested but were placed on school probation for a \nyear. He continued to smoke marijuana, but did it off campus. He also feels that his \ndrug use contributed to his not playing football in college, which is one of his regrets. \nHis grades in college were good, but he realizes that they could have been much better \nif he was not using drugs.3 \n \n \nApplicant continued to use drugs, but less frequently, after he graduated from \ncollege. His company had a policy against drug use and required a drug test as a \ncondition of employment. Applicant passed the test by abstaining from drugs for several \nweeks prior to the test. There were no additional tests after he was hired. His future wife \nworked for the same company as he did for about four months in 2004 to 2005. \nApplicant met her in November 2004. She was and is against illegal drugs and would \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 47-48, 55-56; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 59-62, 81-87; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 76-79; 87-88, 96-97. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nnot have dated a drug user. He decided to completely stop using illegal drugs. He has \nnot used illegal drugs since December 2004. They married in 2005.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father became sick and passed away in the summer of 2005. This \nalso spurred a change in Applicant. As the only son, he took charge of assisting his \nmother and his sisters. Family became more important to him. He works fairly long \nhours. He spends most of his off time with his wife, child and their families. They spend \nevery Tuesday night with his mother. He usually sees one of his sisters and her \nhusband during the visits. His other sister lives in another state. His father-in-law and \nmother-in-law are divorced. Applicant and his wife spend most Saturdays with her father \nand most Sundays with her mother. Applicant and his wife bought a townhouse in 2005. \nWith their growing family, they are in the process of buying a single family house. They \nwill put their townhouse up for rent.5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on October 24, 2006. He completely listed his illegal drug use in the \nQuestionnaire.6   \n \n \nApplicant stated that he has almost no contact with individuals that still use \ndrugs. Most of his friends from high school and college have stopped using drugs. He is \ninto fantasy sports leagues and is still is in contact telephonically with a friend that he \nused drugs with, who shares the same interest, but he no longer sees him. His friends \nknow that he no longer uses drugs, so if any are using, they do not do it in his presence. \nThe last time he was aware of a friend smoking marijuana was in March 2005, when he \nbelieves a friend was smoking marijuana in his room while Applicant and others were \noutside the house waiting for him.7  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he will never use illegal drugs again.8 He signed a \nstatement of intent on April 21, 2008, stating: \n \nI, [Applicant] have not abused [illegal] drugs since the end of 2004. I \nintend not to abuse drugs in the future and agree to automatic revocation \nof any security clearance I might have for any violation involving abuse of \ndrugs.9 \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 59-62, 89-92; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 59-62, 70; GE 1, 2. \n \n6 GE 1. \n \n7 Tr. at 70-72, 92-95, 98. \n \n8 Tr. at 72-73. \n \n9 AE H. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals indicate that he is a conscientious, dedicated, \nand highly-valued employee. He has been promoted five times since January 2004. He \nis now earning a significant salary. He is one of the top performers on his manager\u2019s \nteam. She testified that Applicant is ethical, very honest, trustworthy, and he has very \ngood judgment. His supervisor testified that Applicant has greatly matured since he \nbegan working with him in March 2005. He feels that the sudden illness and death of \nApplicant\u2019s father triggered a positive transformation in Applicant. He described \nApplicant as having a tremendous work ethic, detail-oriented, honest, and reliable. Both \nwitnesses are aware of his past drug use and both recommend him for a security \nclearance. Character letters on his behalf describe him with similar superlatives.10  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 16-42; AE A-G. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(b) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug purchase, possession, and use are sufficient to raise the above \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using illegal drugs up until about December 2004. He used \nmarijuana almost daily when he was in college. He also used other illegal drugs. After \nhe graduated college in 2002, he did not use as often, but his drug use continued. He \nmet his future wife in November 2004, and things started changing. She is vehemently \nanti-drug. He decided that he needed a change in his life and if he was going to have \nany chance with her, that he would have to give up drugs. They fell in love, got married, \nhad a baby, and his wife is pregnant with their second child. Family became very \nimportant to him, particularly after the sudden illness and passing of his father. He has \nnot used drugs in more than three years and is not around people who are using drugs. \nHe submitted \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation.\u201d I find that both AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 27 years old. He has \nclearly matured since he met his future wife in November 2004. They married, had a \nchild, and have another one on the way. His father passed away in 2005. Family and his \n\n \n7 \n \njob now dominate his life. He is highly regarded at work. He has received five \npromotions. His supervisor testified about how much Applicant has matured. His wife is \nvery opposed to drugs. Applicant realizes that drugs may have cost him a chance to \nplay college football. He does not want them to cost him his career and his family. It is \nnot unusual to see great changes in someone\u2019s life when they are in their twenties. \nApplicant has convinced me that he has changed. I am completely satisfied that illegal \ndrugs are no longer a part of his life. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug use.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On\nMarch 31, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether several of the findings\nby the Judge are erroneous because they fail to reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record\nevidence as a whole; (b) whether it was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law for the Judge to\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s misappropriation of funds from his employer was mitigated under\nGuideline J; and (c) whether the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions under the whole person concept are\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the record evidence as a whole.  For the following reasons, the\nBoard reverses the Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nFor about two years ending in May 2005, Applicant misappropriated approximately $8,500\nfrom the cash accounts of his employer, a small Christian college.  The misappropriated funds were\nmainly monies from campus vending machines.  Applicant was able to accomplish this because he\nhad worked for the college for more than 20 years and had risen to the position of vice president for\nadministration and chief financial officer.  Applicant used the money to supplement the per diem\nallowances of members of the college\u2019s traveling teams, to provide short-term loans to low-income\nemployees of the college, and occasionally to buy fast-food meals for himself when he was working\nlate.  In the past, he had supplemented the per diem and made the loans out of his own pocket.  Some\nof the loans were repaid, and some not.  Except for the occasional meal, he never used the money\nfor his own gain.\nApplicant attributed his actions to stress and frustration over the tight financial circumstances\nof the college, the tight finances of the city in which he lived and served as a city council member,\nand the failing health of his mother.  He admitted to a sense of entitlement and self-pity due to his\nyears of commitment to the college and frustration with poor decisions by the college president.\nHowever, he insisted that his feelings did not justify his conduct.\nIn May 2005, Applicant went to the college president and admitted the misconduct.  He was\nmotivated primarily by a guilty conscience, but also by his belief that newly hired auditors would\ndiscover the misuse of the funds.  Applicant had been pressuring the college for five years to replace\nauditors he considered to be sloppy and incompetent, and the new auditors he had recommended\n\nGovernment Exhibit 3 at pp. 4-5. \n2\n3\nwere reviewing the financial records.  Applicant made full restitution and resigned.  The college\u2019s\ngoverning body voted not to take civil or criminal action against Applicant.\nApplicant found work in June 2005 as a consultant on an auditing project.  He told his new\nemployer of the misconduct before he was hired.  After the project was over, that employer\nrecommended Applicant to her sister and brother-in-law for his current job, which involves classified\ncontracts.  The college president to whom Applicant admitted his misappropriation of funds, as well\nas others in responsible positions who are aware of it, submitted character references for Applicant,\nattesting to his trustworthiness.  Applicant has told his family of his misconduct, giving more detail\nto his wife and older children.  Applicant credibly testified as to his remorse.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less th an the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported bu substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel challenges several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings.  Specifically, it\nasserts that the record evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s findings that: (1) Applicant\u2019s use of\nmisappropriated funds for himself involved only the purchase of fast-food meals when he was\nworking late hours; (2) Applicant\u2019s misconduct occurred for a \u201cbrief time;\u201d (3) Applicant\u2019s\nmisconduct occurred under unusual circumstances and when Applicant was under unusual stress;\n(4) the misconduct was completely out of Applicant\u2019s character; and (5) Applicant was largely\nmotivated to confess by his guilty conscience.\nThe Judge found that, aside from the occasional fast-food meal, Applicant never used the\nmoney for personal gain.  In response to written interrogatories, Applicant indicated that the\nmisappropriated money he spent on himself was for \u201cpersonal expenses\u201d which he more specifically\ndescribed as \u201c mostly for eating out.\u201d   Thus, Department Counsel is correct in asserting that the\n2\nJudge\u2019s more restrictive finding was erroneous.\nConcerning the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s misconduct occurred \u201cfor a brief time,\u201d\nDepartment Counsel is correct in arguing that this finding is not supported by the record evidence\nand is incompatible with the Judge\u2019s own finding that Applicant\u2019s practice of misappropriating\nmoney entrusted to him took place over a period of about two years.  While the Board will not\nemploy specific measurements to establish the precise parameters of general terms like \u201cbrief,\u201d a\n\n4\ncourse of conduct taking place over a period of time such as two years cannot reasonably be\ndescribed as \u201cbrief.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel asserts on appeal that while there was some record evidence that the\nJudge could consider as supporting his findings that Applicant acted under \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances\nand under \u201cunusual\u201d stress, there is significant record evidence that does not support those findings.\nDepartment Counsel argues that various factors in the case, such as Applicant working long hours,\nhis dealing with financial problems as part of his duties with the college and the City Council, feeling\ndisgruntled with the college president over what Applicant perceived as fiscal mismanagement, and\nhealth problems of Applicant\u2019s mother were not particularly unusual.  After a review of the record\nas a whole, the Board is not prepared to conclude that there was insufficient evidence for the Judge\nto find that some unusual circumstances existed during the period of Applicant\u2019s misconduct.  The\nrecord indicates that the financial problems of both the college and the city became critical during\nthe time period in question, and Applicant began to harbor resentment over the situation at the\ncollege in particular.  Also, the stress brought on by Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s final illness was arguably\na factor.  As Department Counsel points out, however, none of these factors, as presented in the case,\nare of sufficient gravity to carry a great deal of significance and Applicant did not establish what\nstresses were operating upon him at any given period of time during his course of misconduct what\nthe specific connection was between those stresses and his course of conduct. Moreover, the record\nevidence also establishes that Applicant acted out of a sense of self-pity and feelings of entitlement.\nOn balance,  the Judge\u2019s finding of unusual circumstances and unusual stress, although sustainable,\nis not entitled to much weight in mitigation, considering the totality of the record evidence.     \nNext, Department Counsel takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s actions in\nmisappropriating funds to which he had been entrusted were \u201ccompletely out of Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter.\u201d  Department Counsel argues that it is implausible to characterize a course of knowing\nand deliberate conduct involving separate and discrete acts over a period of about two years as\ncompletely out of character.  This argument has merit.  The record evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s\nacts of misconduct and violations of his position of trust were repeated and took place over an\nextended period of time.  They occurred after another time period where Applicant developed\nfeelings of resentment, self-pity and entitlement.  These facts belie the notion that Applicant\u2019s acts\nwere completely out of character (i.e., a brief, largely inexplicable, or abrupt change in behavior).\n \nDepartment Counsel also takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant was largely\nmotivated to confess by his guilty conscience, and asserts that the finding is not supported by the\nweight of the record evidence in the case.  Department Counsel cites to numerous portions of the\nrecord where Applicant knew his transgressions would eventually be discovered by auditors.\nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant, before revealing his dishonesty, made various decisions\nthat were indicative of calculated self-interest rather than a guilty conscience.  After a review of the\nrecord, the Board concludes that the weight of the evidence supports Department Counsel\u2019s\nassertions.  The record contains a lengthy and detailed description of Applicant making the decision\nto disclose his misappropriations after he concluded that a new group of auditors at the college\nwould discover them.  Applicant also described how he allowed the audit to proceed for as long as\npossible before making his disclosures and waited until he had made financial arrangements to repay\n\n5\nthe college.  By contrast, the record contains only a single reference to Applicant being motivated\nby his conscience to make the disclosure.\nNot all of the factual errors made by the Judge are of equal magnitude.  However, when\nconsidered together, they work to significantly undercut the Judge\u2019s conclusions in favor of\nmitigation and his ultimate decision in favor of Applicant.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA. Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: The government established a case for\ndisqualification under Guideline J, but Applicant mitigated the security concerns.  While the\nmisconduct cannot be considered distant in time, the circumstances of the misconduct were unusual,\nand the misconduct itself completely out of character.  There has been no recurrence of the\nmisconduct; Applicant has made restitution; and his rehabilitation has been well documented.\nTellingly, his most important associates from the college vouch for his trustworthiness,\nnotwithstanding his misconduct.  It is extremely unlikely that Applicant will ever engage in this\nmisconduct again.  A whole-person analysis leads to the same result.  For a brief period of time when\nhe was under unusual stress, he breached his fiduciary duty to his employer.  For more than 20 years\nbefore the misconduct and for more than three years after his resignation, he has demonstrated his\nreliability and trustworthiness to his past and current employers.    \nB. Discussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \n\u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant,\ndeny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary\nto law because the Judge erroneously concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct was mitigated under\nGuideline J.  Department Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s conduct was\n\n\u201c[S]o much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n3\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d\n\u201c[T]he person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in\n4\nthe person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\n5\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\u201d\n6\nmitigated is not supported by the record evidence as a whole, and that record evidence of mitigation\nis not sufficient to warrant the Judge\u2019s application of Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 32.(a),3\nAdjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 32.(b),  and Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 32.(d).   Department Counsel\u2019s\n4\n5\nargument has merit.\nThe Judge\u2019s findings/conclusions that the circumstances of the misconduct were unusual and\ncompletely out of Applicant\u2019s character have been discussed in preceding paragraphs.  As stated\nearlier, the Board concludes that the record demonstrates that the circumstances Applicant found\nhimself in during the salient time period were not so unusual that much weight can be afforded them\nin terms of establishing mitigation.  The Board also stated earlier that the record does not support\nthe finding/conclusion that Applicant\u2019s actions were completely out of character.\nAdditionally, Department Counsel argues that the Judge erred by concluding that: there has\nbeen no recurrence of Applicant\u2019s misconduct; Applicant made restitution; Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation\nis well-documented; Applicant\u2019s associates vouch for his trustworthiness notwithstanding his\nmisconduct; a former employer recommended Applicant for his current position; and it is extremely\nunlikely that Applicant would ever engage in his misconduct again.  Applicant misappropriated the\nfunds to which he had been entrusted beginning in 2004 and up to May 2005.  Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that the Judge could not reasonably place much weight on the absence of\nevidence that the criminal conduct has not recurred, particularly where there is no evidence that\nApplicant has been entrusted with the handling of money as a fiduciary since that time.  Department\nCounsel persuasively argues that the Judge could not reasonably accord much weight to Applicant\u2019s\nrestitution, where the restitution was made after Applicant became afraid that auditors would catch\nhim and where his request was coupled with a request that he keep his job.  There is a paucity of\nrecord evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation in this case.  No corroborating witnesses or\ndocuments concerning job performance or other achievements were produced that would support\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation is \u201cwell documented.\u201d  The six one-page\ncharacter letters Applicant offered as evidence focus on Applicant\u2019s life and conduct prior to the\nmisappropriations and do not speak in detail about Applicant\u2019s status or performance as a fiduciary\nsince May 2005.  In general, the weight that the Judge could reasonably afford the six character\nletters is limited given the fact that in four of them, the authors do not give any indication that they\nare aware of the relevant details of Applicant\u2019s misconduct.  Indeed, two of the letters do not\nmention Applicant\u2019s misconduct at all.  Thus, there was no basis in the record evidence for the judge\n\n7\nto conclude that Applicant\u2019s associates \u201c. . . vouch for his trustworthiness notwithstanding his\nmisconduct. . . .\u201d  \nTo summarize, given the sparse favorable record evidence in this case and the fact that the\nburden of proof rested with Applicant to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns, the Judge\nerred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s conduct was mitigated under Guideline J.\nThe Judge largely repeats his Guideline J conclusions when making his whole-person\nanalysis.  The only additional factor in the Judge\u2019s analysis is his emphasis on the 20-year period\nbefore Applicant\u2019s acts of criminal misconduct and the 3 unblemished years since the misconduct.\nDepartment Counsel successfully argues that, on this record, the significance placed on this evidence\nby the Judge is unwarranted and erroneously downplays the significance of Applicant\u2019s\nmisappropriation of college funds to which he had been entrusted for a period of two years.  The\nJudge\u2019s favorable conclusions under his whole person analysis are not sustainable.  \n \nConclusion\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, Department Counsel has identified errors by the\nJudge which, taken in their entirety, warrant reversal of the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance\ndecision.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant answered the SOR 19 by an undated letter received by\n1\nDOHA 11 December 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me\n10 January 2008, and I convened a hearing 6 February 2008. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) 19 February 2008.\n \nMarch 31, 2008\n\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s credit report (G.E. 2) reflects the two alleged debts, Applicant\u2019s evidence indicates that the\n2\ndebts at SOR 2.a. (A.E. B) and SOR 2.b. (A.E. C) were posted to the credit report in error.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the Guideline J SOR allegation. Accordingly, I incorporate his\nadmission as fact. He denied the Guideline F allegations.  He is a 45-year-old chief\n2\nfinancial officer (CFO) employed by a defense contractor since January 2007. He has\nnot previously held a clearance. He has been married over 20 years and has six\nchildren.\nFor about two years before May 2005, Applicant misappropriated approximately\n$8,500 from the cash accounts of his employer, a small, private, Christian college. He\nwas able to accomplish this misappropriation\u2014mostly money from campus vending\nmachines\u2014because of his position as vice president for administration and chief\nfinancial officer, a position he had reached after more than 20 years at the college.\nApplicant used the money to supplement the per diem of the college\u2019s traveling teams\u2019\nmembers, both athletic and academic, to provide short-term loans to low income\nemployees of the college, and\u2014occasionally\u2014to buy himself fast-food meals on nights\nhe was working late. In the past, he had supplemented the per diem and made loans\nout of his own pocket. Sometimes the loans were paid, sometimes not. Aside from the\noccasional fast-meal, he never used the money for personal gain.\nApplicant attributed his misappropriations to the stresses of dealing with the tight\nfinances of the college, dealing with the tight finances of the city where he then served\nas a city council member, and the debilitating final illness of his mother. He also\nadmitted his sense of entitlement/self-pity born of a lifetime of commitment to the\ncollege and his frustration over what he considered some poor financial and personnel\ndecisions of the college president. Notwithstanding his motivations, he categorically\ninsisted that these did not justify his conduct.\nIn May 2005, Applicant went to the college president and advised him of the\nmisappropriated funds. He was largely motivated to confess by his guilty conscience,\nbut also by his knowledge that new auditors would uncover the cash shortages.\nApplicant had been pressing the college for five years to replace auditors he considered\nsloppy and incompetent, and had finally succeeded in getting the college to hire his\nrecommended auditors. Applicant made restitution to the college, and resigned. The\ngoverning body of the college voted to take no civil or criminal action against Applicant.\nIn June 2005, Applicant went to work as a consultant on an auditing project (G.E.\n1). He told the certified public accountant (CPA) who hired him about his misconduct\nduring his interview for the job. Nevertheless, she trusted him with access to company\nproprietary information and now recommends him for access to classified information.\nShe considers his misconduct a one-time lapse (A.E. B). She recommended him to her\nsister and brother-in-law when the company they own (Applicant\u2019s current employer)\nneeded a CFO, knowing that the company handled classified contracts.\n\n3\nSimilarly, the college president (and former vice president for academic affairs)\nwho accepted Applicant\u2019s resignation has known Applicant since 1984, considers the\ncircumstances leading to his resignation as isolated and aberrant, and specifically\nvouches for his trustworthiness (A.E. B). Applicant\u2019s pastor (and the man who hired him\nas the college business manager in 1984), trusted him with the college\u2019s finances and\nwith leadership responsibilities in the church, also considers Applicant\u2019s misconduct out\nof character and would trust him with classified information (A.E. B). Other long-term\nassociates from the college, including the former athletic director, director of facilities, as\nwell as co-workers, subordinates, and supervisors (in some capacities), voice the same\nopinion of his trustworthiness.\nApplicant\u2019s family is aware of his misconduct. His three older children know why\nhe had to leave the college; his three minor children know only that he had to leave. His\ntestimony at hearing was credible, and his remorse for his misconduct evident. He was\noffered a position of financial responsibility in his new church, which he discretely\ndeclined with his pastor (who he told of his past issues).\nPolicies\nThe RAG are factors to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances\npresented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant.\nHowever, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence\nas a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n4\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n\u00b632.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\n5\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) the person was pressured . . . into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence or criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement;\n4\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J by\nestablishing Applicant\u2019s two-year course of misconduct resulting in his resignation from\nhis employer of over 20 years.  However, Applicant mitigated the security concerns.\n4\nWhile the misconduct cannot be considered distant in time, the circumstances of the\nmisconduct were unusual, and the misconduct itself completely out of Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter. Further, there has been no recurrence of the misconduct, Applicant made\nrestitution, and his rehabilitation is well documented.  Tellingly, his most important\n5\nassociates from the college vouch for his trustworthiness notwithstanding his\nmisconduct, and a former employer recommended him to family for his current position.\nI consider it extremely unlikely Applicant would ever engage in this misconduct again. I\nresolve Guideline J for Applicant.\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline F.\nApplicant\u2019s evidence from the alleged creditors demonstrates that the debts were\nimproperly entered on to his credit reports. I resolve Guideline F for Applicant.\nA whole person analysis leads to the same result. For a brief period of time when\nhe was under unusual stress, he breached his fiduciary duty to his employer. He offers\nno justification for his conduct, but made restitution and resigned. For more than 20\nyears before the misconduct and for more than three years after his resignation, he has\ndemonstrated his reliability and trustworthiness to his past and current employers.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

She is a 36-year-old information engineer employed by a defense contractor\nsince April 1997. She seeks to retain the clearance she has held since March 1998.\nApplicant has a 10-year history of excessive alcohol consumption, punctuated by\nfour alcohol-related incidents: a June 1994 conviction for operating under the influence\nof liquor (OUIL), a March 1997 conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol\n(DUI), an October 2003 conviction for DUI, and a July 2004 arrest for public\nintoxication\u2014for which she paid a fine. During these 10 years, Applicant estimated her\nalcohol consumption as 4-6 drinks twice per week. She successfully completed the\nsentencing requirements of each of her convictions.\nAt the time of the July 2004 arrest, she was still under probation for her October\n2003 DUI. She did not believe that she was intoxicated at the time of the arrest, but paid\nthe fine on-line without contesting the citation. However, she was summoned to a show\ncause hearing on her probation. The magistrate apparently accepted her explanation\nthat she was not intoxicated at the time of the arrest, because she continued her on\nprobation.\nApplicant\u2019s 1994 and 1997 convictions were initially adjudicated during her first\nbackground investigation in 1998. In January 1998 she was interviewed by a\ngovernment investigator. During the interview she stated her intent to not drive under\nthe influence of alcohol in the future. She was ultimately granted the clearance that is at\nissue.\nApplicant describes her current alcohol consumption as a couple of glasses of\nwine when out to dinner with her friends, no more than twice a month. She sometimes\nhas a glass of wine with her dinner at home. She no longer goes out to bars with her\nfriends. When she is going out to dinner with her friends and expects that she will be\ndrinking, she makes arrangements to avoid driving herself. She has adopted a healthier\nlifestyle, eating better and going to the gym regularly. She has not been diagnosed as\nalcohol dependent or an alcohol abuse.\nApplicant\u2019s employment evaluations (A.E. A) are uniformly excellent, and her\nwork references (A.E. B) consider her extremely trustworthy. However, it does not\nappear that any of them are aware of the SOR allegations. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\n\u00b622.(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or\nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; . . . (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n3\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline G, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s 10-year history of alcohol abuse, punctuated by alcohol-\nrelated arrests in June 1994, March 1997, October 2003, and July 2004.  However,\n3\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. Neither the prior adjudication of the 1994 and\n1997 convictions, nor the six-year gap between the 1997 and 2003 convictions,\nprecludes the government from revisiting her alcohol consumption over the entire 10\nyears. Nevertheless, Applicant acknowledged her past problems with alcohol, and took\nsteps to reduce her consumption, and avoid circumstances that had previously been\n\n4\n\u00b623.(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent)\nor responsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n5\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n6\n\u00b632.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence or criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement;\n7\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ;\n4\ntroublesome for her.  Her avoidance of bars, arranging alternate transportation\n4\nwhenever she contemplates consuming alcohol while with her friends, and her changes\nto a healthier daily routine demonstrate that Applicant is committed to consuming\nalcohol responsibly. I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse alcohol in the future.\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline G for Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J by\nestablishing Applicant\u2019s four alcohol-related convictions between June 1994 and July\n2004.  However, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. While the misconduct\n5\ncannot be considered distant in time, the criminal conduct was inextricably connected to\nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption. Given my conclusion that Applicant is\nunlikely to abuse alcohol in the future, I consider it extremely unlikely Applicant would\never engage in this misconduct again.  I resolve Guideline J for Applicant.\n6\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.7\nThe questionable judgment shown by driving under the influence of alcohol is not made\nmore questionable by having previously stated an intent to avoid such conduct in the\nfuture.Furthermore, returning to responsible drinking practices demonstrates good\njudgment, as does the passage of more than five years since the last DUI. I resolve\nGuideline E for Applicant.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which he contends showed that he had\npaid off most of his outstanding debts by the time the case was submitted for decision.  As part of\nhis argument, Applicant also contends that the credit reports offered as evidence by the government\nwere not current and were not indicative of his current financial status.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do\nnot demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nApplicant elected to have a decision based on the written record.  He filed a short response\nto the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), which included a more recent credit report.\nApplicant\u2019s response, however, did not object to the credit reports contained in the government\u2019s\nFORM, and the Judge specifically considered the more recent credit report submitted by Applicant\nin reaching his decision.  Decision at 2-3.  The Judge based his adverse findings, in substantial part,\non the fact that Applicant had submitted no \u201cproof-of-payment\u201d paperwork as to individual debts,\nsuch as account statements or cancelled checks, and \u201cno evidence showing the value of any financial\nassets or investments.\u201d  Id. at 3-4.  He then went on to conclude that: \u201cGiven the lack of\ndocumentation in this case, [Applicant\u2019s] claims, representations, and estimations cannot be accepted\nas facts that a reasonable person might accept as reliable evidence.\u201d  Id. at 6.  The Board has\npreviously noted that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about\nthe satisfaction of individual debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17520 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 20,\n2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  Applicant offered little in the way of mitigating evidence and, at the time the case was\n\n3\nsubmitted for decision, he was still in the process of trying to resolve his financial problems.  The\nJudge weighed the limited mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented\nin mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on November 7, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems.   \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nApril 22, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n The documents attached to the government\u2019s brief are described as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n3\nherein. \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on December 18, 2007. Thereafter, in January\n2008, he indicated he did not wish to have a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be\ndecided based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn February 20, 2008, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant on February 27  and it was\n3\nth\nreceived by him on March 8 . Applicant replied to the FORM with a one-page\nth\nmemorandum plus attachments on March 31 . Collectively, his response will be\nst\nconsidered as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me April 17, 2008. For\nthe reasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges five delinquent or past-due debts ranging\nfrom $536 to $14,786 for about $24,824 in total; it also alleges Applicant was 120-days\npast due on a real estate mortgage. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted two\ndebts and the past-due real estate mortgage, and he denied three debts. Based on the\nrecord evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in July\n2000 and divorced in December 2001; he has no children. His educational background\nincludes a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 1996. \nHis employment history includes serving as an active duty Army officer from\nAugust 1996 through January 2005 (Exhibit 4).

He is currently working in Afghanistan in support of\nU.S. military operations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems that date back to his time in the\nArmy. In his response to the SOR, Applicant agreed that he is a poor financial planner,\nbut says it has no effect on his job. The debts alleged in the SOR are addressed below.\n\n3\nThe first account is described as a collection account for $7,865 (SOR \u00b6 1.a).\nAccording to an October 2005 credit report, the account originated in December 2001\nas an automobile loan (Exhibit 5). It closed in October 2003 due to repossession with a\nbalance due of $5,537. Credit reports from 2007 put the balance at $7,784 and $7,865\n(Exhibits 6 and 8). Applicant described this account in his security-clearance application\nas a satisfied repossession (Exhibit 1). In his response to the FORM, he indicated this\ndebt should be paid off within the next month. Otherwise, he submitted no paperwork on\nthis account. \nThe second account is described as a collection account for $14,786 (SOR \u00b6\n1.b). The account originated in May 1999 as an automobile loan (Exhibit 5). It closed in\nApril 2001 with a balance of $18,853 of which $14,786 was past due. In his response to\ninterrogatories, Applicant noted that no judgment has been obtained and the account\nwas more than seven years old (Exhibit 7). Otherwise, he submitted no paperwork on\nthis account.\nThe third account is described as a past-due account for $885 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The\naccount originated in October 2004 as an unsecured installment loan (Exhibit 5). It was\n120-days or more past due; the total balance on the account is $5,633. He denied the\naccount in his response to the SOR, he did not address it in his response to\ninterrogatories, and he did not address it in his response to the FORM.\nThe fourth account is described as a past-due account for $752 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The\naccount originated as a telephone account; it became seriously past due and was\nassigned for collection with a balance of $752 (Exhibit 5). He denied the account in his\nresponse to the SOR, and he claimed he paid it in 2005 in his response to\ninterrogatories. He did not provide proof-of-payment for the account (for example,\naccount statement, cancelled check, or some other paperwork).\nThe fifth account is described as a past-due account for $536 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The\naccount originated as a telephone account; it became past due and was placed for\ncollection with a balance of $536 (Exhibit 5). He denied the account in his response to\nthe SOR, and he claimed he paid it in 2005 in his response to interrogatories. He did not\nprovide proof-of-payment for the account. \nThe sixth account is described as a past-due real estate mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.f).\nApplicant made catch-up payments (for example, $5,000 in September 2007), and the\naccount is now current (Exhibits 7 and A).\nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant has addressed other accounts\n(Exhibit A). In March 2008, he brought current and paid off a credit card account with a\npayment of $5,624. He paid off an unsecured $3,500 loan with two $1,000 payments in\nMarch 2008. Also in March 2008, he paid off a $761 telephone account that was in a\ncollection or charged-off status.

His\nannual income is unknown, but an earnings statement as of September 14, 2007,\nshows Applicant had a gross income of about $55,231 (Exhibit 7). The same document\nalso shows he is paying on a 401(k) loan. There is no evidence showing what Applicant\nmay have in checking or savings accounts. Likewise, there is no evidence showing the\nvalue of any financial assets or investments. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant\n5\nto be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n15\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n5\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n17\n18\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are troubling, as they reveal that Applicant\nwas negligent with car loans and telephone accounts. Defaulting on two car loans as an\nactive duty Army officer can only be described as gross negligence. Likewise, the past-\ndue real estate mortgage shows a lack of concern and carelessness. The same facts\nand circumstances support a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \n\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,\n19\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n20\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 (scope of appellate review for findings of fact). \n21\n Examples of other large bureaucratic institutions that rely heavily on documentation include banks,\n22\ninsurance companies, hospitals, universities, and the Armed Forces. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n23\n6\nThe mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and two\ndeserve discussion. The first is MC 2, which takes into account conditions beyond a\nperson\u2019s control provided they acted reasonably under the circumstances.  No doubt,\n19\nApplicant\u2019s failed marriage during 2000\u20132001 and his brief period of unemployment in\n2005 caused him some financial pain. But at this point, Applicant can no longer use\nthose events as an excuse. Accordingly, MC 2 does not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe other pertinent mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to\ninitiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.20\nApplicant has resolved one of the six accounts alleged in the SOR by bringing his real\nestate mortgage current (SOR \u00b6 1.f). But the other five accounts in the SOR remain\nunresolved. In addition to the mortgage, he brought current and paid off a credit card\naccount as well as a delinquent telephone account. Given these circumstances,\nApplicant receives some credit, but not full credit, under MC 4.  \nApplicant is a 33-year-old former Army officer who is old enough to act\nresponsibly and make prudent decisions about his finances. But the record evidence\nshows otherwise. He has had two car loans in collection for years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b).\nFor the first, he says he will resolve it within the next month. For the second, he appears\nto be ignoring it based on its age. He also has three past-due accounts that are\nunresolved (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e). He failed to address one account, and he failed\nto provide proof-of-payment for the two accounts he claims to have paid.\nGiven the lack of documentation in this case, his claims, representations, and\nestimations cannot be accepted as facts that a reasonable person might accept as\nreliable evidence.  Large bureaucratic institutions\u2014like the Defense Department and\n21\nthe security-clearance programs it administers\u2014do not run on word-of-mouth.  They\n22\nrun on documentation. With the benefit of a college education and military experience,\nApplicant should be well aware of this concept. The documentation can be stored\nelectronically or on paper, but it is up to Applicant to produce reliable evidence, to\ninclude documentary evidence, to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts\nadmitted by him and proven by the record evidence.  Although Applicant is not legally\n23\nrequired to produce documentary evidence to prevail, the lack of documentation in a\n\n7\nfinancial case makes it difficult to reach a favorable decision under the clearly-\nconsistent standard. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 26, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 30, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because it \u201c. . . is\nbased on inconsistent leveraging of the facts/mitigating circumstances in [t]estimony and the factual\ntime lines and sequence of events.\u201d  In support of his contention, Applicant summarizes the evidence\nhe presented at the hearing, and argues that it is sufficient to support a favorable decision under the\nwhole-person concept.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge erred. \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.\nSee also Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).\n \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations, including the failure to file federal income tax returns for three years.  At the time of the\nhearing, Applicant still had a significant outstanding debt, in the form of an unresolved judgment\nfor rent, for which he was unable to provide proof of satisfaction.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge\ncould reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered\nby Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the\npossible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to some\nof the SOR allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de\nnovo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App.\nBd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\n\n3\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On \nNovember 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 10, 2007; answered it \non January 2, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on January 7, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non January 31, 2008, and the case was assigned an administrative judge on February \n4, 2008. It was reassigned to me on February 6, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non February 7, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 29, 2008. \nApril 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record \nopen until March 17, 2008, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted AX A through N, and they were admitted without objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s responses to AX A through N are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits \n(HX) I and II. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 10, 2008. The \nrecord closed on March 17, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nUnauthenticated Report of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 4, a personal subject interview extracted from a \nreport of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he \nwaived it (Tr. 28). Accordingly, I admitted GX 4.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR \nexcept \u00b6 1.e. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old senior designer, working for a defense contractor at a \nshipyard. He has worked for his current employer since January 1992. He has a high \nschool education and some technical training. He is married and has a 28-year-old son. \nHis supervisors describe him as trustworthy, knowledgeable, and hard-working (AX E, \nF, and N). He first received a clearance in March 1974. It was withdrawn during one of \nhis changes of employment but has been restored since 1992. \n \n \nDuring his career, Applicant has worked in shipyards throughout the country. \nWhile working in the southern U.S., he learned his grandmother was in poor health and \nwas not receiving proper care. He moved to the northeast U.S. to care for her. He lived \nwith his grandmother and remodeled her house. When his grandmother passed away in \nthe late 1990s, his parents told him they had sold their house to his older brother and \nintended to move into his grandmother\u2019s house, leaving him to find another home (Tr. \n32-33). \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased a condominium. Shortly thereafter, the \ncondominium complex was auctioned and sold, and the mortgage lenders notified \ncondominium owners that their property was worth about half its previous value, and \nthat they would be required to pay the difference in value (AX J at 1). Applicant was \nunable to refinance his mortgage, and he had insufficient income to pay his mortgage \nand credit card debts. He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a discharge in \nDecember 1999 (Tr. 33-34). The bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nWhen he filed for bankruptcy protection, he moved out of his condominium and \nleased an apartment. His relationship with his landlord became adversarial because his \nlandlord refused to maintain the apartment. After the son of another tenant was arrested \nfor making a bomb threat, Applicant decided to move out. The landlord wanted \nApplicant to buy out the remainder of the lease, and Applicant refused. Applicant \napparently stopped paying rent. In November 2000, the landlord filed a complaint for \neviction and nonpayment of rent and obtained a judgment against him for $2,781 (GX \n5). The judgment is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \nApplicant was unable to pay the judgment immediately because he did not have \nhis checkbook or sufficient cash with him at the courthouse (Tr. 37, 51). In his answer to \nthe SOR and at the hearing, Applicant asserted he had paid the judgment, either by \ncheck or money order, but he had no documentary evidence of payment (Tr. 39, 49).  \n \n \nApplicant testified he is unable to provide documentary proof that he paid the \njudgment because all his personal records were destroyed. After he moved out of the \napartment, he stored his personal belongings and all his records at his father\u2019s home, \nthe same place where his grandmother had passed away. After his father passed away \nin June 2001, his three older brothers took all of Applicant\u2019s personal property and \nrecords and disposed of them at the local dump (Tr. 38-39). At the hearing, Applicant \nstated he needed to \u201cgo back and quietly find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d He declared his \nintention to \u201cwrite a check to [the landlord] this year and ask him to please go close out \nthis documentation because I don\u2019t need it chasing me into the future\u201d (Tr. 50). \nApplicant did not present any post-hearing evidence of action to satisfy the judgment. \n \n \nApplicant failed to file his federal income tax return for 2001, and was notified \nthat he owed more than $5,000 in federal income taxes (Tr. 58; GX 2 at 8). He testified \nthat he forgot to file his income tax return because of the bankruptcy and the death in \nthe family. In January 2004 he was notified he owed an additional $684 in federal \nincome taxes. This tax liability arose because he did not realize that taxes were not \nwithheld from his pay for off-duty teaching (Tr. 64). In September 2007, he initiated a \npayroll deduction to pay off delinquent taxes plus interest and penalties (GX 2 at 8). He \nfailed to file his returns for 2002 and 2003 until October 15, 2007, after he received \nDOHA interrogatories about his financial situation (GX 2 at 16-17). He offered no \nexplanation for his failures to file the returns for 2002 and 2003. He eventually received \nrefunds for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004 (AX B, C, D, and M at 1). He filed his 2007 \nreturn on time and apparently is entitled to a refund (AX I). The delinquent taxes, \npenalties, and interest for the earlier years have been paid in full (AX H and M at 2-3). \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies and failures to file are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a delinquent cell phone service account. Applicant \ntestified a dispute arose about charges for unwanted services that he did not know he \nwas receiving. During a cell phone conversation with a customer service representative \nwhile he was driving his car, he became angry and threw the cell phone out the window \n(Tr. 41-43). He testified this incident \u201cwas a business part of my life that had nothing to \ndo with my ability to maintain a security clearance\u201d (Tr. 54). Applicant admitted the debt \n\n \n4 \n \n \nin his answer to the SOR, but pointed out that he continues to have cell phone service \nwith the same carrier and pays his bills on-line and on time (Answer to SOR; Tr. 70). \nThe debt apparently was some combination of an early-termination penalty and the \ncharges for unwanted services. The cell phone provider\u2019s continuation of service and \nthe fact that the alleged debt does not appear on his most recent credit report submitted \nby the government (GX 3) strongly suggests the cell phone provider\u2019s claim was \nabandoned or compromised.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement on October 15, 2007, \nreflecting net monthly income of $4,150, expenses of $2,812, debt payments of $363, \nand a remainder of $975. His payments on a car loan, unsecured personal loan and a \ncredit card account are current (GX 2 at 5). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 in pertinent part \nas follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  AG \u00b6 \n19(g) is raised by Afailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.@   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). His failure to file \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003 raises AG \u00b6 19(g). AG \u00b6 \n19(b) is not raised because there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), (e), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is established for the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f, but it is not established for Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax \nreturns, because he did not file the 2002 and 2003 returns until he received the DOHA \ninterrogatories in October 2007. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established \nbecause of his multiple delinquent debts. The third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is \nestablished for the bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a), triggered by an unforeseen and calamitous \ndrop in property values; and the rent dispute (SOR \u00b6 1.e), triggered by the indifference \nof a \u201cslumlord\u201d and Applicant\u2019s misguided attempt to resolve the dispute by withholding \nrent payments.  \n \n \nThe final prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) is not established. Applicant \nfirst received a clearance in 1974 and has held a clearance continuously since 1992, \napparently without incident. He is highly regarded by his supervisors. He has weathered \nseveral personal crises, including the illness and death of his grandmother, the financial \ndisaster involving his condominium, the deaths of his parents, and the destruction of his \npersonal property, mementoes, and personal records by his older brothers. However, \nhe does not believe that his personal conduct is relevant to holding a security clearance. \nHe did not initiate his payroll deductions for delinquent taxes until September 2007, and \nhe did not file his returns for 2002 and 2003 until he received the DOHA interrogatories \nin October 2007. His financial track record since 1999 raises doubt about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy was the result of an unexpected downturn in the value of \nhis condominium, and he acted responsibly by attempting to pay his bills and then \nseeking bankruptcy protection. However, his remaining debts were the product of \ninattention, ill-advised withholding of rent, and anger directed toward his cell phone \nprovider. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established only for the bankruptcy. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. Applicant has not \nreceived counseling. His federal income taxes are under control, and his cell phone \nprovider has apparently forgiven the charges alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but the judgment for \nunpaid rent is unresolved. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is established for all the allegations \nexcept 1.e. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition in 1999 \nwas a reasonable and prudent response to the financial crisis he experienced. \nHowever, he did not initiate his payroll deductions to pay his delinquent taxes until \nSeptember 2007, and he did not file his tax returns for 2002 and 2003 until he received \nthe DOHA interrogatories in October 2007. Although the cell phone issue apparently is \nresolved, it was not due to any affirmative action on Applicant\u2019s part. The debt for \nunpaid rent is unresolved. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the bankruptcy but \nnot for the remaining allegations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has held a security clearance for many years \nwithout incident. The DOHA interrogatories motivated him to resolve his income tax \nproblems. However, at the hearing he still persisted in his belief that the \u201cbusiness part\u201d \nof his life had nothing to do with his ability to hold a clearance. He was candid and \nstraightforward at the hearing. His memory of events was vague at times, clouded by \nthe passage of time, but he was credible. His financial track record and his attitude \nabout the irrelevance of his personal life to suitability for a clearance leave me with \nconcern whether his financial problems will recur. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR,\ndated January 10, 2008, admitted the SOR allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.c,\n1.e, and 1.i, denied all other allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 25, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued\non January 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for February 20, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMarch 27, 2008\n\n Applicant also stated in his response to the interrogatories that he would follow up with other credit\n2\nreporting agencies and \u201cmake payment arrangements as necessary\u201d on this debt.  \n2\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5, and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified and submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-3, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript\nwas received on February 28, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 38 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor, currently\nas a security specialist, since November 2005. He was employed by a private company as\na security officer assigned to his current employer from May 2005 to November 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor considers him to be a valued employee who has\n\u201cconsistently demonstrated strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty and reliability\nof the highest level.\u201d (AE 3)\nIn his May 2006 security clearance application, Applicant listed high school\nattendance from September 1985 to June 1988, and receipt of a general educational\ndevelopment (GED) certificate in December 1999. However, he testified he graduated from\nhigh school in or about 1988. (Tr. p. 7) He also listed enlisted service in the U.S. Army from\nFebruary 1989 to January 1997, without specifying whether it was active, active reserve,\nor inactive reserve. In response to an interrogatory requesting production of a DD 214,\nApplicant submitted a letter from the National Personnel Records Center that verified his\nreserve service but which also stated no DD 214 was ever issued because he either had\nno active service or less than 90 consecutive days of active duty for training. (GE 2) He\nsubmitted a security clearance application in May 2006 (GE 1), in which he reported a\nseries of jobs, and periods of unemployment from November 2003 to May 2005, August\n2001 to February 2002, and February 1999 to September 2000.\n \nApplicant was married in April 1988, and has been separated from his wife since\nSeptember 1997. He has three children from that marriage who were born in May 1988,\nMarch 1989, and July 1999. Applicant does not pay child support or alimony to his wife, but\ntestified he has an arrangement with his wife whereby he provides for the children on a\nrandom basis. (Tr. pp. 44-45)    \nIn his SOR response, Applicant claimed the delinquent debts alleged in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g had been resolved. In the response to\ninterrogatories he executed on September 20, 2007 (GE 2), he stated he either had\npreviously successfully disputed or was currently disputing the debts alleged in\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1h,  and 1.i. As to the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d,\n2\nApplicant stated in the response to interrogatories that he would contact that creditor and\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n3\nmake arrangements to resolve the debt. In the two documents, he consistently admitted\nowing the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.e, totaling $38,140.\nApplicant testified the debts listed in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f have been paid\nand that he does not recognize the creditor listed in subparagraph 1.g. (Tr. pp. 34-39) He\nfailed to present any receipts proving payment and testified none were available. He also\ntestified he still owes the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.i, totaling\n$39,860. (Tr. pp. 35-41) Further, he testified he had made arrangements with the creditor\nto make two payments of $800 to satisfy the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i with the first\npayment due in January 2008, but that he had been financially unable to make the\npayment as agreed. (Tr. pp. 41-42) Finally, he admits he has not paid the creditor listed\nin subparagraph 1.h and does not know why that debt is no longer listed in his credit\nreports. (Tr. pp. 40-41)\nThe debts alleged in the SOR became delinquent and/or were charged off or\nsubmitted for collection as far back as December 2000 and as recently as October 2006.\nIn addition to the periods of unemployment noted earlier, Applicant attributes his financial\nproblems to the more recent need to support his live-in girlfriend who was unemployed for\nalmost two years. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s wages are being garnished for 10% of his\nincome to satisfy a judgment for unpaid rent that arose about the time he separated from\nhis wife. There is a balance of almost $30,000 remaining to be paid through the\ngarnishment. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend once again became employed several months ago and\nhe believes her financial contributions to their household expenses will assist him in\nsatisfying his remaining delinquent creditors.        \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\n\n Department of the Navy v.

Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG]) 18\nApplicant allowed numerous debts to become delinquent which were then either\ncharged off or submitted for collection. His admitted outstanding delinquencies that are\nalleged in the SOR total almost $40,000.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napplies.\nApplicant\u2019s several periods of unemployment contributed significantly to his financial\nproblems. However, until relatively recently he took minimal to no action to pay his\n\n5\ndelinquent debts when he was employed and instead aggravated his financial problems\nby opting to support an unemployed girlfriend instead of applying funds he would have\notherwise had available to creditors. Accordingly, he is entitled to only minimal application\nof MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant has not received financial counselling and his financial problems are\nongoing and unlikely to be resolved in the near future. Thus, MC 20(c): the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(a): the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment do not apply\n \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him nor\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG K, Handling Protected Information, and one allegation under AG E, Personal Conduct. Applicant denied all allegations in the SOR. (Answer to SOR.) Applicant is 36 years old, married, and the mother of two young children. From 1992 to 1996, she served on active duty in the United States Navy and held a security clearance. In 2000, she earned an Associate of Arts degree in computer information systems. She is employed by a government contractor. As a government contract employee, she has held a security clearance and has been trained in the protection of classified information. (Ex. 1; Tr. 120-122, 161-162.) The SOR alleges four incidents in which Applicant deliberately or negligently failed to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other protected information. The first incident occurred in May 2002, when Applicant was employed as a supervisor in a government contractor\u2019s asset management program. Her job required that she maintain an inventory of all classified computers used by the contractor, and she was responsible, as a supervisor, for certifying that any classified hard drives were 3 removed from computers before they were assigned to surplus or released to individuals or groups outside of the organization.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Leslie McAdoo Gordon, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I \nconclude that Applicant rebutted and mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns \nunder Guideline K, Handling Protected Information, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \nHer eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on March 22, 2007. On October 9, 2008, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline K, Handling Protected \nInformation, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn December 29, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. She elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 26, 2009. I convened a hearing on April 1, 2009 to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced three exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 3 and admitted to the record without objection.  The Government \nprovided the following provisions from the National Industrial Security Program \nOperating Manual (NISPOM) for administrative notice: Chapter 5, Section 1 and Section \n3 (January 1995); Chapter 5, Section 1 and Section 3 (February 28, 2006). The \nGovernment\u2019s administrative notice documents were marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. \n \n Applicant testified on her own behalf and called three witnesses. She introduced \n12 exhibits, which were identified and marked as Ex. A through Ex. L. Ex. A was \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel objected to the admission of a \nparagraph in Ex. B that appeared at the bottom of page one and the top of page two of \nthe exhibit. I sustained the objection and agreed not to give the paragraph weight in my \nconsideration of the evidence. The remainder of Ex. B was admitted without objection. \nEx. C and D were admitted without objection. Department Counsel objected to a \nsentence in Ex. E as speculative. Applicant withdrew the sentence from Ex. E, and the \nexhibit was then admitted without objection. Ex. F through Ex. L were then admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant provided two documents for administrative notice, which \nwere marked as HE 2 and HE 3.   \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on April 10, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG K, Handling \nProtected Information, and one allegation under AG E, Personal Conduct. Applicant \ndenied all allegations in the SOR. (Answer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, married, and the mother of two young children. From \n1992 to 1996, she served on active duty in the United States Navy and held a security \nclearance. In 2000, she earned an Associate of Arts degree in computer information \nsystems. She is employed by a government contractor.  As a government contract \nemployee, she has held a security clearance and has been trained in the protection of \nclassified  information. (Ex. 1; Tr. 120-122, 161-162.)  \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges four incidents in which Applicant deliberately or negligently \nfailed to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other protected \ninformation. The first incident occurred in May 2002, when Applicant was employed as a \nsupervisor in a government contractor\u2019s asset management program. Her job required \nthat she maintain an inventory of all classified computers used by the contractor, and \nshe was responsible, as a supervisor, for certifying that any classified hard drives were \n\n \n3 \n \n \nremoved from computers before they were assigned to surplus or released to \nindividuals or groups outside of the organization. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.; Tr. 123-124.) \n \n \nIn May 2002, an employee sought to acquire computers that the contractor was \nno longer using for donation to a youth group. The employee\u2019s request generated a \nprocedure and the completion of a form certifying that the computers to be released had \nbeen stripped of their classified hard drives and contained no classified information.  (Tr. \n125-126.)  \n \n \nIt was Applicant\u2019s job to ensure that the process was carried out according to \nestablished rules and procedures for protecting classified information. The process \nrequired four signatures for release of the computers when an individual or group \nrequested them. First, Applicant took a form with the request to an official in her \ndepartment.  If the official approved the request, he signed the form. Applicant took the \nsigned form back to her work area.  As the supervisor of her work unit, she was \nresponsible for ensuring that all hard drives were removed from the computers to be \ntransferred. Two signatures from Applicant\u2019s work unit were required on the form.  \nApplicant had the authority to do the work herself or to assign two subordinates to \nremove the hard drives from the computers. Whoever did the work, signed the form. \nAfter Applicant and her subordinates completed their tasks, an individual from security \nphysically inspected all computers that were to be transferred to verify that they had \nbeen declassified and were cleared for transfer. If he found the computers were \nproperly declassified, he then signed the form.  (Tr. 126-127.) \n \n \nThe day the alleged security violation took place was a Friday afternoon in May \n2002. Applicant took the form to the office of the department official to obtain his \nconcurrence and signature. She assigned a subordinate to remove the hard drives from \nthe computers. Each computer had two hard drives. When the subordinate had \nremoved all of the hard drives, he signed the form to certify that the computers had \nbeen declassified. Without physically inspecting the computers to verify that the hard \ndrives had all been removed, Applicant signed the form to verify that the computers had \nbeen declassified. This was an error because, as the third signatory and the supervisor, \nshe was responsible for visually inspecting each of the computers to ensure that all hard \ndrives had been removed in the declassification process. The security official then came \nand visually inspected all of the computers with Applicant and signed and certified that \nthe computers were declassified and ready for transfer to the employee who had \nrequested them. (Ex. 2 at 3; Tr. 127-129.) \n \n \nThe employee took possession of the computers and took them to his home for \nthe weekend before transferring them to a youth group. The following Monday, the \nemployee came to see Applicant and presented her with a hard drive he said he had \nfound in one of the computers.  He said he had found a third hard drive mounted in an \nunusual place in one of the computers. The employee provided no documentary proof \nto corroborate his assertion that he had found the additional hard drive in one of the \ncomputers transferred to him by Applicant\u2019s office. Additionally, the employee advised \nApplicant not to report that he had found the hard drive and to keep it as a confidence \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbetween them. Applicant ignored his advice and informed her management of the \ndiscovery of the hard drive. (Tr. 129-130.) \n \n \nAs a consequence, the government contractor removed Applicant from the \ncontract and transferred her to another position within the company.  The employer \ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s action was not a security violation, and it was not reported \nas such. There was no compromise of classified information. However, the employer \nnoted that Applicant had not complied with rules and regulations for protecting classified \ninformation. (Tr. 131-132.) \n \n \nDOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s action violated DoD 5220.22-M, NISPOM, \nChapter 5, Section 1 (January 1995). The relevant provisions read as follows: \n \n5-100. General. Contractors shall be responsible for safeguarding \nclassified information in their custody or under their control. Individuals are \nresponsible for safeguarding classified information entrusted to them.  The \nextent of protection afforded classified information shall be sufficient to \nreasonably foreclose the possibility of its loss or compromise. \n \n5-103. Perimeter Controls. Contractors authorized to store classified \nmaterial shall establish and maintain a system to deter and detect \nunauthorized introduction or removal of classified material from their \nfacility. The objective is to discourage the introduction or removal of \nclassified material without proper authority. If the unauthorized introduction \nor removal of classified material can be reasonably foreclosed through \ntechnical means, which are encouraged, no further controls are  \nnecessary. \n \n(HE 1.) \n \n \nThe second Guideline K incident alleged by DOHA at SOR \u00b6 1.b. occurred when \nApplicant was working in a non-classified area. Her work station computer was \nunclassified. Her duties included formatting resumes, scanning documents for various \npurposes, and creating PowerPoint presentations. Employees from within the \norganization came to Applicant for assistance in scanning and formatting documents. \n(Tr. 132-134.) \n \n \nIn October 2004, an employee (customer) working in another part of the \ncompany brought some documents compiled by countries in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) and asked Applicant to scan them into one document for her \nsupervisor. The documents were not classified, and the customer did not represent \nthem as such.  One of the documents was stamped \u201cNATO restricted,\u201d which was not a \nclassification description but a distribution description. Applicant scanned the materials \nas requested, and, after doing so, provided the scanned document to a fellow employee \nto format as requested by the customer. The fellow employee worked on the documents \non her computer at home and noticed that one of the documents was stamped \u201cNATO \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrestricted\u201d and concluded that the document was classified. She suspected that a \nsecurity violation had occurred. She reported the incident to the facility security officer \n(FSO), who concluded that Applicant had negligently failed to properly secure a NATO \nclassified document and had negligently left the document unsecured on her desk \novernight, in violation of DoD 5220.22-M, NISPOM, Chapter 5, Sections 1 and 3 \n(January 1995). (Ex. 3, 8-14; Tr. 50-63, 134-138.) \n \n \nThe NISPOM provisions relied on by DOHA in support of this allegation specify \nprocedures for safeguarding and storing information defined as classified by the U.S. \ngovernment. (HE 1) \n \n \nThe customer who sought Applicant\u2019s assistance in scanning the documents \nappeared as a witness. She was familiar with the sections of the NISPOM that relate to \nNATO security. Her testimony contradicted the FSO\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had \nfailed to comply with NISPOM rules and regulations for protecting and storing NATO \nrestricted material.  (Tr. 55-57.)  \n \n \nSection 7 of the NISPOM defines security requirements for compliance \nprocedures established by the U.S. Security Authority for NATO (USSAN) for \nsafeguarding NATO information provided to U.S. industry. Section 10-702 of the \nNISPOM provides the following definition of NATO Restricted: \n \n \n10-702. NATO RESTRICTED.  NATO RESTRICTED does not correspond \nto an equivalent U.S. classification. NATO RESTRICTED does not require \na PCL [employee personnel clearance] for access. An FCL [facility \nclearance] is not required if the only information to which the company will \nhave access is NATO RESTRICTED. IS [Information Systems] handling \nonly NATO RESTRICTED information do not require certification or \naccreditation.  NATO RESTRICTED information may be included in U.S. \nunclassified documents. The U.S. document must be marked, \u201cTHIS \nDOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO RESTRICTED INFORMATION.\u201d NATO \nRESTRICTED material may be stored in locked filing cabinets, \nbookcases, desks, or other similar locked containers that will deter \nunauthorized access.  \n \n(HE 3.) \n \n \n \nThe third Guideline K incident alleged by DOHA at SOR \u00b6 1.c. occurred on April \n28, 2006. DOHA alleged that Applicant violated Sections 1 and 3 of Chapter 5 of the \nNISPOM (February 28, 2006) by negligently failing to properly secure a classified room \nwhich was consequently left unlocked overnight. The allegation is based on an incident \nreport, dated May 5, 2006, prepared by the FSO employed by Applicant\u2019s employer. \n(Ex. 3 at 15-16; Tr. 142-144.) \n \n \nIn her report, the FSO concluded Applicant was negligent in failing to properly \nsecure the classified room and provided the following information: \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOn Monday, 1 May [2006] at 1630, the FSO was doing her evening check \non the secured Room #25 that contains two classified computers and two \nGSA safes. The door to Room #25 was shut but left unlocked. The FSO \nchecked the room for any open containers or documents that may have \nbeen left out. The classified computers were found to be down graded \nproperly with the classified hard drives secured in the safes. The safes \nwere found to be securely locked and there were no documents left out in \nthe room.  An inventory of the documents was taken.  None were missing. \n \n[Applicant] was the last person to sign out on Room #25 on Friday, 28 \nApril 2006. Unfortunately, on that day the FSO and her back up were not \nin the office [to] do the evening check on the room.  On Monday evening, \nwhen the room was found shut but unlocked, the sign out sheet posted on \nthe door before entering Room #25 noted that no one used the room on \nMonday.  The FSO questioned all employees who had keys to the Room. \nThis action assured the FSO that the room had not been used on Monday, \n1 May 2006. \n \nIt is concluded that Room #25, the safe or any classified documents in the \nsafe, the classified hard drives or the desktop computers [sic] were not \ncompromised.  [Applicant] has been instructed to ensure the door is \nlocked and properly shut when she is leaving either during work hours or \nat the end of the day.  Furthermore, the FSO will train an alternate back up \nto the back up so that the door is checked every day. \n \n(Ex. 3, at 15-16.) \n \n \nApplicant provided for administrative notice a calendar for April and the first week \nof May 2006. The calendar reflected that April 28 fell on a Friday in 2006. She also \nprovided a copy of the employer\u2019s log sheet for secured Room #25 for the period of \nApril 24, 2006 to May 8, 2006. At the top of the log sheet is the following statement: \u201cI \ncertify that I have unlocked, locked, or checked Room #25 at the time and date \nindicated by my signature below.\u201d On the log sheet were spaces for an individual to sign \nif he or she opened the secured room, closed and locked the secured room, or checked \nthe secured room to ensure that it was properly locked. (Ex. A; HE 2.) \n \n \nThe log sheet reveals that Applicant certified by her signature that she opened \nand entered secured Room #25 at 8:55 am on April 28, and she closed and locked the \nsecured room at 10:55 am on April 28. No other employees signed the log sheet to \nindicate they had opened or locked secured Room #25 on Friday, April 28, 2006. The \nlog sheet shows that the room was not checked by the FSO or other facility security \nstaff on Friday, April 28. There are no entries for Saturday, April 29, 2006. (Ex.A.) \n \n \nThe log sheet shows that on Sunday, April 30, 2006, no employee opened or \nlocked the secured room #25.  On Sunday, the FSO checked secured room #25 and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nsigned her name at 12:00.1  The log sheet also shows that on Monday, May 1, 2006, no \nemployees opened or locked secured room #25. The log sheet shows that on Monday, \nMay 1, 2006, the FSO checked secured room #25 at \u201c18:30,\u201d and signed the log.  (Ex. \nA; HE 2; Tr. 144-148.) \n \n \nThe FSO\u2019s report makes no mention of her inspection of the room on Sunday,  \nApril 30, 2006, when she apparently found the secure room locked. No one had signed \nthe log indicating access or departure after Applicant left the room on Friday, April 28, \nand the FSO\u2019s inspection on Sunday, April 30. If the room was locked when it was \nchecked by the FSO on Sunday, her conclusion that Applicant failed to lock the door on \nFriday was not credible. (Ex. A; Tr. 147-148.) \n \n \nThe fourth Guideline K incident, alleged by DOHA at SOR \u00b6 1.d., occurred on \nSeptember 12, 2006, when a senior manager, who was not her direct supervisor, came \nto Applicant\u2019s desk, along with an employee who reported to the supervisor. Applicant\u2019s \ndesk was located in an unclassified area, and she had the only operating scanner in the \nbuilding. As a part of her regular duties, she routinely carried out requests by other \nemployees and managers who brought her documents to scan and format. The \nmanager presented Applicant with a document containing approximately five pages. \nThe pages on the document were folded back, revealing a top page containing an \nunclassified signature. The manager asked Applicant to scan the signature on the top \npage, put it on a compact disk (CD), and give the CD to a second employee, who would \ntake it to a classified room and put it in a safe.  (Tr. 70-73, 100-101, 157.) \n \n \nThe manager did not tell Applicant or the other employee that the five-page \ndocument contained classified information. There were no visible cover pages or \nconventional color coded markings normally used by the government contractor \nemployer to indicate that the document contained classified information. The manager \nexpected that the employee she supervised would return the document to a classified \nsafe after the signature had been scanned and formatted. (Tr. 76, 102-103.) \n \n \nApplicant scanned the signature, put it on a CD, and gave the CD to the second \nemployee. The second employee left Applicant\u2019s work area with the CD and took it to be \nstored in a classified safe. Applicant turned to other assigned work. The document, \nwhich she did not know contained classified information, remained on her desk. It was \nnot unusual for individuals who asked Applicant to scan and format documents to leave \nthem or to indicate that the documents did not need to be returned. Applicant did not \nlook further at the document, and it remained there when she left at the end of the work \nday.  (Ex. 3, at 17-18; Tr. 149-151, 153-154.) \n \n \nWhen she arrived at work the next day, Applicant saw the document on her desk, \nlooked closely at it, and discovered a page with the word \u201csecret\u201d stamped on it.  She \nimmediately took the document to the manager and told her what had transpired. The \n \n1The record does not indicate whether the room was checked at 12:00 am or 12:00 pm. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmanager returned the document to the classified safe.  Applicant was rebriefed on the \nhandling of classified information. (Ex. 3 at 18; Tr. 166-167.) \n \n \nDOHA alleged that Applicant negligently failed to properly secure a classified \ndocument and negligently left the document unsecured on her desk overnight, in \nviolation of Sections 1 and 3 of Chapter 5 of the NISPOM (February 28, 2006). DOHA \nalso alleged that Applicant\u2019s conduct in failing to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation raised security concerns under the Personal Conduct adjudicative guideline.  \n \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s co-workers and supervisors provided letters of character \nreference on her behalf. They praised her as diligent, conscientious, truthful, dedicated, \nand a hard worker. They identified her as productive, dedicated to the mission of her \noffice, and compliant with operating rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s performance \nevaluations from 2002 through 2007 reflected above average performance and initiative \nin learning new skills of value to the organization. (Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. C; Ex. D; Ex. E; Ex. \nF; Ex. G; Ex. H; Ex. I; Ex. J; Ex. K;  and Ex. L.)  \n \n \nFor the past two years, Applicant has taken steps to avoid situations that might \ngive rise to allegations of security violations in the future. She has created unofficial \nforms that she asks her customers to fill in when they ask her to carry out tasks. With \nthese forms, she clarifies at the beginning of an assignment whether the work assigned \nto her is classified or unclassified.  Additionally, she has created an unofficial log system \nfor keeping track of classified material she is responsible for. She has learned to be less \ntrusting and ask for clarification from higher levels of management when she is tasked \nwith responsibilities related to classified information. (Tr. 158-159; 179-181.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nAG \u00b633 describes the Guideline K security concern as follows: \u201cDeliberate or \nnegligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other \nsensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, \nreliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such information. . . .\u201d \n \n \nThe Government properly conceded that it had failed to prove by substantial \nevidence the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. After my independent analysis, I \nagree.  Accordingly, those allegations are concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant was cited for a security violation for allowing a classified \ndocument to remain on her desk, unprotected, overnight. The record testimony \nestablished that Applicant was asked by a program manager to scan and format an \nunclassified signature on an unclassified page of the document. The program manager \nfailed to inform Applicant that other parts of the document that she could not see were \nclassified, and the document was not overtly marked as classified according to the color \ncode for classified information used by the government contractor employer. Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \ndid not examine the document to see if it was classified, and on the information she had \nreceived, she had no reason to do so. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that the document remained on her desk overnight. It was not \nunusual for Applicant to retain unclassified documents that she had worked on during \nthe day. When she discovered the next morning that the document contained a \nclassified marking, she immediately notified the program manager and returned the \ndocument to the manager.  \n \n \nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s actions did not constitute deliberate or negligent \nfailure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive \ninformation.  Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant provided relevant and material facts \nto rebut the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.d.  SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d. is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nThe remaining SOR allegation, \u00b6 1.a., recounts that in 2002, Applicant signed \nrequired certifications that all hard drives had been removed from classified computers \nthat were to be released as surplus for private use by a youth group.  She did this \nwithout following required procedures that she, as the supervisor of the unit, physically \nexamine the computers and independently review the previous certification of a \nsubordinate. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nother sensitive information raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 34 (g), which reads: \n\u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive \ninformation.\u201d     \n \n \nTwo Guideline K mitigating conditions might be applicable to the facts alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.  AG \u00b6 35(a) reads: \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it \nhappened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 35(b) reads: \u201cThe individual responded favorably to counseling or \nremedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the \ndischarge of security responsibilities.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alleged security violation occurred in May 2002, and it is therefore not \nrecent. The incident happened under unusual circumstances, and Applicant correctly \nreported to her facility security officer that she received a discrepant hard drive from the \nindividual who took delivery of the declassified computers on behalf of a youth group. I \nconclude that, when viewed in light of Applicant\u2019s present reputation for care and \ndiligence, it is not likely that a similar incident will occur in the future, and this 2002 \nincident does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Her action did not result in the compromise of classified information. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 35(a) applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \n \nAfter her alleged security incidents, Applicant received remedial security training.  \nShe provided credible testimony about the attention she now gives to ensuring that she \nidentifies and protects classified information entrusted to her care.  I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n35(b) also applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nThe SOR concluded that Applicant\u2019s personal conduct related to her failure to \nproperly secure classified information, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c, and 1.d, \nraised doubts about her judgment, reliability, and ability to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Under the Personal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d  AG \u00b615. \n \n \n I have considered all of the Personal Conduct disqualifying conditions. Applicant \nwas entrusted with a security clearance, which her employer relied upon in employing \nher. She was responsible for following her employer\u2019s and the NISPOM\u2019s policies for \nprotecting classified information. I conclude that that the evidence in this case \nestablishes that Applicant rebutted or mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns \nunder Guideline K. I conclude that no additional disqualifying conditions apply to that \nconduct under the Personal Conduct adjudicative guideline.  Accordingly, the Guideline \nE allegation in the SOR is concluded for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. Several \nof the security incidents attributed to her were the result of miscommunication and \nmisinformation. She has learned from her mistakes, and she has put in place a method \nto ensure she receives sufficient information to protect the classified information she is \nentrusted with. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nI observed Applicant carefully at her security clearance hearing.  I found her to be \na serious and responsible person. I believe it is highly unlikely that in the future she will \nfail to carry out any of the responsibilities of a person entrusted with a security \nclearance and the protection of classified information. I conclude that she is not a \nsecurity risk at this time. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance, and I \nconclude Applicant rebutted and mitigated all security concerns arising under Guideline \nK and Guideline E. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n                    FOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d:          For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  2.a:  \n                    For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Stephan Math, Esquire\nSeptember 9, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 26, 2006.\nOn March 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J and G\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on April 8, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on May 15, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 13, 2008, and the\nhearing was scheduled to be heard on July 2, 2008. At the request of Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel, the case was continued, and  I convened the hearing on August 4, 2008. \nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 10, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant and two additional witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, and he\n\n2\nsubmitted Exhibit A, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on August 14, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.c., under\nGuideline J, and 2.b. and 2.c., under Guideline G. He denied allegation 2.a. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He is employed\nby a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal acts.\n1.a. On April 14, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Disorderly\nConduct. He pled guilty to the charge of Disorderly Conduct, and he was sentenced to\nserve two days in jail, which was suspended upon payment of a fine, one year of\nunsupervised probation, and he was fined $300.   \nApplicant testified that he was with a group of friends on a boat, and after they\nexited the boat, he had to use the restroom, but since there were no facilities\nimmediately available, he relieved himself behind some bushes, and out of sight. When\nhe emerged from the bushes he was arrested. Applicant testified that he had not\nconsumed any alcoholic beverages on the day prior to this incident, and that alcohol did\nnot influence his conduct. Also, no alcoholic restrictions were placed on his probation as\na result of this incident.\nApplicant submitted a declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, from one of\nthe individuals who was with him during this incident (Exhibit A). She verified that\nApplicant had not consumed any alcohol before the incident, and that since he was\nunable to locate facilities where he could relieve himself, he simply went behind some\nbushes to do so. \n1.b. On March 19, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1)\nMisdemeanor Battery and (2) Disturbing the Peace. Applicant plead Nolo Contendere to\nCount 2, and Count 1 was dismissed. He was placed on 12 months of summary\nprobation, fined $100, and sentenced to serve two days in jail; but he was given credit\nfor two days served. \n\n3\nApplicant testified that this incident occurred when he was with a group of friends\nat a restaurant, when he go into an altercation with another individual at the facility and\nApplicant struck the other individual in self-defense, as the other individual was trying to\nharm Applicant.  Applicant testified that he had only consumed one beer prior to this\nincident, and that alcohol did not influence his conduct in this altercation. No alcoholic\nrestrictions were placed on his probation as a result of this incident.\nApplicant submitted a declaration, signed under penalty of perjury, from one of\nthe individuals who was with him during this incident (Exhibit A). He verified that\nApplicant been involved in an altercation, but Applicant did not start it, and he had not\nconsumed any more than one beer before the incident occurred. Finally, this witness\nstated that for the past 10 years that he has known Applicant, he \u201cnever observed him\nto drink alcohol to excess,\u201d and he described \u201chis demeanor to normally be one of\ncalm.\u201d\n1.c. On December 2, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving\nUnder the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs (DUI), (2) Driving with a Blood Alcohol Content\nof 0.08% or Above.   Applicant plead Guilty to Count (2). He was placed on 36 months\nsummary probation, fined $390, and sentenced to serve three days in jail; but he was\ngiven credit for one day served. He also attended 12 weeks of Alcoholics Anonymous.\nApplicant testified that this incident occurred after he was at a bar and grill with\nfriends, during which he had consumed \u201ca few drinks that night.\u201d As he was driving\nhome, he was stopped by the police for speeding, during which he received a field\nsobriety test. \nApplicant stated that he had met all of the requirements of his probation, and that\nshortly after the hearing he would be attending his last court required class. His\nprobation is scheduled to end in February 2010. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as they\nare cited in the SOR, and to which, as stated above, Applicant admitted:\n2.a.   The Government alleges that Applicant consumed alcohol prior to the\narrests referenced in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b., above. As discussed above,\nApplicant testified credibly that he had consumed no alcohol before the first arrest, 1.a.,\nand he had only consumed one beer before the second arrest, 2.a. \n2.b.  The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s conduct that is set forth under\nsubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c., above, constitutes excessive alcohol consumption.\nOnly the conduct that resulted in the DUI arrest discussed in 1.c., above manifests\nexcessive alcohol consumption. \n2.c.  Applicant continues to consume alcohol despite the conduct that resulted in\nsubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c., above. \n\n4\nApplicant testified that he continues to consume alcohol, but only in moderation,\n\u201conce every couple of weeks or so.\u201d He also testified credibly that since the DUI, he has\nnot driven and will never drive again after consuming alcohol.  After his one DUI he is\nfar more aware and concerned about alcohol related conduct, specifically related to\ndriving a vehicle. \nMitigation\nTwo character witnesses, who have known Applicant professionally, testified on\nhis behalf. They were both quite laudatory, describing Applicant \u201cas very reliable\u201d with\n\u201cvery reasonable judgement,\u201d neither witness had ever seen the Applicant intoxicated or\nunder the influence of alcohol. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information)\nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct, as\nhe was arrested for, and convicted of a DUI criminal offense and two lesser offenses.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and (d), individual is currently on\nprobation, apply in this case. Under Mitigation Conditions, I find that MC 32. (d) applies\nto this Applicant, as there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the sincere remorse of Applicant, which I base on Applicant\u2019s testimony, and\nhis good employment record, which has been verified by the two additional witnesses at\nthe hearing.  Applicant has mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\n       Applicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in one DUI arrest and conviction,\noccurring in 2006.\nThe Government established that Applicant was involved in an alcohol-related\nincident away from work, and binge alcohol consumption to the point of impaired\njudgement on one occasion. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 22. (a) and (c) apply to this\ncase.  \nAs stated above, Applicant admitted to currently drinking, two times a week \u201conce\nevery couple of weeks or so,\u201d  but in moderation, and he never drives after drinking.  I\nfind that Mitigating Condition (MC) 23. (a) applies as the behavior was so infrequent,\nonly one DUI in his life, for which he is extremely sorry, that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability and trustworthiness. Paragraph\n2 is found for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\n\n6\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the factors\ndiscussed above, including the character letters and the testimony of both witnesses,\nplus Applicant\u2019s credible sincere remorse, I find that Applicant is a responsible person,\nwho will continue to control his alcohol consumption, so that in the future, he will not find\nhimself in the position of driving after he has consumed alcohol. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nFor  Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 21, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 8, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant asks that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision be reversed.  In support of that\nrequest, Applicant states that since the hearing he has transferred to a new job at another company\nand has received a substantial pay raise.  This new increase in pay has allowed him to re-enter the\nConsumer Credit Counseling Services Program, and to qualify for the California Child Support\nDivision\u2019s Compromise of Arrears Program.  He argues that participation in these programs will\nmitigate the security concerns raised by his financial problems.\nThe Board cannot consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nGiven the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s submission on appeal does not demonstrate\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security eligibility, there\nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See, e.g.,  ISCR\nCase No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision he still had significant outstanding debts\nand was still in the process of trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the\nJudge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent and still ongoing.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10312 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 15, 2008).  The Judge weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  She found in favor of\nApplicant under Guideline E and as to some of the SOR allegations under Guideline F.  However,\nshe reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the\n\n3\nrecord, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Payments towards the delinquent child support account alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c are garnished from Applicant\u2019s pay check. The garnishment is $86.54 per \npay period, $173 monthly. One half of Applicant\u2019s tax refund is applied to his delinquent \nchild support. The child support is owed to his two children from his first marriage. (Tr at \n28-35; Gov 2 at 43.) Applicant claims the cable bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o should have \nbeen transferred to his bill in El Paso. (Tr at 37-38.) No documentation was submitted \nverifying this. \n \nApplicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r. He states that he signed up for \na class with this university. Before taking the class, he was transferred to another state. \nHe claims that he should not be responsible for a class he did not take. He is attempting \nto resolve this account. (Tr at 25, 39-43; Gov 2 at 32; AE I.) \n \nNone of the other delinquent debts are resolved yet. Applicant has made no \narrangements to pay the other debts. (Tr at 37, 38-39.) He does not make enough \nincome to pay his delinquent accounts. He and his family live pay check to pay check. \n(Tr at 48; Answer to SOR.) He states that his financial difficulties are the result of two \ndivorces. His wife is unable to work because of their young children. She tried working \nbut child care was too expensive. (Tr at 44.) In 1996, he and his wife were working for a \nfaith-based children\u2019s home. They were not paid for a period of seven months. In 2001, \nhe was unemployed for approximately nine months. (Tr at 73.)  \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant attended consumer credit counseling. He was \nadvised that he had insufficient income to pay his debt and to file for bankruptcy. \nApplicant chose not to file for bankruptcy. (Tr at 46-47; AE J; Gov 2 at 35\u201342; Answer to \nSOR.) He is attending financial counseling through a biblical based counseling agency. \n(Tr at 46-47; Answer to SOR.)  He applied for a loan from his 401(k) account which has \na balance of approximately $2,700. The loan was denied due to policy reasons. (Tr at \n51; AE K.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $2,204. (AE H.) His total \nmonthly expenses are approximately $2,040, leaving him little additional income to \napply towards his delinquent debt . (AE 2 at 30.) \n \nBetween 1980 and 1989, Applicant served on active duty in the United States \nArmy. He rose to the rank of Sergeant (E-5). He was a drill sergeant in his last duty \nposition.  On May 13, 1988, he caught one of his female trainees smoking and drinking. \nHe threatened her with disciplinary action and subsequently had sexual intercourse with \nher. He threatened another female trainee with non-judicial punishment if she told \nanyone about his actions with the other female trainee. (Gov 5.)  \n \nAfter an investigation, court-martial charges were preferred.  On August 5, 1988, \nApplicant got into an argument with his wife. He assaulted her by punching her in the \nstomach and face with his fist, pulling her hair, and pushing her into a washing machine. \n(Gov 2 at 21-29.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nOn November 28, 1988, Applicant was tried by general court-martial for a \nviolation of Article 92, UCMJ, Dereliction of Duty; Article 134, UCMJ, Adultery, \nCommunicating a Threat and Solicitation to Commit Sodomy; and Article 128, UCMJ, \nAssault. He was acquitted of the Solicitation to Commit Sodomy charge and convicted \nof all other charges. He was sentenced to a Bad Conduct Discharge, 18 months \nconfinement and reduced to Private (E-1). (Gov 7.)  He served approximately ten \nmonths at a retraining facility. On October 5, 1989, he was released on parole. On May \n27, 1990, he successfully completed parole. (AE 2 at 46-52; Answer to SOR.)     \n \nOn August 29, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in relation to his security clearance.  He answered, \n\u201cyes\u2019 to Section 19, Your Military Record which asks \u201cHave you ever received other than \nan honorable discharge from the military?\u201d If the answer is affirmative, applicants are \nrequired to provide the date and type of discharge.  Applicant indicated that he was \ndischarged in October 1989 with a discharge characterized as \u201cOther Than Honorable.\u201d \n(Gov 1.) It is alleged that he deliberately falsified his response by not listing his Bad \nConduct Discharge.   \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant states that he did not intend hide his Bad \nConduct Discharge, He misunderstood the question and was not specific. He \nunderstood the question required him to state whether he had an honorable or other \nthan honorable discharge.  At hearing, he testified that he did not understand the \ndifference between a Bad Conduct Discharge and an other than honorable discharge. \nHe was not trying to mislead the government.(Tr at 60-62.)   \n \nOn the same eQIP application, dated August 29, 2006, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d \nin response to 23(a) Your Police Record, which asks \u201cHave you ever been charged with \nor convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under Uniform Code of Military \nJustice).\u201d (Gov 1.) It is alleged he deliberately failed to disclose that he was charged \nwith Communicating a Threat and Solicitation to Commit Sodomy. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant stated that he read the question too quickly and assumed it was asking \nabout civilian offenses rather than military offenses. At hearing, Applicant testified that \nhe was not aware that the communicating a threat was a felony. He was aware that  \nsolicitation to commit sodomy was a felony but he was acquitted of that charge. He did \nnot think that the offenses he was convicted of were felonies because he was sent to a \nretraining brigade as opposed to a prison. Since being released from parole, he has \nserved jury duty and is allowed to vote.  He did not really understand what a felony is \naside from it being very serious. He is aware that it is more serious than a \nmisdemeanor. (Tr at 67-72.)       \n \nApplicant\u2019s minister states that Applicant is involved in the coordination of a \nnumber of events and is a member of the Saturday Men\u2019s Bible Study. He states \nApplicant is a man of high integrity and character. Applicant is a man who loves God, \nhis family, and his church. (AE D at 1.) Another church pastor describes him as \ntrustworthy and dependable. (AE D at 2.)  His manager states that Applicant maintains \n\n \n5 \n \n \na level of commitment and dedication unsurpassed by others in the organization. \nApplicant\u2019s honesty, professionalism, and can do attitude has earned him the respect of \nsoldiers, co-workers, and management. He trusts him to the fullest. (AE C at 3.) Another \nmanager describes him as \u201corganized, efficient, and extremely competent.\u201d (AE C at 4.) \nAn assistant manager states that \u201cHe is a constant professional in his appearance, \npresentation, and attitude.\u201d (AE C at 5.)  Applicant has attended numerous training to \nenhance his job skills. (AE D.) \n \nIn addition to volunteering for his church, he volunteers with the Lion\u2019s Club and \ncoaches a women\u2019s softball team. (Tr at 77; Answer to SOR.) He does not dispute the \nhorrible mistake he made while serving in the US Army.  He regrets it to this day. He \nindicates that it has been 18 years since he has been in trouble with the law.  He has \nnothing to hide and hopes to be granted a security clearance in order to allow him to \ncontinue working. (Answer to SOR.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations. He is still paying delinquent child support for his two oldest children \nwho are now both adults. This is the debt with the largest balance in the amount of \n$48,784.  The SOR alleged 17 additional delinquent debts, with an approximate balance \nof $6,688.  Applicant\u2019s income is insufficient to pay his delinquent debts and meet his \ndaily living expenses.    \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. Aside \nfrom the child support debt, the majority of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent within \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe past five years.  Although Applicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, and \n1.h, and is paying his delinquent child support, most of the debts are unresolved. With \nhis wife not working, Applicant does not have the means to resolve the debt. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant\u2019s two divorces \nmore than likely caused a financial burden in the past. However, neither divorce is \nrecent. He has been married to the same woman for the past 18 years. Applicant \nsuffered several periods of unemployment. However, he has been steadily employed for \nthe past several years. It cannot be concluded that all of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nwere beyond his control.  For this reason, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given little weight.    \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Although Applicant attended two different financial counseling \nclasses. He has no plan in place to resolve his delinquent accounts. In fact, he is unable \nto pay his debts due to a lack of income. It is unlikely that his financial problems will be \nresolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, in part, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. 1.d.  \nand 1.g. However, 15 unresolved delinquent debts remain. Applicant is unable to pay \nthese debts based on his current income.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply.  Although Applicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r, he \nhas provided insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the dispute will be resolved in his \nfavor.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant listed that he received \nan other than honorable discharge in response to section 19 on his e-QIP application. \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies to this \nallegation. Applicant explained that he misunderstood the question and he did not know \nthe difference between an other than honorable discharge and a bad conduct \ndischarge. I find he had no intent to mislead the government about the characterization \nof his discharge. Applicant does not have legal training and more than likely did not \nunderstand the nuances dealing with discharge characterizations. The fact that he did \nnot list that he received an honorable discharge should have been sufficient notice for \nthe government to inquire about his military background. SOR \u00b6 2.c is found for \nApplicant.  \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) potentially applies to Applicant\u2019s negative reply to section 23(a) \non his e-QIP application, which asks whether he was ever charged or convicted of a \nfelony offense.  I find Applicant\u2019s explanations credible as to why he did not answer in \nthe affirmative. He has no legal training. The question does not provide the definition of \na felony. At hearing, Applicant was asked to describe what a felony meant. He admitted \nthat he did not know other than it was more serious than a misdemeanor. SOR \u00b6 2.d is \nfound for Applicant. \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b were all charged during the same court-\nmartial. While these allegations are more appropriately alleged under the criminal \nconduct guideline, one can conclude that Applicant\u2019s past conduct raises the general \nconcern under personal conduct. He was convicted of dereliction of duty, adultery, \ncommunicating a threat, and assault.  As a drill sergeant his conduct was reprehensible. \nHe violated the trust the U.S. Army placed in him to care for his subordinates as well as \nhis family. His conduct showed questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. On the other hand, it has been over \n18 years since Applicant completed the terms of his sentence and parole. Since that \ntime, he has maintained a clean criminal record.  PC MC \u00b6 17(c ) (the offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant is active \nin his community and has a favorable work record. While the offenses he was convicted \nof while in the military were serious, his present conduct does not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are found for \nApplicant.  \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork evaluations, his clean criminal record for over 20 years, and his efforts to resolve \nsome of the accounts. However, a majority of his delinquent accounts remain \nunresolved and are unlikely to be resolved in the near future. While the personal \nconduct concerns are mitigated by finding of a lack of intent to deceive and the passage \nof time, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance based on his financial situation. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., and 2.a. and 2.b., of the SOR. Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a SECRET security clearance. He has been employed as a modem hardware engineer by the same government contractor since April 2004.9 Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1958,10 and resided there with his parents. In January 1982, he came to the U.S. and enrolled in a graduate program at a U.S. university.11 He received his Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering in September 1989.12 In January 1990, after searching for employment, Applicant joined a subsidiary of a major U.S. corporation, as an electrical engineer.13 He remained there for over eight years, and subsequently left for other opportunities in the U.S. He eventually joined his current employer. In 1993, Applicant married a naturalized U.S. citizen,14 and he and his wife had two children, both of whom are native-born Americans.15 Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2004.16 8 Tr. at 18, 26-28. 9 Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated Jun. 1, 2005), at 2. 10 Id. at 1; Applicant Exhibit A (Taiwan Passport, issued Dec. 16, 2005), at 1.

Trent, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding foreign preference and \nforeign influence.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information \nis granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 1, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nEPSQ version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On November \n19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nJuly 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nOn December 29, 2005, the President promulgated revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information, and on \nAugust 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the SOR was issued \non or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his \nSOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 3, 2007. In a sworn, written statement, \ndated December 19, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on February 1, 2008, and the case was assigned \nto Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro on February 4, 2008. It was reassigned to me on \nFebruary 14, 2008, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of Hearing was issued on \nFebruary 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 20, 2008. \n \nDuring the hearing, three Government exhibits and two Applicant exhibits were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on March 28, 2008. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take \nAdministrative Notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to Taiwan, also referred to \nas the Republic of China (hereinafter Taiwan), appearing in a written submission of the \nrequest.  Facts are proper for Administrative Notice when they are easily verifiable by \nan authorized source and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the source \ninformation relied upon by the Government was publications of the Department of \nState;1 the Congressional Research Service;2 the Center for Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Studies;3 the National Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of \nthe National Counterintelligence Executive;4 a press release from the U.S. Department \n \n1 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Background Note: Taiwan, dated \nOctober 2007. \n \n2 Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy \nChoices, dated October 9, 2006. \n \n3 Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, Intelligence Threat \nHandbook, excerpts, dated June 2004. \n \n4 National Counterintelligence Center, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and \nIndustrial Espionage, dated 2000. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nof Justice, U.S. Attorney, Western District of New York;5 a press release from the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of Virginia;6 and records of the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.7 \n \nWith regard to the National Counterintelligence Center Report, I note that it is \neight years old, and the cited facts are based upon a \u201cprivate survey\u201d of \u201cnearly a dozen \nselected Fortune 500 companies.\u201d The report does not indicate how the companies \nwere selected, what companies were selected, or how they decided upon their input to \nthe survey. The survey results do not indicate whether the collection of economic \ninformation was accomplished through \u201copen\u201d methods, such as reading a newspaper, \nthat raise no security issues under the relevant criteria, or more covert methods that \nmight raise security concerns. Furthermore, as the selected companies are unidentified, \nit is impossible to assess possible bias or determine if there is an existing anti-Taiwan \neconomic or political agenda. For these reasons, I conclude the factual matters \nasserted by Department Counsel, as demonstrated by the proffered report, should be \ngiven less weight than information from a more authoritative source.  \n \nThe two press releases were presented apparently to substantiate that Taiwan \nactively pursues collection of U.S. economic and propriety information, and therefore, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with family members in Taiwan raises suspicion of him. Neither \ncase involves Applicant personally or involved espionage through any familial \nrelationship. The Western District of New York press release concerns the sentencing of \na U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade secret theft during 1999-2001 to the benefit \nof a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no indication of any government \nsponsorship, approval, or involvement encouraging the Taiwanese company\u2018s attempt \nto acquire sensitive commercial information for competitive advantage.  Likewise, there \nis no evidence that Taiwan\u2019s government was involved in, or sanctioned, the criminal \nactivity. \n \nThe Eastern District of Virginia press release and the court record set forth the \nfacts and sentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for unauthorized \npossession of classified information, making false statements to the government \nconcerning his relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer, and by not \nreporting that he had traveled to Taiwan where he met with the foreign intelligence \nofficer. The criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens is of decreased relevance to an \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s security suitability, especially where there is no evidence that \nApplicant, nor any member of his family, was ever involved in any aspect of the case or \never targeted by any Taiwanese intelligence official. \n \n \n5 U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney, Western District of New York, Press Release: Defendant \nSentenced to 48 months in Trade Secret Theft Case Re: United States v.

Pursuant to Rule 201, Federal Rules of \nEvidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below under the \nTaiwan subsection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.d., and 2.a. and 2.b., of the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nobtain a SECRET security clearance.  He has been employed as a modem hardware \nengineer by the same government contractor since April 2004.9  \n \nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1958,10 and resided there with his parents.  In \nJanuary 1982, he came to the U.S. and enrolled in a graduate program at a U.S. \nuniversity.11 He received his Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering in September \n1989.12 In January 1990, after searching for employment, Applicant joined a subsidiary \nof a major U.S. corporation, as an electrical engineer.13 He remained there for over \neight years, and subsequently left for other opportunities in the U.S. He eventually \njoined his current employer. In 1993, Applicant married a naturalized U.S. citizen,14 and \nhe and his wife had two children, both of whom are native-born Americans.15 Applicant \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2004.16  \n \n \n8 Tr. at 18, 26-28. \n \n9 Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated Jun. 1, 2005), at 2. \n \n10 Id. at 1; Applicant Exhibit A (Taiwan Passport, issued Dec. 16, 2005), at 1.

She became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in September 1990.25 Her parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, \nresiding in the U.S.26  \n \nApplicant has two brothers, both of whom were born and raised in Taiwan.27 \nThey are Taiwanese citizens and residents.28 They attended U.S. universities and \ngraduated as mechanical engineers about 15 years ago.29 Both brothers are employed \nby the same non-Taiwanese multinational corporation,30 and neither brother has had \nany affiliation or association with any Taiwanese governmental service or intelligence-\nrelated entity.31 Applicant has had very little communication with his brothers since his \nmother passed away.

He \nresided in one and rented the other and then left them to his three sons.34 Aside from \nthat joint inheritance, Applicant does not own any property in Taiwan and has no other \nfinancial interests there.35 Applicant is prepared to renounce any interest he may have \nin the inheritance because his future in the U.S. is much more important to him than two \nvery old structures in Taiwan.36 He owns the family residence in the U.S.37 \n \nApplicant was issued a Taiwan passport in April 2000.  It was to expire in April \n2006.38 He was issued his U.S. passport in July 2004. It expires in June 2014.39 In \nNovember 2005, during an interview with an investigator pertaining to his application for \na security clearance, Applicant stated his Taiwan passport was due to expire in about \nMay 2006, and it would not be renewed since he now had a U.S. passport.40  However, \ndue to circumstances described below, in December 2005, Applicant renewed his \nTaiwan passport.41 He attempted to surrender it to Taiwan authorities, but they insisted \nthere was no such process, so he destroyed it by cutting it, and submitted the entire \ndestroyed passport to me at the hearing.42  \n \nFrom the time he first arrived in the U.S. in January 1982, until September 2002, \na period of nearly 21 years, Applicant remained in the U.S. and did not return to \nTaiwan.43 In 2002, because of his father\u2019s deteriorating health, Applicant returned briefly \nto Taiwan as a Taiwan citizen, using his Taiwan passport.44  In December 2005, his \n \n32 Id. at 45, 56. \n \n33 Id. at 46. \n \n34 Id. at 53. \n \n35 Id. \n \n36 Id. at 53-54. \n \n37 Id. at 29. \n \n38 Government Exhibit 3 (Taiwan passport, issued Apr. 2000, attached to Answers to Interrogatories, dated \nSep. 20, 2007). \n \n39 Id.

Believing he needed a visa to enter Taiwan on his \nnew U.S. passport, a process that could have been lengthy,45 Applicant opted to take \nthe quickest route to Taiwan and that meant using his Taiwan passport rather than his \nU.S. passport.46 However, after being advised by Taiwanese authorities that his old \nTaiwan passport could not be used if it was expected to expire within six months, he \nreluctantly renewed it.47  He used the renewed Taiwan passport to travel to Taiwan.48  \nApplicant returned to Taiwan in December 2006 to attend his father\u2019s funeral.49  This \ntime he used his U.S. passport after learning that he didn\u2019t need a visa to enter \nTaiwan.50 \n \nApplicant inquired as to the process for renouncing his Taiwanese citizenship, \nbut was advised by Taiwan authorities that it was a lengthy process which required \nextensive documentation which had to be filed in Taiwan.51  He intends to do so.52 \n \nTaiwan \n \nIn 1949, a large number of Chinese refugees fled from the civil war in mainland \nChina and immigrated to the off-shore Island of Formosa.  The Communists in mainland \nChina established the PRC, and Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang on \nmainland China, established a provisional government and capital in Taipei, Taiwan.  \nThe PRC refuses to recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is only \n\u201cone China.\u201d  After recognizing Taiwan for nearly 30 years, on January 1, 1979, the U.S. \nformally recognized the government of the PRC as the sole legitimate government of \nChina.  The U.S. does not support independence for Taiwan and, under the Taiwan \nRelations Act, signed into law on April 10, 1979, is committed to a \u201cone-China policy.\u201d \nNevertheless, the U.S. has been also been committed to maintaining cultural, \ncommercial and other nonofficial relations with Taiwan, and continues to provide arms \nin support of Taiwan\u2019s security and regional stability. \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy with a strong economy, with significant \neconomic contacts with both the PRC and the U.S.  Taiwan\u2019s own national security \nremains under constant threat from the PRC since PRC has not renounced the use of \nforce against Taiwan, and this has led to Taiwan\u2019s large military establishment. \n \n45 Id. at 36-37. \n \n46 Answer to SOR, supra note 40, at 1; Id. at 38-39.  \n \n47 Id.

There is no evidence that Taiwan uses coercive measures to \ngain access to such information. While there have been a number of incidents involving \nindividuals, companies, and Taiwanese intelligence officers improperly acquiring or \nattempting to acquire U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary information, there is no \ndirect or indirect connection to, or involvement with, Applicant.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d53 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \n53 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9:       \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 10(a), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member\u201d is \npotentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), this includes but is not limited to:  \n\u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 10(d) \u201cany statement \nor action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States: for example, \ndeclaration of intent to renounce United States citizenship; renunciation of United States \ncitizenship\u201d may raise security concerns. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in \nApril 2004, Applicant retained the Taiwan passport that had been previously issued to \nhim. Not only did he retain it, but in December 2005, due to a combination of \ncircumstances, he renewed it and used it as well, even though he had previously stated \nto an investigator that he would not do so.  By his actions, he exercised the rights and \nprivilege of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and \n10(d) apply. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign preference.  Under AG \u00b6 11(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where the \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nbirth in a foreign country.\u201d  Similarly, AG \u00b6 11(b), may apply where \u201cthe individual has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  Also, AG \u00b6 11(e) may apply \nwhere \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d \n \nApplicant explained that his only motivation for using his Taiwan passport in \nDecember 2005 was not an indication of a preference for Taiwan over the United \nStates, but rather solely for his convenience in entering Taiwan quickly to visit with his \nsick father.  Such actions, since 2000, have security significance.  However, prior to \n2000, that was not the case. Applicant\u2019s actions would not have been considered \nforeign preference-driven, or of security significance, but rather in pursuit of personal \ninterest of the type identified in a memorandum by the Director, Security Plans and \nPrograms, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, to the Director, Defense \nInvestigative Service, in March 1983, wherein he stated:54 \n \n. . . If an individual retains his/her foreign citizenship as a result of \naffirmative action on his/her part, an investigation should be initiated to \ndetermine the reasons for his/her action.  If these reasons adversely \nimplicate his/her loyalty or trustworthiness, there may be basis to deny, \nsuspend, or revoke a personnel security clearance.  If, however, an \nindividual asserts his/her rights to foreign citizenship in pursuit of \npersonal interest (e.g., wills, trusts, estates, taxes, family, etc.) there \nare no grounds to deny, suspend, or revoke a personnel security \nclearance. \n \n \nThus, the issue is, distilled to its basic components: whether Applicant's actions \nin renewing, possessing, and using his Taiwan passport in December 2005, were \nmerely for personal convenience, or indicative of a preference for Taiwan over the \nUnited States. Considering Applicant\u2019s explanations, and his subsequent action in \ndestroying his Taiwan passport and surrendering all the pieces to me, I find \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), \n11(b), and 11(e) apply. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \n \n54 See Memorandum from Director, Security Plans and Programs, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, \nto Director, Defense Investigative Service, subject: \"Personnel security clearances for U.S. citizens actively \nmaintaining dual citizenship with another country, dated March 15, 1983, at 1. (emphasis supplied) \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.55 \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. Also, AG \u00b6 7(e) may apply if there is \u201ca \nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any \nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) \napply in this case.  However, the security significance of these identified conditions \nrequires further examination of Applicant\u2019s respective relationships with his family \nmembers who are Taiwanese citizen-residents to determine the degree of \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.@ Similarly, AG \u00b6 8(b) may \napply where the evidence shows Athere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.@ In addition, AG \u00b6 8(c) may apply where \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  And AG \u00b6 8(e) \nmay apply where \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \n \n55 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his two brothers, his travel to Taiwan, and his \ninheritance of property in Taiwan are current concerns for the Government. Both of \nApplicant\u2019s parents are now deceased. He had little contact with either brother from the \ntime he arrived in the U.S. in 1982 until their mother passed away in 1991.  Thereafter, \nhe had no contact with his older brother and very infrequent contact with his younger \nbrother until their father died in December 2007. In the few months since that time, he \nhas had monthly contact with them. \n \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant \nfactors, including the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the \nrealistic potential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the \nforeign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the \ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is \nlimited to countries that are hostile to the United States.56  In fact, the Appeal Board has \ncautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations \nand \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d57 \n \nNevertheless, the relationship between a foreign government and the U.S. may \nbe relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely \nto attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to take action against the U.S. through the \nApplicant.  It is reasonable to presume that a friendly relationship, or the existence of a \ndemocratic government, is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign \ngovernment would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in \nthat foreign country. \n \nAs noted above, the U.S. and Taiwan have a history of friendly relations making \nit less likely that the Taiwanese Government would attempt coercive means to obtain \nsensitive information.  However, it does not eliminate the possibility that a foreign power \nwould employ some non-coercive measures in an attempt to exploit his relatives.  While \nApplicant has two brothers still residing in Taiwan, there may be speculation as to \n\u201csome risk,\u201d but that speculation, in the abstract, does not, without more, establish \nsufficient evidence of a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security \nclearance. \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his two brothers, there is a very low potential of \nforcing him to choose between the interests of U.S. and those of either Taiwan or his \nbrothers. He has met his burden of showing there is little likelihood that those \n \n56 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. \n10, 2002). \n57 ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nrelationships could create a risk for foreign influence of exploitation. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) \nand 8(c) partially apply in this case.  \n \nApplicant has been a resident of the U.S. since 1982.  He and his wife became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens and their two children are native-born U.S. citizens. He \nsurrendered his Taiwanese passport and he is willing to renounce his dual citizenship. \nThey have no foreign financial interests other than the small inheritance from his father, \ndescribed as two very old structures, which he is willing to renounce. He is fully involved \nin his children\u2019s lives and activities. Applicant and his wife have \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [they] can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \nIt is true that, since 1982, Applicant took three trips back to Taiwan to visit his \nfather who was in deteriorating health.  At the time of his first visit, in 2002, about 20 \nyears after he had been in the U.S., he was still a Taiwanese citizen. And that trip \nshould have no current security interest. However, when his father\u2019s condition worsened \nin 2005, and he eventually died in 2006, Applicant did so as a U.S. citizen.  I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n8(b) and 8(e) apply to his travel to Taiwan, his relationship with his brothers, and his \nforeign financial interests. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s parents are deceased. \nApplicant has resided in the U.S. since 1982, and became a U.S. citizen in 2004.  He \nmarried in the U.S., and his closest family members are his wife and two children-all \nU.S. citizens-and they reside with him in the U.S.  As such, they are not vulnerable to \ndirect coercion or exploitation, and the realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress with regard to them is low. \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his two brothers are not close and his contact with \nthem is sporadic. He had no relationship whatsoever with one brother from 1982 until \nDecember 2007, and has spoken to him only since their father passed away in \nDecember 2007. His relationship with his other brother was only slightly closer by virtue \nof having spoken to him infrequently when their father was not at home.  They have \nspoken several times since their father\u2019s death. While Taiwan is believed to be an active \ncollector of U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary information, there is no evidence \nthat Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain access to such information. It is in \nTaiwan\u2019s interests to maintain friendship with the U.S. to counterbalance the PRC. It is \nvery unlikely Taiwan would forcefully attempt to coerce Applicant through his two \nbrothers still residing in Taiwan. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) The presence of those family \nmembers in Taiwan without any affiliation or relationship to the Government of Taiwan, \ndoes not generate a realistic potential for exploitation. \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s actions in renewing and using his Taiwan passport on one \noccasion after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and after telling an investigator that \nhe had no intention of ever renewing that passport, they raise several different issues.  \nApplicant renewed the Taiwan passport only because he was under the erroneous \nimpression he needed to obtain a visa to see his ailing father and was advised by the \nTaiwanese authorities that a passport renewal was required.  He now knows better and \nhas destroyed the Taiwan passport.  (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), 2(a)(5), \n2(a)(7), and 2(a)(9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence \nand foreign preference concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n__________\nDecision\n__________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guidelines J, and E.\nClearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn September 14, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires For\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF\n86). On March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended,\nmodified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J, and E. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative\nOctober 31, 2008\n\n2\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on May\n13, 2008, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. Documents were attached to the answer with explanatory information. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated June 5, 2008, was\nprovided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided no additional\nmaterial. The case was assigned to me on October 21, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the  allegations in his answer to the SOR, and offered\nexplanations. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make\nthe following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 36 years old. He has been an employee of a defense contractor\nsince 2004 working as a warehouse specialist. He has a record over a dozen years of\ncriminal activity which is alleged under Guideline J as criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-e.).\nThese activities began in 1992 when he was 20 years old when he was arrested and\ncharged with felony burglary and sentenced to summary probation for 3 years and 70\ndays in county jail. His second offense was less than a year later in 1993 when he was\narrested and charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession of less than an ounce\nand fined. \nIn April 1996 he was cited for having an open container of alcohol in an\nautomobile, found guilty and fined. Less than a year later in 1997 he was arrested and\ncharged with transporting narcotics. The charges were dismissed because the drugs\nwere in the possession of a passenger. His last arrest was in December, 2003 when he\nwas charged with possession of less than one ounce of marijuana in a vehicle. He plead\nguilty and was sentenced to three years of summary probation and paid fines and fees\ntotaling $365. \nApplicant has attempted to change his conduct since his last drug arrest. He\nstates that he is not a habitual drug user, has a stable family environment, and that he\nhas matured in the past five years through a steady job. He offered no specific evidence\nto support these assertions but appears not to have had any further conduct problems. \nApplicant was also alleged to have violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by failing to answer\ncorrectly on his SF 86 Question 23 relating to his police record and Question 24 relating\nto drug activity (SOR \u00b6 1.f.). These allegations are also repeated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2. a.- d.\nunder Guideline E as personal conduct.  In his answer (Exh. 3) he stated that the\nreason for doing so was confusion about the question. However, he acknowledge in his\ninterrogatory answers and supplemental answers that he withheld the information\n\n3\ndeliberately to protect his employment, but now recognizes that doing so was not proper\nbehavior (Exhs. 6 and 8).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered For access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d\ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant]\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n4\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3.\nAnalysis\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude that the following Adudicative Guidelines provide the standard for\nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \nGuideline J Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31(c) provides that \u201can allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted\u201d is a disqualifying condition. Applicant was arrested for four offenses and cited\nfor a fifth between 1992 and 2003.  He was found guilty of four offenses and one of\nthem was dismissed. Thus, the evidence submitted clearly raises the potentially\ndisqualifying conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provide two conditions that could be applicable to mitigate the alleged\nsecurity concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nAlthough almost five years has elapsed since the last offense, they all related to\ncriminal activity some of which concerned drugs. His probation for the last offense\nexpired less than two years ago. Applicant has provided insufficient evidence of\nrehabilitation and it is premature at this time to apply the mitigating conditions.\n\n5\nThe allegation concerning 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1101 requires that the omission be\ndeliberate. Applicant admitted in his interrogatory answers (Exh. 6), and his\nsupplemental answers (Exh. 8), that his omissions were because he did not want to\nendanger his employment. Thus, I conclude that the omissions were deliberate. \nGuideline E Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline For Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and,\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant is alleged to have falsified material facts in response to Questions 23\nand 24 on his application for a security clearance. This prompted security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (b).\nAG \u00b6 17(c) provides that Applicant could mitigate security concerns from the\nfacts in this case. It is that if the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.\u201d\nMany of the offenses alleged occurred between ten and fifteen years ago and\ncould be  mitigated on this basis. Applicant falsified his answers to the security\nclearance questionnaire approximately three years ago. The last offense resulted in a\nsecond drug conviction that occurred less than five years ago. Also, the probation\nimposed for that conviction did not cease until less than two years ago. Thus, I conclude\n\n6\nthat it would be inappropriate, under these circumstances, to mitigate any of these\nallegations. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to criminal and personal conduct allegations.  He has made\nsome progress in changing his conduct through family responsibilities and stable\nemployment. However, the most recent conduct alleged cannot be attributed to youthful\nindiscretions for it occurred when he was 31 years old. The fact that he acknowledges\ndeliberately failing to answer the two critical question on his SF 86 also militates against\na favorable finding under the whole person doctrine. \nApplicant should not be permanently disabled from obtaining a security clearance\nsince most of the offenses are now quite old and he will have learned a valuable lesson\nwhich he now knows he needs to be totally candid in his responses to questions and\ninterrogatories. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting\nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and\ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or\novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible\nfor access to classified information.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or For Applicant on the allegations set Forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.: Against Applicant \n Conclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has no prior military service, and has never held a security clearance.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant admitted owing 12 delinquent debts, totaling $7,044, and denied,\nwithout substantiating evidence, an additional 7 delinquent debts totaling $4,402 that\nappear on her credit bureau reports (CBRs). She does not have the means to repay\nthese debts. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted her electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(SF 86), on December 29, 2005. On October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n1\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\nApril 25, 2008\n\nItem 2.\n2\nThe government submitted nine items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 5.\n4\nResponse to FORM, dated Mar. 18, 2008, at 1-2.\n5\n2\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 17, 2007, and requested\nthat her case be decided by an Administrative Judge on the written record without a\nhearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on February\n2\n12, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to\n3\nApplicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging\nreceipt of her copy of the FORM on February 29, 2008, and returned it to DOHA. She\nprovided a written response to the FORM on March 18, 2008, further explaining her\nsituation, and made no objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by\nDepartment Counsel, who did not object to consideration of Applicant\u2019s response to the\nFORM. I received the case assignment on March 27, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has no prior\nmilitary service, and has never held a security clearance. She never married, and has\ntwo children, ages eight and five. She was fired from a job she had held for three and a\nhalf years in October 2003, and was unemployed until March 2004 when she started\nworking on the military base where she is still employed.4\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 5, 2007, Applicant admitted the truth\nof the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h, 1.k through 1.n, and 1.q through\n1.s. These twelve delinquent debts total $7,044. Eight of these debts, totaling $1,535,\nare for medical bills placed for collection between January 2005 and September 2006.\nHer admissions are corroborated by the CBRs in Items 5 through 8 of the FORM, and\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. She also stated, \u201cI do understand that it has\ntaken me longer than average to get these accounts paid, however I have not been in a\nposition to be able to afford the arrangements that have previously been offered to me. I\nam actively contacting the creditors and will come to an arrangement with them that will\nsatisfy the debit [sic] and I will be able to afford.\u201d5\nThe seven delinquent debts listed in the SOR, which Applicant denied, total\n$4,402. Each of them is also documented on the record CBRs, although a few of the\nolder debts have been removed from more recent reports. The only explanation she\nprovided for denying any of these debts was a notation that she \u201ccleared\u201d a $3.00\ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.j) on December 7, 2007, about ten days before she\n\nItem 4 at \u00a7\u00a7 11, 22.\n6\n3\nsubmitted her SOR Answer, and well after the date alleged in the SOR. She provided a\nreference number, but no further evidence documenting payment of this debt. She\nsubmitted no evidence any of the remaining delinquent debts were either erroneously\nlisted on her CBRs or had been resolved. The record establishes that all SOR\nallegations are accurate. Some became delinquent as long ago as 1999, some as\nrecently as 2006, and some in the intervening years including many in 2005. In October\n2003, about eight months after her second child was born, Applicant was fired for\nmissing too much work, and was unemployed for the next five months.  However, her\n6\ndelinquencies both pre- and post-date this period of unemployment, and she did not\nspecifically attribute any of them to this time. Other than stating, without substantiation,\nthat she incurred significant medical expenses for her first child shortly after he was\nborn in 1999, she offered no other evidence that would support application of any\nfinancial considerations mitigating condition, either in terms of resolving or disputing\nthese debts, or by seeking counseling or other assistance.\nApplicant provided no other evidence of good character, trustworthiness or\njudgment for consideration in mitigation. Since she elected a determination on the\nwritten record, no in-person evaluation of her character or credibility was possible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant number and amount of\ndelinquent debts over the past nine years. She was either unable or unwilling to repay\nthese debts, and provided no information that repayment of any of them is probable in\nthe foreseeable future. Applicant demonstrated no effort to resolve her more than\n$11,400 of proven delinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination and balancing of resulting\nsecurity concerns with any potentially mitigating matters.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\n\n5\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nissues have been a continuing problem since at least 1999. She is a single mother of\ntwo children and has regularly incurred debt she could not repay throughout their lives.\nHer disregard of these financial obligations is ongoing, and continues to raise concerns\nabout her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence does not\nsupport this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquencies arose on a regular basis, with new delinquent debt reported in almost\nevery year since 1999. These delinquencies preceded and followed her five-month\nperiod of unemployment after being fired for missing work, with no evidence of recent\nresponsible action to address them. Some of the older debts may have become\ndelinquent due to medical expenses for her son\u2019s treatment, but the majority of her\nindebtedness arose more recently. This potentially mitigating condition is raised by her\nundocumented assertions, but is not supported as a factor for significant consideration\nin this case. \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant neither asserted nor provided evidence of either of\nthese conditions. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nApplicant expressed a desire to address or resolve the delinquent debts\nestablished by the Government, if and when she somehow acquires additional funds.\nTo date, however, she has made minimal, if any, effort to do so, even after receiving\nnotice of the security concerns raised by these issues. This supports the inference that\nshe remains financially overextended and, therefore, at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. The $3.00 delinquent debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j,  would\nbe insignificant standing alone, but it reflects part of a general pattern of inattention and\nfinancial irresponsibility. This pattern further indicates a lack of judgment and\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, thereby raising substantial questions\nabout her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for her choices and conduct. Some of her delinquent debts involve\nmedical bills, but they were relatively small, and appear to be co-pay or deductible\namounts. She did not show that any of these debts arose from unusual medical\ncircumstances, rather than normal care, or that the other debts arose due to\ncircumstances largely beyond her control. Applicant has been employed for all but five\nmonths of the period during which these debts became delinquent, but has resolved\nnone of them. She submitted no evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral\nchange, or demonstrating that risk of coercion or duress is not significant. Her ongoing\ndisregard of lawful obligations, especially after receiving notice of the security concerns\nraised thereby, creates continuing doubt about her trustworthiness and reliability. She\noffered no other evidence about her character or responsibility to mitigate these\nconcerns, or tending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 30, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on January 17, 2008, and reassigned to me on February 4, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 28, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nscheduled on February 20, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibit (AE) A, without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the \nrecord open until March 3, 2008, to submit additional matters.  Applicant submitted eight \npages of documents marked as AE B though F, and received without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The record closed on \nMarch 3, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 28, 2008.   \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 30, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, and 1.r of the SOR, with explanations. He \ndenied the remaining allegations. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school \ngraduate and attended technical school. He served in the U.S. military from 1989 to \n1996, and was honorably discharged. His marriage from 1989 to 1992 ended in divorce. \nHe remarried in 1994. He and his wife have two children, ages thirteen and four. He has \na 17-year-old child from a previous marriage and a 19-year-old stepchild.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has owned a business since before they married. After they \nmarried, Applicant became an owner and worked for the business. They were not paid \nsalaries; their income was dependent upon the profits from the business. In the summer \nof 2005, his wife was in a car accident and severely injured her right arm. She was out \nof work for two months following the accident. The company then lost two large \ncontracts and lost 95% of its income. They were not able to pay their debts and many \nbecame delinquent. Applicant obtained a job outside the family business in the spring of \n2006, and obtained his current job in about September 2006. His wife still owns and \nruns the business, but the business has not recovered and her income is low. She has \ntaken a part-time job as a waitress to supplement their income.2  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.r allege ten delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $44,854. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, totaling approximately $19,363, reflect the \namounts owed after two cars were repossessed. SOR \u00b6 1.g for $14,416 is from a \nsecond mortgage taken out to install a swimming pool. Applicant admitted owing all the \nabove debts and none of the ten debts have been paid. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 20, 37, 40-41; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 16-17, 27-28; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwas approximately $10,975 past due on his mortgage and it was proceeding to \nforeclosure. Applicant has reaffirmed the mortgage to the mortgagor\u2019s satisfaction and \nestablished a new payment schedule.3  \n \n \nThe debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.q reflect a series of state tax liens. \nThe debts were for sales tax owed from the company\u2019s sales of inventory. The sales tax \nwas collected from the company\u2019s customers but not fully paid to the state. Applicant \nadmitted owing the state tax lien of $8,534 filed in December 2005, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.k, but he stated that the underlying tax debt was paid. Applicant submitted a copy of a \npaid check of $8,045 to the state. The check was dated December 28, 2004, and \ncleared the bank on January 13, 2005. The state verified that the payment had been \nreceived and that it was not posted due to an error in their system. Applicant denied \nowing the other sales tax allegations, stating the liens were \u201creleased due to incorrect \ncalculations in amount.\u201d He testified that he and his wife were waiting for documentation \nfrom the state but that he believed the amount they owed was approximately $2,500. \nCourt records show state tax liens of $8,534 entered on December 15, 2005; $2,055 \nentered on August 14, 2006; $11,938 entered on March 23, 2007; $1,346, $1,297 and \n$9,677 entered on April 3, 2007; and $4,548 entered on May 23, 2007. The court \nrecords do not reveal the tax periods the liens represent. Applicant submitted evidence \nthat the $8,534 and the $9,677 liens were released. Letters from the state dated \nFebruary 27, 2008, revealed a total of $3,092 owed for the period of April 2004 to May \n2006, and $2,447 owed for the period of August 2006 to November 2006, for a total \namount owed to the state of $5,539.4 \n \n \nThe debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g all state that the debts have \nbeen \u201ccharged off.\u201d Applicant was told that means \u201cthat it\u2019s like they\u2019ve written them off \nand closed the accounts,\u201d and that they are no longer owed. He stated they intend to \nstart paying off the state taxes and the other debts that were not charged off.5 \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling in the late 1990s to address medical and \ncredit card bills, but has not received any counseling since that time.6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 21-23, 30; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR. \n \n4 Tr. at 18, 23-27; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2; AE A, C-F. \n \n5 Tr. at 18-19, 22. \n \n6 Tr. at 37-38. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. The debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.q reflect a series \nof state tax liens for unpaid sales tax. The records of the liens do not reveal what tax \nperiods the liens represent. The tax liens reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.q for $8,534 and \n$9,677 were released. Applicant owes $5,539 to his state for sales tax. None of the tax \nliens are for the exact amount still owed.  I am attributing the unpaid balance to the lien \nthat is closest in amount to, but less than, the figure still owed; that is the lien in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n for $4,548. The allegations of the other tax liens, as reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through \n1.m, and 1.o through 1.q, are concluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties resulted from his wife\u2019s car accident in the \nsummer of 2005, and the subsequent loss of business for their company. These are \nconditions that were largely beyond his control. Personal debts became delinquent and \nmoney collected for sales tax was not paid to the state. Applicant obtained his current \njob in about September 2006. Several of the personal debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, \n1.i, 1.j, and 1.r were charged off by the creditors, but none have been paid. The \nevidence does not support an affirmative finding that Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. He received counseling in the late \n1990s for other financial problems, but has not received counseling for his current \nfinancial problems. There are not clear indications that his financial problems are being \nresolved or are under control. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. No other \nmitigating condition is fully applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nrelated to his wife\u2019s car accident and the loss of business for their company. Personal \ndebts became delinquent and they failed to pay the state all the sales tax they collected \nfrom their customers. The personal debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.r \nhave not been paid since Applicant started working for his current employer in 2006, \nand more than $5,500 is still owed to the state. Applicant appeared sincere at his \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhearing and I also gave weight to his honorable military service. However, he has not \nsubmitted sufficient evidence to prove that he has control of his finances.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.q: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

As of the date of the hearing, she had 9 accounts, owing \napproximately $66,000, seven of which had been delinquent for many years. Her \nevidence is insufficient to show that she is in control of her finances, is not \noverextended, and has a track record of financial responsibility. She failed to mitigate \nsecurity concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 4, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Standard Form (SF) 86.1 On November 9, 2007, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \nAugust 14, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \n(SOR) to her,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The \nSOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 1, 2007 and January 21, 2008, and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 14, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 26, 2008. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled on March 26, 2008. The government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 19). \nApplicant testified on her own behalf, and presented four exhibits, marked Applicant \nExhibits (AE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 4, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nThe Government moved to amend the first sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.h, by deleting \nthe year \u201c2008,\u201d and substituting \u201c2007.\u201d Applicant did not object. I granted the motion \n(Tr. 13).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \n1.i, which she disputed, and SOR \u00b6 1.k, which is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.b. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.k allege the same offense and were consolidated under SOR \u00b6 1.b. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior software consultant working for a Government \ncontractor. After completing high school, she enlisted in the U.S. Army where she \nserved on active duty for three years. She achieved the rank of E-4, and received an \nhonorable discharge. While in the Army, she had access to classified information at the \ntop secret level. Since her discharge from the Army, she has had continuous access to \n \n2  GE 1 is the source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n3  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nclassified information. As of the hearing day, she had access to classified information at \nthe secret level. There is no evidence to show that she has ever compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information. Nor is there evidence showing that \nshe has ever failed to follow the rules and procedures required to handle classified \ninformation. She has no police record, and there is no evidence she has used or \ntrafficked in illegal drugs. \n \nAfter her discharge from the service, Applicant worked for a Government agency \nfor approximately 17 years as an analyst in the Information Technology field. In January \n2005, she resigned her civil service position and started working for defense \ncontractors. She has worked for her current employer since April 2006, and needs \naccess to classified information to do her job. Applicant is considered a valuable \nemployee, and had earned a good reputation among her customers and employer. She \nis considered a diligent and professional employee (AE 1).  \n \nApplicant has been married twice and has three children. She was first married in \n1981, and divorced in 1990. She has two daughters from that marriage, ages 24 and \n22. Applicant provides financial support to both of her daughters. Applicant\u2019s oldest \ndaughter is attending college. Applicant pays for her daughter\u2019s student loans and helps \nher with college expenses (Tr. 31, 67). Applicant\u2019s younger daughter is not married. She \nhas two children of her own, ages three and one. They live with and depend on \nApplicant\u2019s financial support on a frequent basis. Applicant married her second husband \nin 1990 and divorced him in 2003. She has a 17-year-old son from this marriage. He is \nattending high school and is fully dependent on Applicant. She receives $360 month as \nchild support from her second husband. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s 77-year-old mother \nlives with and is financially dependent on Applicant (Tr. 32).  \n \nApplicant has completed approximately 24 college hours of accounting and six \nhour of mathematics. She last attended college in 1999 (Tr. 5). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her e-QIP, two credit bureau reports (CBRs) from 2007 (GEs 2 & \n3), and a Docket Sheet for Applicant\u2019s 1999 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition (GE 4). The \nSOR alleges 11 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $68,600.  \n \nApplicant admitted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($1,118), 1.b ($6,827), \n1.c ($446), 1.d ($1,236), 1.e ($221), and 1.g ($36,049) are her debts and have been \ndelinquent for a long period of time. She disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($60), \nclaiming she never had an account with this provider, and 1.i ($2,135), claiming the debt \nshould have been paid by the seller of her house in accordance with her house \npurchase contract. She never contacted anyone to dispute SOR \u00b6 1.f (Tr. 34), and \nclaimed she did not know how to formally dispute the debts (Tr. 36). She presented no \ndocumentary evidence to support her claim concerning SOR \u00b6 1.f.  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nRegarding her 1999 bankruptcy filing, Applicant explained her financial problems \nwere caused by a combination of factors. After divorcing her first husband in 1990, she \nretained many of the debts she personally acquired while married. In addition to \nsupporting herself and her children, her parents moved in to live with her after her father \nwas diagnosed with cancer. She assisted her parents financially. She remarried in \n1990, and her second husband also had numerous debts from his first marriage. He \ncontributed very little to the household finances. The accumulation of her father\u2019s \nmedical expenses, her debts, and her then husband\u2019s debt, forced Applicant, her \nhusband, and her parents to file for bankruptcy protection. Most of her debts were \ndischarged in July 1999.  \n \nApplicant described her financial situation from 1999 to 2003 as \u201cpretty good but \nnot perfect\u201d. She was making it on a month-to-month basis, but not necessarily making \nall her payments, and sometimes she had to \u201cshuffle\u201d her payments (Tr. 41-42). In \n2003, Applicant made the mistake of buying a home outside of her financial means. \nAfter the purchase of her home, she struggled every month to pay the mortgage and to \ncover her day-to-day living expenses, and was never able to make ends meet (Tr. 37). \nApplicant could not make her mortgage payments and the house went into foreclosure \nin September 2007 (Tr. 37). Applicant believes she will owe approximately $56,000 as a \nresult of the foreclosure, which includes $36,000 she owed for a second mortgage on \nthe house (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \nApplicant left her Government employment in 2004 after 17 years of civil service. \nShe cashed in her civil service retirement fund because she needed money to pay off \nsome of her debts and a car note to have money left over at the end of the month to \nmake her mortgage payments (Tr. 61). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and her \nstate assessed taxes and penalties against Applicant for the early withdrawal of her civil \nservice retirement fund. This resulted in Applicant acquiring the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.l and 1.m. In September 2006, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the \nIRS to pay $280 a month. The IRS total initial debt was around $13,000. As of the \nhearing she owed approximately $7,344 (TR. 33-34, 65). In February 2008, she also \nestablished a payment plan with her State tax authorities to repay $5,600 in monthly \ninstallments of $400. \n \nAdditionally, while working for the Government and after leaving her civil service \njob, Applicant incurred travel and moving expenses associated with her job moves, \nlateral transfers, and servicing customers in different locations. As an example, she \nnoted that in January 2005, she moved back to her home state and took a pay cut of \n$35,000 (Tr. 59).  \n \nApplicant explained that although her delinquent debts are relatively small \n(except for the foreclosure related debts), she never made any effort to contact her \ncreditors and did not pay any of her debts because she could not afford to pay for her \nday-to-day living expenses and her past financial obligations (Tr. 71).  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \nApplicant testified she has not had any periods of unemployment since 1982. \nFrom 2004 to 2006, Applicant\u2019s yearly salary was approximately $75,000. Since 2006, \nshe has been earning approximately $110, 000 (Tr. 65). Her monthly take home pay is \naround $5,800. She receives $360 for child support. Her monthly rent is $1,090. Her \nmonthly expenses are as follow: utilities $500; food $500-$750, car insurance $350, car \npayment $450, and cell phone $200. Her son drives a 1999 Sebring she bought used in \n2002. In 2007, Applicant bought a 2006 Sebring because she needed a reliable car to \nperform her job as a traveling consultant (Tr. 45-46). She only carries a company credit \ncard which she uses for job related expenses.  \n \nIn January and August 2007, and in January 2008, Applicant consulted with a \nbankruptcy attorney seeking assistance to resolve her debt. She was advised to wait \nuntil her house foreclosure is final to determine the extent of her total debt before \ndeciding whether bankruptcy is a feasible option (Tr. 51, 75). Other than the bankruptcy \ncounseling she received in 1999, 2007, and 2008, Applicant has not participated in any \nfinancial counseling. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for her past financial problems. She asserted she is \ndoing the best she can under her circumstances. She noted her honorable service for \nher country, as well as her 17 years of civil service working for a Government agency. \nShe has had access to classified information since 1982 without any adverse incidents. \nThrough the years, Applicant has disclosed to her supervisors her financial problems \nand claimed her financial problems cannot be used by anyone to exploit or influence \nher. Applicant testified she is a valued employee, and has an excellent reputation \namong her clients and employers for protecting the Government\u2019s interest. Applicant \nasserted she has strong morals, values and integrity, which have allowed her to work in \npositions of trust (Tr. 25). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                          \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in her credit reports, her SOR \nresponse, and her testimony. She received Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1999. \nShortly thereafter, she acquired numerous debts which became delinquent and have \nremained outstanding. As of the hearing date, she had nine outstanding debts totaling \napproximately $66,000. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                          \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,6 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact \ncreditors, or to resolve any of the debts since she acquired them. Nor is there any \nevidence that she has participated in any financial counseling. I specifically considered \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b): \u201cThe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d, and \nconclude it applies, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony established factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., \nbeing a single mother, and sole provider for her three children, two grandchildren, and \nher mother; the lack of financial assistance from her adult children and her ex-husband \n(while they were married); her father\u2019s medical expenses; her bad business decisions to \npurchase a home beyond her financial means and to cash in her civil service retirement \nfund; and the additional expenses associated with her job lateral transfers, moves, and \nwork-related travel. \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt \nresponsibly with her financial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. \nApplicant has been consistently employed since 1982. From 2004 to 2006 she earned \naround $75,000 a year, and from 2006 to the present she earned approximately \n$110,000 a year. She presented little or no evidence to show paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that she \nhas established a track record of financial responsibility, or that she has taken control of \nher financial situation. Based on the available evidence, she is overextended financially \nand her financial problems are likely to be a concern in the future. Her financial \nproblems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \n\n \n \n9 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s 26-years of working for the Government and Government contractors \nweighs in her favor. She has had access to classified information for 26 years and there \nis no evidence that she ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation. She is considered a valued employee who is diligent, responsible, and \nprofessional. Aside from her delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-criminal issue), she \nis a law-abiding citizen, a concerned mother and grateful daughter. She expressed \nregrets for her financial mistakes and claimed she is trying to correct them.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in her case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, maturity, her years working for the Government and defense \ncontractors, she demonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of \nher financial affairs. Because of her age, education, and job experience she knew or \nshould have known of the Government\u2019s security concerns. She failed to deal \nresponsibly with her financial obligations, especially after receipt of the SOR. Her failure \nor inability to live within her means and to meet her financial obligations indicates poor \nself-control or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Her behavior raises \nquestions about her reliability, and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l and 1.m: \n Against Applicant \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant rebutted or mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns raised under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. His eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \nOn June 12, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (EPSQ). \nOn November 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nJ and E. The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 10, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 11, 2008, \nMay 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing seven \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 13, 2008.  Applicant received \nthe FORM on February 21, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. Applicant submitted a Response to the FORM and \nadditional exhibits on or about March 16, 2008, that I marked, as Applicant Exhibits (AE) \n1 through 7.1 Department Counsel had no objection to the documents. DOHA assigned \nthe case to me on March 27, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He admitted the allegations contained in \u00b6 2.a, and denied the allegation \ncontained in \u00b6 2.b. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He \nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n    \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He has been married for 19 years and has two \nchildren. In November 1998, he began working as a test engineer for his current \nemployer, a federal contractor. In January 1999, he received a Secret security \nclearance. In June 2006, he submitted an EPSQ, in which he disclosed three offenses, \noccurring in 1988, 2004 and 2006. He also listed two delinquent debts. (Item 4).  \n \n \nIn 1988, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence. He was fined \nand his driver\u2019s license was suspended. He was 18 years old, immature, and was \nassociating with the \u201cwrong crowd.\u201d (Item 3). He earned an Associate in Applied \nScience degree in March 1990, and has \u201cbeen gainfully employed ever since.\u201d (Id.). \n \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant was charged with Pass ing a Stopped School Bus and \nlater fined. At the time of the incident, he was driving on a four-lane divided highway and \ndid not notice that a school bus had stopped until it was too late. He did not intentionally \nfail to stop when he mistakenly passed the bus. He reported the incident to his security \nofficer. This was the only traffic violation that he had in many years. (Item 3). He \u201cwhole-\nheartedly\u201d appreciates the gravity of the situation and the potential risk he created for \npeople at the time of his driving error. (Response to FORM at 3). \n \n \nIn May 2006, Applicant and his wife became embroiled in a domestic argument \nwhile he was intoxicated. He subsequently left the house, but returned within minutes to \nretrieve some of his personal belongings and found the doors locked. He knocked the \ndoor down and his wife called the police. Before leaving the house, he grabbed his two \nguns. He then fled the scene and hid his guns in the wooded area behind his house. He \nthen returned to his house and became involved in an argument with the police, during \nwhich he broke the police car\u2019s windshield with a brick. The police arrested him and \ncharged him with (1) Breaking and Entering, amended to Criminal Mischief, and (2) \nMenacing. In July 2006, he pleaded guilty to Criminal Mischief, and was sentenced to \n                                                          \n1 Applicant referred to his exhibits as Items and numbered them 1 through 7. For purposes of \nclarity, I will refer to them as AE 1 through 7. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n365 days confinement, suspended, and placed on two years of probation. He was fined \nand ordered to pay restitution, in addition to attending an anger management program. \nHe also pleaded guilty to Menacing and was sentenced to 180 days, suspended, and \ntwo years of probation. He was ordered to enroll in a drug/alcohol program. On July 31, \n2007, his probation was terminated early on both charges. (AE 4). \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed the May 2006 criminal charge on his June 2006 EPSQ. In \nDecember 2006, a government investigator interviewed him about that incident. Prior to \nthe interview, he conferred with his local security officer, who advised him to give \u201ca \nspecific answer to a specific question.\u201d (Response to FORM). Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he had thrown a brick through a police car window. He did not disclose, \nat the time, that he had brandished a firearm during the confrontation with the police or \nthat he had hidden the gun prior to his arrest. He did not mention the gun because he \nwas not charged with any crime related to the possession of a handgun. (Item 3). \u201cI \nwould have willingly and openly discussed the events of May 26, 2006 if the interview \nwould have lent itself to such a format. Instead the format was nothing more than a \n\u2018question and answer\u2019 session.\u201d (Id.). He denied that he intentionally attempted to \nwithhold information from the government. Although he had not seen the police report, \nhe knew the investigator would obtain a copy of it and had no reason to lie. (Id.). His \nexplanation for omitting the details regarding the gun is credible. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges major changes occurred in his life as a result of that \nincident. He participated in counseling and completed the recommended treatment plan. \n(AE 7). After doing so, he \u201cmade adequate changes in [his] lifestyle in an effort to \npermanently remove the stressors that led to the events of May 26, 2006.\u201d (Item 3). He \nlost weight through exercising and renewed his interests in hobbies. He completely \nremoved alcohol from his life. He stated that \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to commit another act \nlike I did on May 26, 2006 and I\u2019m actively pursuing things that make me a better person \nfor my family, friends and employer.\u201d (Id. at 4).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted character letters from his wife, a family friend, and his \nsupervisor. His wife refers to him as a \u201ccaring and loving husband and father.\u201d (AE 1). \nShe believes the May 2006 incident was completely out of character for him and was \nthe result of his consuming alcohol while taking prescribed pain medication for dental \nproblems. The incident subsequently had a positive effect on their family. (Id.). His \nfriend has also witnessed a positive change in Applicant since the event. (AE 3). \nApplicant immediately informed his supervisor of the incident after it occurred in May \n2006. The supervisor, who has known Applicant for over 10 years, has great confidence \nand praise for Applicant. He has heard Applicant express remorse for the incident \nseveral times and finds the event out of character for Applicant. He considers Applicant \nto be an \u201cexemplary employee.\u201d (AE 2).     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n4 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe Government\u2019s concerns regarding criminal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 30: \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n\n \n5 \n \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Based on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions regarding the \ncriminal conduct in 1988 and 2006, the Government established a potential security \nconcern under two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions: \u201ca single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses,\u201d and an \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). In July 2007, the court terminated Applicant\u2019s probation \nearly; hence, AG \u00b6 31(d) that is applicable when an \u201cindividual is currently on parole or \nprobation\u201d does not apply. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation. \nThere are five Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 32, one of which \napplies to the 1988 DUI conviction. AG \u00b6 32(a) provides mitigation when \u201cso much time \nhas elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  This charge occurred approximately 20 \nyears ago when Applicant was 18 years old. Since that time, he earned a college \ndegree, maintained employment, and undergone significant changes in his life, such \nthat similar incidents are unlikely to recur.   \nAG \u00b6 32 (d) has some application to the allegations set forth in \u00b6 1.b of the SOR, \nas \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.\u201d Since his 2006 conviction, Applicant has participated in counseling, \nsuccessfully complied with all the terms of the court-imposed probation, including \nmaking restitution and paying his fine, expressed remorse for his mistakes, and \npresented letters from his boss, wife and friend, asserting that his misconduct was \naberrational. Recognizing the gravity of his conduct, he has since made significant life \nchanges. There is no evidence of any criminal misconduct since May 2006, \napproximately two years ago. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the Government\u2019s personal conduct concern: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance \nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant was fined for illegally \npassing a stopped bus in 2004, and in \u00b6 2.b that he was not completely candid during \nan investigative interview about the 2006 criminal charge. Based on the evidence in the \nrecord pertaining to these two allegations, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the \nGovernment raised a potential Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 \n16(d). The security concern is based on \u201ccredible adverse information that is not \nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d  Taken \ntogether, these allegations demonstrate instances of questionable judgment on \nApplicant\u2019s part.  \nThe Government argued that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose information related to \nhis possession and brandishing of a handgun on May 26, 2006, was deliberate, and \nthus raised a potential disqualification under AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads \u201cthe deliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d Applicant denied the allegation and attributed the omission to the \nadvice he received from his security officer regarding the manner in which he should \nrespond to the investigation, and, the fact that because he had not been charged with a \ncrime involving the possession of a handgun he did not include information about it. \nCoupled with his honest disclosure of the above three offenses and adverse financial \ninformation, I found those explanations credible, and hence, that he did not deliberately \nconceal information from the Government.  \n \nSeven Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions are set forth in AG \u00b6 17. After \nreviewing all of the conditions, I conclude two of them apply to the two disqualifications: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n Applicant acknowledged his misconduct in both instances and expressed \nremorse and embarrassment about them. He received counseling after the 2006 \ncriminal incident, which gave him insight into the stressors underlying it, and has \nsubsequently helped him manage stress. He has made other changes in his life, and \nhas no intention of repeating similar behaviors in the future. Hence, AG \u00b617 (d) applies. \nHe disclosed the 2004 driving violation to his supervisor and the 2006 criminal \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmisconduct to his supervisor and a good friend, which reduces his vulnerability to \nexploitation, and warrants the application of AG \u00b617 (e).  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 38-year-old man, who \nhas successfully worked for his current employer since 1998, during which time he has \nheld a security clearance. Throughout the record, he expressed, repeatedly, his great \nremorse and shame over the 2006 criminal misconduct, and acknowledged his previous \nimmature behavior in 1988 and the careless driving event in 2004. He stopped \nconsuming alcohol in 2006, a factor in the 1988 and 2006 incidents. His wife and good \nfriend have witnessed a positive change in him since the 2006 incident. His employer \nfinds him an exemplary employee. The court terminated his probationary term one-year \nearly. All of these facts are indications that it is unlikely that similar behaviors will occur \nin the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising from personal conduct and criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 25, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 29, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n\nFor example, the November 2004 credit report (Exhibit 7) lists two numbers for each account and one of\n1\nthe two numbers is the same for each account. \n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nSOR Allegations 1a and 1b: Applicant is alleged to be indebted to Unifund in\nthe amounts of $14,730.00 and $14,618.00. Exhibit 7 indicates these are most likely the\nsame debt. Applicant claims this debt was one of many his former wife secretly incurred\nwhile he was deployed overseas with the U.S. Navy, which he has disputed as not\nbeing his debt. The most recent Equifax report in the file (Exhibit 9) identifies applicant\nas an \u201cextended fraud victim,\u201d and unlike the previous Equifax report (Exhibit 8), does\nnot list  this alleged debt.\nSOR Allegation 1c: There is conflicting evidence regarding this alleged\n$2,255.00 debt. Some evidence indicates applicant owed two debts to Wells Fargo in\nthe amounts of $2,255.00 and $3,017.00, and other evidence indicates the alleged\n$2,255.00 debt may be the same as the $3,017.00 debt.  In Exhibit 5 there is a letter\n1\nfrom a collection agency acknowledging applicant settled a debt to Wells Fargo \u201cin full\u201d\nby paying $2,500.00 to the collection agency in 2006. Adding to the confusion is the fact\nthat on the most recent credit report in the file (Exhibit 9), there are two Wells Fargo\ndebts listed, and neither of the two listings indicates there is any past-due amount\nowing. The credit report does indicate applicant has disputed the debts.\nSOR Allegations 1d, 1e and 1f: Applicant is alleged to be indebted in the\namounts of $57.00, $97.00, and $82.00 \u201cfor medical services as reflected in a January\n31, 2008, credit report.\u201d Applicant denies the allegations, and there is no January 31,\n2008 credit report in the record. These allegations are found for applicant.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n\n3\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant did have a few debts go\ndelinquent.  Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has successfully\ndisputed the alleged Unifund debt(s), either satisfied or disputed the Wells Fargo debt,\nand the Government failed to prove he is indebted on the three alleged medical bill\ndebts totaling $236.00. The little derogatory financial evidence the Government offered\ndoes not cast doubt on applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nAccordingly, this mitigation condition is applicable.\n\n4\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by conditions largely beyond his control;\nnamely his wife opening up numerous credit accounts without his knowledge while he\nwas deployed overseas. He acted responsibly by disputing some of the debts and\npaying off others. Accordingly, this mitigating condition is applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. It is clear the problem is under control.\nThis mitigating condition is applicable.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has either\nsatisfied or successfully disputed his debts. This mitigating condition is applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who,\nwhile honorably serving his country, had his finances destroyed by a dishonest spouse.\nAs a result, some of his financial obligations went delinquent. During the years since\ntheir divorce, applicant has satisfied some of these debts and has successfully disputed\nthe validity of the others. Based on the evidence presented, I conclude applicant\nmitigated the security concerns arising from Guideline F.\n\n5\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 3, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 20, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert C.\nWesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following factual findings: Applicant failed to file federal income tax\nreturns for the years 2001 through 2006 and state income tax returns for the years 1992 through\n2006.  As a result, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a lien for $8,844 against Applicant in\n2001, and state tax authorities filed two liens totaling $9,148 in 2006.  Due to another debt,\nApplicant incurred a judgement for $892 in 2000.  Applicant has not provided documentation of\npayment of any of those amounts or of five other delinquent debts.  Due to a period of\nunemployment, Applicant fell behind  on child-support payments and his other financial obligations.\nHe now owes only back-payments for child support.  \nIn December 2008, Applicant hired a tax relief firm to file his tax returns and settle his tax\nliabilities.  Applicant then filed an installment agreement request with the state tax authorities and\nexecuted a power of attorney for the firm to represent him in negotiations with the IRS.  However,\nas of the date of the hearing (December 15), Applicant had not filed any of the overdue tax returns\nor made any payments toward the tax liens.  Although the record was held open for Applicant to\nsubmit completed tax returns, installment agreements, and other evidence of his efforts to resolve\nhis tax liabilities and other debts, Applicant did not submit \u201ctangible evidence\u201d in that regard.\nDecision at 3-4.  It was not clear at that time whether Applicant had paid the $3,900 charged by the\ntax relief firm for their services.  Applicant had agreed to pay the firm $1,950 by January, but\nprovided no documentation of payment.\nAlong with his appeal, Applicant submitted completed federal tax forms and correspondence\nfrom the IRS.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29, the Board cannot consider this new evidence.               \nApplicant argues that through his contacts with the IRS he has mitigated any security\nconcerns that might exist under Guideline F and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give\nadequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all the record evidence, unless the record demonstrates otherwise; and there is no\nrequirement that the Judge mention or discuss every piece of record evidence when reaching a\ndecision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).   Applicant admitted\nthe SOR allegations against him.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by those allegations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Here, the Judge discussed the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and concluded that Applicant did not present\nevidence sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does\n\n3\nnot alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security determination.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.       \nSigned: Jean E.

The hearing was convened on the scheduled date for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing,\nthe Government's case consisted of 10 exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness\nFebruary 20, 2009\n\n2\n(himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 22, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented agreements with the IRS and his State covering his missing tax\nfilings and tax liens. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 30 days to January\n15, 2008 to supplement the record.  The Government was afforded two days to\nrespond.  Applicant supplemented the record with a faxed federal tax information\nauthorization, a state franchise tax board written installment agreement request, an IRS\npower of attorney and declaration of representative, a payment plan covering the listed\ncreditors in the SOR, and a planned budget.  Although the receipted documents were\nreceived several days past the due date, Department Counsel interposed no objections.\nFor good cause shown Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as exhibits C through G.\nApplicant did not include any actual agreements with the IRS and State.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) failed to file federal tax\nreturns for tax years 2001 through 2006, (b) failed to file state tax returns for tax years\n1992 through 2006, (c) accumulated an IRS tax lien in August 2001 for $8,874.00, (d)\naccumulated State tax liens in May 2006 for $4,303.00 and in September 2006 for\n$4,845.00, (e) incurred a judgment in May 2000 for $892.00 that has not been satisfied,\nand (f), accumulated five delinquent debts exceeding $3,900.00 that have not been\npaid.\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the listed allegations.\nHe provided no explanations and claimed no affirmative defenses.                                  \n            \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old electrical tech maintenance employee for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married his first wife (W1) in 1995 and divorced her in 2004, and living\napart for almost 10 years (see ex. 1; R.T., at 54-55).  He has four children by W1 (see\nex. 1).  One is a boy (age 21); the others are girls (ages 19 and 14).  Only the 14-year-\nold currently resides with W1 (R.T., at 69).  Applicant has no current child support\nresponsibilities for any of his children, only back-child support (R.T., at 69).\nApplicant failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2001 through\n2006.  He also failed to file State income tax returns for tax years 1992 through 2006\n\n3\n(see ex. 3).  The IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant in August 2001 for\n$8,844.00.  His State\u2019s Franchise Tax Board  filed tax liens against Applicant in May\n2006 for $4,303.00, and again in September 2006 for $4,845.00 (ex. 3).  None of these\nliens have been discharged to date.\nBesides his federal and state tax liens, Applicant incurred a judgment in May\n2000 in the amount of $892.00 and accumulated five delinquent debts exceeding\n$3,900.00 (see exs. 2, 4, 5, and 6).  To date, Applicant has not provided any receipts of\npayment or otherwise documented existing disputes with any of the listed creditors in\nthe SOR (see exs. 3, 7 and 8; R.T., at 54-59).\nApplicant attributes his tax filing failures and ensuing liens to disputes with W1\nover entitled tax exemptions for his children before and after their divorce in 2004.  He\nprovides no demonstrable proof of any of his claimed disputes or efforts to work with the\nIRS on resolving his claimed exemption dispute.  \nApplicant also disputes several of his other listed debts (e.g., creditor 1.g and\ncreditor 1.j).  He assures he returned his television unit to the vender, and is not\nresponsible for the medical bill, which was incurred by W1 before their divorce (R.T., at\n55-56).  He provides no receipts or other documentation to corroborate his claims,\nhowever, and these debts remain unpaid.  He acknowledges the judgment and\nremaining debts as his own, and explains they arose during a six-month period in 2006\nwhen he was out of work and fell behind with some of his creditors (R.T., at 63-64).\nWhile unemployed during this six-month period, he also got behind with his child\nsupport payments with W1 (R.T., at 64).  \nApplicant married his current wife (W2) in 1995.  She has one child of her own\n(age 28).  Since his marriage to W2, he brought his back-child support payments\ncurrent to W1 through retirement reductions (R.T., at 43), and is making every efforts to\npay his creditors.  Still, he has experienced recent financial set backs after his father-in-\nlaw became ill, and has required additional out-of-pocket expenses to take care of his\nmedical needs (R.T., at 64-66).  Complicating their repayment efforts, too are W2's (a\nnurse by profession) heavy driving expenses to finance her daily commute to her\ncurrent assignment (R.T., at 74-75).\nApplicant retained a tax relief firm in December 2008 to file his back tax returns\nwith the IRS and the State and resolve his tax liens (see ex. A; R.T., at 46-47).  He has\nsince completed an installment agreement request with the State and executed a power\nof attorney authorizing his tax relief firm to represent him in IRS negotiations (see exs. D\nand E).  Nonetheless, by the hearing date, he had not filed any of his back federal and\nstate tax returns covered in the SOR or paid any of the taxes covered in the listed\nfederal and state tax liens (R.T., at 45-50). \nAfforded a post-hearing opportunity to provide completed tax returns, installment\nagreements, or documented evidence of his resolving his outstanding tax liens and\nother listed debts, Applicant failed to furnish any proofs he has achieved any tangible\n\n4\nresults in resolving his tax and other debts.  It is not clear either whether Applicant has\npaid the tax firm its requested fee of $3,900.00 to underwrite its tax preparations and\nnegotiations in Applicant\u2019s behalf (R.T., at 50-51).  Applicant committed to send along\n$1,950.00 to the tax firm by January 2008 (R.T., at 51-52), but provided no\ndocumentation of his making this payment.\nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisor and security manager.  Both value\nhis honesty, integrity and trustworthiness (see ex. B).  They commend his strong ethics\nand devotion to his family and attest to his overall good character.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines (AG), \u00b6\n18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\n\n5\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a good electrical technician who has failed to file his personal and\nstate tax returns for a number of years and incurred tax liens with both the IRS and his\nState\u2019s Franchise Tax Board that have not been resolved. Records show that he also\nincurred a judgment and several other debts that have been not been paid or otherwise\nsafely resolved.  \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised AGs where the individual applicant fails to file federal and state tax returns\nand/or is so financially overextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and\nplace the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\ndocumented years of not filing his federal and state tax returns, his accumulation of\nfederal and state tax liens, his outstanding judgment and other  indebtedness, and his\npast inability to pay these debts warrant the application of three of the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: DC \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d\nand DC \u00b619(g), \u201c\u201dfailure to file annual Federal, state, and local income tax returns as\nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d\nApplicant claims disputes over his exemption entitlements were partially\nresponsible for his recurrent failures to file his tax returns, he provides no documentation\nof any disputes with W1, or any good-faith attempts to work with responsible federal and\n\n6\nstate tax officials.  While he has taken recent steps to engage a tax relief firm to assist\nhim in preparing his back tax returns and work out payment arrangements, he has\nachieved no tangible results to date in filing his taxes or resolving his outstanding tax\nliens.   Nor has he been able to make any visible headway in discharging the outstanding\njudgment against him or paying or resolving his other documented delinquent debts.  In a\nnutshell, Applicant\u2019s efforts remain a work in progress with no tangible input by which to\ngauge his progress.\nMitigation credit to Applicant is very limited based on his furnished proofs.  At this\ntime, all of Applicant\u2019s outstanding tax returns and liens remain unresolved. The same\nholds true with the judgment debt and accumulated debt delinquencies identified in the\nSOR.  As a result, MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be applied to\nApplicant\u2019 situation.  MC \u00b6 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has no applicability either based on\nApplicant\u2019s failure to document any repayment efforts with his listed creditors and\nprovide satisfactory proofs that the tax and other debts covered by subparagraphs 1.c\nthrough 1.k have been paid.  \n                                                       \nBecause Applicant has chosen recently to seek counseling advice relative to his\nidentified tax filing failures and tax liens, he may take limited advantage of MC \u00b6 20(c)\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  While there is some\nreason to anticipate future resolution of his federal tax issues based on his documented\ninstallment agreement request with the State and his executed power of attorney with his\ntax relief firm, he has produced no tangible progress with the IRS or State Franchise Tax\nBoard to date.  Nor does he provide any tangible evidence of repayment efforts with the\nconsumer judgment holder or other creditors covered in the SOR. Considered together,\nApplicant\u2019s efforts are not enough to warrant any more than partial application of MC \u00b6\n20(c).   Lack of documentation also precludes him from taking any more than minimal\nadvantage of MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue.\u201d  \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not help Applicant to overcome the judgment\nlapses associated with his tax filing failure, tax liens and consumer judgment and debt\nconcerns.  His good work history and family devotion to his current wife and children are\n\n7\ncommendable and deserving of praise.  His failure, though, to diligently monitor and\nensure timely tax filings and payments to the IRS and State in connection with his\npersonal tax responsibilities, and otherwise attend to his consumer debts covered in the\nSOR reflects the lack of minimal judgment and trust required for holding a security\nclearance.  These concerns are not mitigated under the whole person concept.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunresolved tax filing failures, tax liens, and debt accumulations, his earnest but still\nmostly unsuccessful steps to resolve them, and the absence of sufficient efforts to\ndemonstrate his financial responsibility and trustworthiness in managing his finances,\nApplicant does not mitigate security concerns related to his tax filing failures, tax liens\nand other proven debt delinquencies. While Applicant is to be commended and\nencouraged in his repayment efforts, more tangible proofs of success are necessary to\nsatisfy minimum standards of security eligibility.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.k. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a, through 1.k:\nAGAINST APPLICANT    \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nOn April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 5, 2008, and requested an administrative\ndetermination. On October 15, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nApril 22, 2010\n\n2\nMaterial. (FORM) Applicant received the FORM on October 22, 2009, and did not\nrespond. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old single woman with two children. She earned a GED in\n2002. For the past four years, she has worked for a defense contractor as a stockroom\nassociate. (Item 8 at 9)\nApplicant and her ex-boyfriend, the father of her two children, had a contentious\nrelationship that led to multiple conflicts requiring police intervention during an 18-month\nperiod between 2003 and 2004. In May 2003, Applicant attempted to break the\napartment window of a woman whom her boyfriend had been dating secretly. (Item 11\nat 1-3, 8) Subsequently, Applicant was charged with malicious destruction of property.\n(Item 10 at 4) Applicant pleaded guilty, and the court deferred judgment. Applicant was\nfined and placed on probation for three months. After serving probation without incident,\nthe court dismissed the case.\nIn November 2003, Applicant\u2019s boyfriend filed a domestic violence charge against\nher. (Item 14 at 25) The charge was later nolle prossed. (Item 10 at 6) \nIn January 2004, Applicant punctured the tires of her boyfriend\u2019s car after an\nargument. (Item 9 at 3) She was charged with malicious destruction of property. After\npleading guilty, she was fined, sentenced to 12 months of probation, and ordered to pay\nrestitution.\nIn February 2004, Applicant, enraged at her boyfriend\u2019s continuing infidelity,\nscratched his car with a box cutter and attempted to slash his tires. (Item 9 at 3)\nSubsequently, she was arrested and charged with malicious destruction of property.\nApplicant pleaded guilty, and the court sentenced her to two days in jail, twelve months\nprobation, and ordered her to pay restitution. (Item 11 at 10-11)\nIn April 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with retail fraud and disturbing\nthe peace after a department store security officer detained her and two friends for\nallegedly shoplifting. (Item 14 at 16) Later, the court dropped the retail fraud charge, and\nApplicant pleaded guilty to the remaining charge, whereupon the court imposed a fine.\n(Item 10 at 17) \nThe arresting officer interviewed Applicant shortly after the arrest. She told him\nshe was in the store shopping with her friends when she observed them shoplifting.\n(Item 13 at 19) When discussing this incident with an Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator in 2007, Applicant stated that she was sitting in the car in the store\u2019s\nparking lot while her friends were shopping and did not know anything was awry until\nthey ran out of the store followed by police officers. (Item 9 at 3) I find that Applicant\nwas in the store when her friends began shoplifting items and observed the criminal\nactivity as it occurred.\n\n3\nIn August 2004, Applicant was working as a cashier in a convenience store. (Item\n11 at 30) One evening, she became irritated after her supervisor reprimanded her. Her\nsupervisor then instructed her to go to the office area in the back of the store to \u201ccalm\ndown.\u201d The supervisor followed Applicant to the office to speak with her further about\nher performance. During the discussion, Applicant punched the supervisor in the jaw\nand sprayed her with pepper spray. The supervisor then ran from the room and\ninstructed another employee to call the police.\nSubsequently, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) assault with a\ndangerous weapon, and (2) assault and battery. (Item 10 at 19) At a plea hearing on\nSeptember 22, 2004, Applicant pleaded guilty to the first charge. (Item 10 at 21) On\nSeptember 28, 2004, the court dismissed the second charge, and sentenced Applicant\nto 60 days in jail to be served with electronic monitoring. (Item 10 at 21) Also, the court\nordered Applicant to report to jail for installation of electronic monitoring by October 1,\n2004. Applicant failed to report to court for the installation of the electronic monitor,\nprompting the court, on October 7, 2004, to issue a bench warrant for her arrest.\nOn September 28, 2004, the same day Applicant was sentenced for assault with\na dangerous weapon, she drove her car toward two women sitting in a parked vehicle.\n(Item 14 at 3) When she reached the side of the car, she reached out of the window\nwith a box cutter and scratched the side of their car. (Item 14 at 4) Once the victim\ndrove the car out of the parking lot, Applicant continued to harass her by following her,\nand nearly forcing her off the road. Subsequently, Applicant was charged with malicious\ndestruction of property. \nWhen Applicant appeared at court for her arraignment on October 26, 2004, she\nwas arrested on the outstanding warrant stemming from the September 2004 assault\nand battery conviction. (Item 14 at 30) That day, the court consolidated the case\nstemming from the August 2004 offense and the case stemming from the September\n2004 offense, then amended the September order by requiring Applicant to spend 12\ndays in jail. (Item 14 at 12) Next, the court scheduled a sentencing hearing for\nDecember 2004 for the malicious destruction of property offense.\nOn December 13, 2004, court sentenced Applicant to 48 days in jail (Item 14 at\n25). It is unclear from the record whether Applicant actually served any of this time.\nContrary to the allegation listed in SOR subparagraph 1.h, Applicant was not charged\nwith any additional criminal offenses after the September 2004 incident.\nBetween 2003 and 2004, Applicant was ticketed four times for traffic infractions.\nOne of them, which she received for following too close behind a vehicle, stemmed from\nan incident where she rammed her car into the back of her then-boyfriend\u2019s vehicle\nwhile he was at a stop sign preparing to cross an intersection. (Item 12 at 1)\nApplicant was raised in an unstable home by an abusive, alcoholic mother (Item\n4 at 3). Her troubled childhood, particularly the physical abuse she experienced, left her\n\n4\nunable to cope with stressors, such as the troubled relationship with her then-boyfriend,\nwithout resorting to violence.\nApplicant and her boyfriend are no longer together. In May 2006, she relocated\nto an area more than a thousand miles away from where she had her difficulties with the\nlaw. (Item 8 at 5) She enrolled in community college and, as of the date of the SOR\nanswer, was on schedule to graduate. (Item 7 at 4) She has been working steadily at\nher job, and recently received a raise.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in 2007. She did not\ndisclose any of her arrests, as required in response to Section 23.f. (Item 8 at 25) In her\nanswer, Applicant contends that she \u201cmisunderstood the charges or convictions that\nwere held against [her],\u201d mistakenly assuming that she was only to list felonies. (Item 7\nat 1; Item 9 at 4)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\nFor an analysis of this issue, See Personal Conduct section of the Decision, infra.\n1\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201ca\nsingle serious crime, or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged or convicted.\u201d\nFor the past four years, Applicant has been focused on working, raising her children,\nand attending college. She has not committed any criminal incidents similar to those\nshe committed before relocating.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s 2007 falsification of her security clearance application1\nconstitutes a crime under 18 USC \u00a7 1001. Consequently, she has not been completely\nfree of criminal behavior since ending the relationship with her boyfriend and moving to\nanother state. I conclude that her college attendance is enough to trigger the partial\napplication of AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d However, it is insufficient to mitigate the criminal conduct\nsecurity concern in light of the seriousness of the conduct and her recent failure to\ndisclose it on her security clearance application. Applicant has failed to mitigate the\ncriminal conduct security concern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern under this adjudicative guideline is set forth in Paragraph\n15, as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s omission of her criminal arrests from the 2007 security clearance\napplication raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n6\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\nApplicant was arrested four times and charged with crimes on three additional\noccasions between 2003 and 2004. Four of Applicant\u2019s charges were for the same\ncrime, malicious destruction of property. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that she omitted the charges from the security clearance application because\nshe did not understand their nature is not credible. I conclude Applicant falsified\nQuestion 23.f of the security clearance application, and AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without\nmitigation.\nSOR subparagraph 2.f alleges as follows:\nDuring a February 5, 2007 interview with an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense concerning the information set for in subparagraph\n1.e, above, you falsified material facts in that you stated that you had\npurchased some items at a store and returned to the car to wait for your\nacquaintances who had shoplifted without your knowledge; whereas in\ntruth, you deliberately failed to disclose that you had placed items in a cart\nfrom where your acquaintances would then conceal them in their coats\nand that all of you were apprehended as you left the store.\nThe record evidence does not establish that Applicant placed items in the\nshopping cart \u201cfrom where [her] acquaintances would then conceal them in their coats.\u201d\nHowever, the evidence does establish that Applicant\u2019s explanation to the OPM\ninvestigator regarding what she was doing while her friends were shoplifting\ncontradicted her earlier explanation to the arresting officer. Consequently, I conclude\nApplicant falsified SOR subparagraph 2.f, also. Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. \nThe administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n7\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was in her late teens and early twenties when she committed the\ncriminal conduct. She appears to have matured, as demonstrated by her maintaining a\nsteady job and attending college, while raising her children.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s falsifications during the investigative process generate\nquestions about her credibility and undercut the presence of rehabilitation. After\nevaluating this case in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude Applicant\nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",
