Harvey, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 29 January 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines C and E.  Applicant answered the SOR 20 March 2008, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 14 May 2008, and I convened a hearing 5\nJune 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 16 June 2008.\n \nJune 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 53-year-old accountant\nemployed by a defense contractor since October 1997. He seeks to retain the security\nclearance he has held since about April 2006. Although he does not know what, if any,\nclearance were granted, he has been the subject of U.S. government background\ninvestigations in November 1998, April 2005, and April 2006 for his contract work with\nother government agencies.\nApplicant was born in Nigeria in August 1954. He was raised there and educated\nthere through high school. He became an accountant by on-the-job training. He\nimmigrated to the U.S. in August 1980 to go to college, having obtained an education\nvisa.  He eventually obtained both undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. Along the\nway, he was able to covert his education visa into a work visa. He became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in February 1995. At that time, he surrendered the Nigerian passport that\nU.S. immigration law required him to maintain. Later that year, he obtained his first U.S.\npassport. He renewed his U.S. passport in September 2005.\nIn February 1990, Applicant married a Nigerian national he met in the U.S. She\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2000. Applicant and his wife have four\nchildren, all native-born U.S. citizens.\nApplicant and his wife traveled to Nigeria in 2001 with his children to show them\nwhere he grew up. They traveled on their U.S. passports. In 2003, Applicant had\ndisciplinary problems with his teenage daughter and thought she might be less blase\nabout her privileged live in the U.S. if she experienced school in Nigeria. He enrolled her\nin a private school and traveled to Nigeria for a week in 2003 to take her to school.\nAgain, he traveled on his U.S. passport. When\u2014lesson learned\u2014she implored him to\ntake her out of school, he returned to Nigeria on his U.S. passport in 2004.\nThe difficulty and expense of obtaining the necessary visa from the Nigerian\nEmbassy bothered Applicant on two counts. The difficulty made travel visas\ninconvenient. The expense Applicant viewed as enriching a corrupt Nigerian\ngovernment. Applicant believed it would be both more convenient and less enriching to\nthe Nigerian government if he obtained a Nigerian passport, and\u2014being unaware of any\nreason not to\u2014applied for one. He received his Nigerian passport in August 2004. He\nused it to enter and exit Nigeria in December 2005 and December 2007, although he\nused his U.S. passport to re-enter the U.S. He made these trips to visit his brothers.\nApplicant fully disclosed his foreign connections on his August 2006 clearance\napplication (G.E. 1) and fully discussed them during a July 2007 subject interview (G.E.\n2). During his interview, he stated his willingness to surrender his Nigerian passport and\nrenounce his Nigerian citizenship. When he became aware of the security concerns\nraised by his possession and use of a Nigerian passport, he surrendered his passport\nand stated his intent to renounce his Nigerian citizenship to the Nigerian Embassy on 7\n\n3\nMarch 2008 (Answer). He received confirmation of the surrender and renunciation from\nthe Nigerian Embassy in May 2008 (A.E. A).\nApplicant\u2019s two brothers are resident citizens of Nigeria. Neither is connected to\nthe Nigerian government. One brother is a farmer; the other is a town planner at a\ngovernmental level equivalent to a state government in the U.S. He has frequent\nenough contact with his brothers, mostly the town planner. The farmer doesn\u2019t have a\ntelephone.\nAside from applying for and using a Nigerian passport, Applicant has not\nexercised his dual citizenship with Nigeria since becoming a U.S. citizen. He has no\nfinancial or other interests in Nigeria. He has no contacts with Nigeria other than his two\nbrothers. All his financial interests are in the U.S. He owns his own accounting firm. He\nhas voted in every election in the U.S. since becoming a U.S. citizen. \nApplicant\u2019s character witness was both a schoolmate of Applicant\u2019s growing up in\nNigeria and an active-duty military officer with 23-years combined enlisted and\ncommissioned service. A naturalized U.S. citizen himself, he has held a clearance for\nover ten years. He described the depth of Applicant\u2019s commitment to the U.S. and\nvoiced no concerns with Applicant having access to classified information. He also\nconfirmed that many Nigerians retain their U.S. passports after becoming U.S. citizens\nbecause of the visa hassles with the Nigerian Embassy. Applicant\u2019s character\nreferences (A.E. B), both of whom know Applicant professionally, consider him\nextremely honest and trustworthy and eligible to retain his clearance.\nNigeria\u2014a part of the British Empire first as a sphere of British influence in 1885,\nthen as a colony and protectorate in 1914\u2014was granted independence from the United\nKingdom in October 1960. Since independence, the government has experienced\nmultiple periods of political unrest, including military takeovers of the government.\nHowever, the military has generally ceded power back to civilian government, most\nrecently in May 1999. Although Nigeria has a poor human rights record, it has been a\nstaunch supporter of the U.S. global war on terrorism. Furthermore, since independence\nNigerian foreign policy has been characterized by a focus on Africa and adherence to\nseveral fundamental principles: African unity and independence; peaceful settlement of\ndisputes; nonalignment and nonintentional interference in the internal affairs of other\nnations; and regional economic cooperation and development. Nigeria is the largest\nU.S. trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa, and the U.S. is second only to the United\nKingdom in trade with Nigeria. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria. Nigeria\nis not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive economic information. Nigeria is\nnot known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. The U.S. Department\nof State characterizes the foreign relations between the U.S. and Nigeria as excellent. \nNevertheless, violent crime, committed by ordinary criminals as well as by\npersons in police and military uniforms, can occur throughout the country. Kidnaping for\nransom of persons associated with the petroleum section, including U.S. citizens,\nremains common in the Niger Delta region. A travel warning issued in January 2007\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n4\nwarns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and of further deterioration of the\nsecurity situation in the Niger Delta region. The travel warning also notes that al Qaida\nleadership has expressed an interest in overthrowing the Nigeria government.\nAlthough the civilian government since 1999 was characterized by political unrest\nand corruption, an opposition candidate was elected in May 2007 and power transferred\npeacefully. The new government has been working on necessary electoral and other\nreforms.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by\nshowing that Applicant obtained and used a Nigerian passport after becoming a\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n3\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n4\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n5\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n6\n\u00b6 11(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n7\n\u00b6 11(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n8\ninvalidated; \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n9\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n10\n5\nnaturalized U.S. citizen.  However Applicant mitigated the Guideline C security\n3\nconcerns. Record evidence demonstrates that his exercise of Nigerian citizenship was\ninnocuous, sensible, and unwitting. That alone would not excuse the exercise of\nNigerian citizenship. His dual citizenship was based on his actively renewing or affirming\nhis Nigerian citizenship.  All exercise of dual citizenship occurred while he was an\n4\nadult.  Applicant's use of his Nigerian passport was not sanctioned by the U.S.\n5\n6\nHowever, Applicant has met the two most salient mitigating conditions. He has\nexpressed\u2014and acted upon\u2014a willingness to renounce his foreign citizenship.  He\n7\nstated\u2014and acted upon\u2014willingness to invalidate his passport.  Applicant has resided\n8\nin the U.S. nearly 30 years. His interests and his roots are well established here. I\nresolve Guideline C for Applicant.\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n9\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.10\n\n6\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B. Considering first the foreign country involved, Nigeria and the U.S. enjoy\nexcellent foreign relations. However, while Nigeria focuses its foreign policy largely in\nthe region, it has actively cooperated with the U.S. in ending global terrorism. Nigeria is\nnot known to target protected U.S. information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to\nobtain protected information. Further, in this case it is not clear what further claim\nNigeria might have on Applicant. He has both renounced his Nigerian citizenship and\nsurrendered his Nigerian passport to the Nigerian government. The risk that Nigeria\nmight seek protected information from Applicant is low, if not non-existent.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s situation in relation to the Nigerian government, the\ngovernment produced no evidence that there was any risk, much less a heightened risk,\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of\nApplicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s travel to Nigeria has no\nindependent security significance given that Nigeria is not known to be targeting U.S.\ncitizens for information. The security significance of travel under most circumstances is\ndemonstrating an applicant\u2019s affection for family members, which Applicant\u2019s December\n2005 and December 2007 trips to visit his brothers certainly corroborate, and which\nApplicant does not dispute. But neither brother is connected to the Nigerian government\nnor otherwise situated to be exploited for information gathering. There is nothing in the\ncircumstances of their being in Nigeria, or in Applicant\u2019s contacts with them, to heighten\nthe risk that he could be impelled to provide protected information to Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s\ntrip to Nigeria to show his family the country where he grew up (2001) and to give his\ncomplacent teenage daughter a life lesson (2003 and 2004) lack even that attenuated\nsecurity concern. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.  The following four conditions may be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; and,  \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant has two arrests within a 14 month period.  Both arrests occurred when \nApplicant was under 21 years of age.  The first arrest was for possession a marijuana, \nand the second arrest for speeding, DUI, and possession of alcohol by an underage \nperson pursuant to state law.  Applicant pled guilty to both offenses.  AG \u00b6 31(a) \napplies.  Applicant admitted these offenses.  AG \u00b6 31(c) applies.  He is currently on a \nthree year probation.  AG \u00b6 31(d) applies.  He violated his marijuana probation when \narrested for DUI in 2006, resulting in a longer probation until 2010, and a one-year \ndriving privilege suspension.  AG \u00b6 31(e) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, AG \u00b6 32 (b) and (c) are clearly not applicable because he \nadmitted he committed the driving offense freely and without coercion.  The marijuana \noffense he denied because he contended the pipe and residue was not his, but there \nwas sufficient evidence from the police officer to support the offense, and Applicant pled \nguilty to it. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe first offense occurred in September 2005, and the second in November \n2006, all within the past three-year period.  That time is not enough to trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 32 (a).  Nor were there any unusual circumstances in either of these \nincidents.  This mitigating condition does not apply. \n \nFinally, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32 (d) requires successful rehabilitation.  \nApplicant earned his college degree, and apparently a good work record, but did not \nsubmit any recommendations from his supervisors to confirm that he is a good and \ndutiful worker; however, he remains on probation.  This mitigating condition has limited \napplication.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical \npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an \nalcohol rehabilitation program; and, \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOf these seven disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6 22 (a) and (c) are applicable.  \nApplicant received a DUI in 2006 for drinking and driving, when he was under his state\u2019s \nlegal drinking age of 21 years.  He pled guilty to the offense, and had his driving \nprivileges suspended.  His Answer and statements show that over a three-year period \nof time from age 17 that he built an alcohol tolerance of up to 15 beers a night.  He \ndemonstrated impaired judgment by driving drunk, and speeding at 100 m.p.h. in a 60 \nm.p.h. zone. \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a \npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or \ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or \nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a \nsimilar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program. \n  \nApplicant showed a strong pattern of excessive consumption of alcohol, resulting \nin dangerous misconduct as shown by his DUI arrest.  His statements show the pattern \nof his alcohol consumption. AG  \u00b6 23 (a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant admitted alcohol caused him some problems, and allegedly ceased his \nconsumption to avoid further problems.  But he did not submit any objective evaluations, \nor other evidence of actions he has taken to avoid the problems in the future. AG \u00b6 23 \n(b) does not apply to Applicant.   Nor does AG \u00b623 (c) apply because there is no \nevidence to support it. \n \nAG \u00b6 23 (d) applies only if there is evidence of counseling and rehabilitation, with \nrequired aftercare, participation in Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, and \na favorable prognosis from a medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who \nare staff members of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  Applicant has submitted \nno evidence to support the application of this mitigating condition.  The alcohol \n\n \n7 \n \n \neducation program he attended as part of his court disposition in the DUI case does not \nmeet these criteria either.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 21-year-old male with \ntwo arrests for violations of state laws on possession of marijuana, and possession of \nalcohol as a minor, DUI, and speeding.  This frequent misconduct within a 14 month \nperiod indicates immaturity and irresponsibility.  His actions were voluntary, especially \nhis speeding and DUI.  There is a strong likelihood of recurrence based on Applicant\u2019s \npast immature and selfish actions, in addition to the lack of evidence of substantive \nevidence of alcohol rehabilitation .  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and \nalcohol consumption misconduct.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 29, 2008. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJuly 24, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received on March 25, 2008, and she\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 6, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on June 25, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 3, 2008.\nThe record was left open until July 18, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity to\nsubmit additional documentary evidence. She did so, and those matters are admitted,\nwithout objections, as follows: (1) Exhibit D\u2013cover letter; (2) Exhibit E\u2013divorce decree;\n(3) Exhibit F\u2013recent pay stub; (4) Exhibit G\u2013401(k) account information; and (5) Exhibit\nH\u2013proof of payment for the gas bill in collection. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges four delinquent debts for a total of about\n$41,000. The delinquent debts consist of a collection account for a gas bill and three\ncharged-off credit card accounts. In her Answer, she admitted the debts and provided a\none-page letter explaining the circumstances surrounding the debts. In addition, the\nfollowing facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked as a\nUnix system administrator for this company since March 2007. She is seeking to obtain\nan industrial security clearance for the first time.   \nShe married in 1994 at age 18, and she divorced in 2005 (Exhibit E). She is\nraising three children, ages 13, 6, and 3, without the benefit of child support as her ex-\nhusband stopped making $1,781 monthly payments in about July 2006. She attributes\nthe divorce to her husband\u2019s infidelity and abuse of alcohol and drugs (Tr. 45). She\nrelocated to her current state of residence in 2006. In her Answer, she described the\ncircumstances of her relocation as follows:\nIn the summer of 2005, my marriage ended. In the summer of 2006 my\nex-husband became abusive and for safety reasons I quit my job and\nmoved to [State A]. Literally, woke up one morning, quit job, packed two\nboxes, loaded my car and moved to [State A]. I have been rebuilding ever\nsince. It took 2 months to find another job and it wasn\u2019t at the same pay\nlevel. I had to start at the bottom again and work my way back up. Things\nare finally starting to turn around. I\u2019m back in school finishing up my\n\n3\nbachelor\u2019s degree. The debt in question will be paid off. Granted, it\u2019s not\nsomething that will happen over night. It will take time to correct.\nIn her hearing testimony, she clarified her admissions in that she was disputing\nresponsibility for the collection account and one of the charged-off credit card accounts.\nShe took responsibility for the other two charged-off credit card accounts. Each debt is\ndiscussed below.\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a $402 collection account for a gas bill. It stems from an\naccount that was in Applicant\u2019s name when she occupied the marital home before and\nafter the divorce. Her ex-husband moved into the home after her relocation, and he\ninformed Applicant that the account had been taken care of (Tr. 30\u201331). Her post-\nhearing exhibit shows the account is paid in full (Exhibit H). \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a $13,582 charged-off credit card account. This is\nApplicant\u2019s account and she is making monthly payments on it through a collection\nagency (Tr. 31, 36\u201338; Exhibit A). The account became delinquent when she relocated\nand was unemployed for about two months in 2006. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a $12,297 charged-off credit card account. This account\nis the responsibility of her ex-husband, and Applicant is not making payments on it (Tr.\n31). The account was made the ex-husband\u2019s responsibility in the divorce decree (Tr.\n41\u201342). She has had no collection activity on this debt. She was unable to obtain\ninformation about the account because it is in her ex-husband\u2019s name, and so the\ncreditor would not speak to her about it (Tr. 42; Exhibit D). \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a $14,994 charged-off credit card account. This is\nApplicant\u2019s account and she is making monthly payments on it through a collection\nagency (Tr. 31, 38\u201339; Exhibit A). The account became delinquent when she relocated\nand was unemployed for about two months in 2006. \nApplicant presented a written monthly budget and supplemented it with her\ntestimony (Exhibit B; Tr. 39). She has a monthly remainder of about $200 after paying\nall expenses, including the payments for the two charged-off accounts. The budget is\nfairly comprehensive and it shows she is not engaging in high living or frivolous\nspending. For example, her monthly payment for an auto loan is a modest $220.\nHer current annual salary is about $42,000 (Exhibit F). She plans to increase it\n(perhaps double it) when she completes her bachelor\u2019s degree in two years or so (Tr.\n48\u201349). She recently returned to college to improve her job qualifications and earning\npower, and she is earning high grades (Exhibit C). She is paying tuition and other\nexpenses with a Pell grant and reimbursement by her employer.  \nApplicant\u2019s overall financial condition is relatively stable, as shown by her\nmonthly budget and financial assets. She has about $3,000 in a savings account and\nabout $1,100 in a checking account (Tr. 39\u201340). In addition, she has about $7,100 in a\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

She is in good standing with her federal and state tax\nobligations, and she has had no collection activity for any accounts except for the two\ncharged-off debts she is paying off (Tr. 56\u201357). In addition, she is hopeful her income\nwill soon increase by the resumption of child-support payments (Exhibit D). When she\ncontacted the clerk of court to obtain a copy of the divorce decree, she was put in\ncontact with a person to activate child-support payments. Applicant was informed that\nshe should start receiving child support within two weeks of June 26, 2008.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.

In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. A decision to deny or revoke a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 14.\n18\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n19\n Revised Guidelines at 14. \n20\n6\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns. The most pertinent here is MC 2, which provides as follows:\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n18\n \nApplicant receives the full benefit of MC 2. Her financial problems are directly\nrelated to a combination of conditions largely beyond her control: (1) the divorce in\n2005; (2) the sudden relocation in 2006, which was followed by two months of\nunemployment; (3) new employment in 2006 at lower wages; and (4) nonpayment of\nchild support since July 2006. In addition to the conditions beyond her control, Applicant\nacted responsibly under the circumstances when she relocated to remove herself from\nan abusive and unsafe situation. Also, she demonstrated responsibility by obtaining\nemployment within a couple of months of relocating and by seeking further education to\nimprove her earning power and job qualifications.   \nAnother relevant condition is MC 4, which provides as follows:\nThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.19\nMC 4 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. The\ngas bill is paid in full, and she  initiated efforts to repay two of the charged-off credit card\naccounts (Exhibit A). She is doing so with monthly payments.\nAnd the third relevant condition is MC 5, which provides as follows:\nThe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.20\nMC 5 applies in Applicant\u2019s favor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. She credibly\nexplained why she is disputing responsibility for the charged-off credit card account. It is\nher ex-husband\u2019s account, and she was unable to obtain information on it because she\nis not an account holder (Tr. 42). Also, she provided documented proof (the divorce\ndecree) showing that her ex-husband is responsible for any credit card debt separately\nincurred by him (Exhibit E). \n\n7\nThis case presents both unfavorable and favorable evidence, which requires\nthoughtful balancing in light of the whole-person concept and the clearly-consistent\nstandard. I have considered the totality of facts and circumstances and conclude the\nfavorable evidence is more persuasive. The evidence shows that in all likelihood\nApplicant would have never experienced the financial problems but for her divorce in\n2005 followed by the sudden relocation in 2006. Her situation was made more difficult\nby unemployment for two months in 2006 and nonpayment of child support since July\n2006. Cumulatively, these circumstances had a profound effect on Applicant\u2019s overall\nfinancial condition. To her credit, she is rebuilding her life, to include her financial\nrecord, and her circumstances are improving.   \nIn addition, despite the difficult circumstances, the evidence in no way suggests\nApplicant engaged in illegal activities to generate funds, which is a concern under\nGuideline F. Instead, the evidence shows that Applicant has demonstrated fortitude in\nthe face of challenging circumstances that were largely beyond her control. Indeed,\ngiven the challenging circumstances, her overall financial condition is remarkably stable.\nAnd with sufficient time, it appears likely that Applicant will favorably resolve the\nremaining indebtedness.\nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Edmunds, Esq. \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nThis is a security clearance case in which Applicant contests the Defense\nDepartment\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for an industrial security clearance. The\naction is based on psychological conditions, security violations, and foreign influence\nsecurity concerns. The security violations and foreign influence concerns are resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. For the psychological conditions, it is undisputed that Applicant suffers\nfrom bipolar disorder, and he has been under the care of a psychiatrist since 2005.\nApplicant did not meet his burden to present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns raised by his bipolar disorder. Accordingly, as\nexplained in more detail below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nSeptember 16, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit 6.  \n2\n Exhibit 7. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on December 17, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details\nthe factual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline I for\npsychological conditions, Guideline K for handling protected information, and Guideline\nB for foreign influence. The SOR also recommended submitting the case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security-\nclearance eligibility.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 13, 2009, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to another administrative judge on April 14, 2009, and a hearing was\nscheduled for May 19, 2009. The hearing was cancelled and the case was reassigned\nto me on May 5, 2009. The hearing then took place as scheduled on June 16, 2009.\nThe hearing transcript (Tr.) was received June 24, 2009. \nProcedural Matters\nAdministrative or official notice was taken of certain facts concerning the country\nof Malaysia as set forth in Department Counsel\u2019s written request.  Also, administrative\n2\nor official notice was taken of certain facts from the DSM-IV-R.3\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, the allegations\nexcept for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.b. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old software engineer. He has worked in the defense\nindustry, initially as a government employee and then as a defense contractor, since\n1984. He has worked for the same company since 1998. His educational background\nincludes a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He is married to his second wife;\nhis first wife is deceased. He has two minor children from his current marriage.\n\n Exhibit 1.\n4\n Tr. 66.\n5\n Tr. 68.\n6\n Tr. 67. \n7\n Exhibit 5. \n8\n3\nApplicant has held a security clearance since about 1984. To retain a clearance,\nhe completed a security-clearance application in February 2007.  In doing so, he\n4\nreported, among other things, (1) his involvement in a 2006 security incident, and (2)\nthat he was under the care of a psychiatrist for bipolar disorder since 2005.\nIn addition to those matters, Applicant disclosed during the security-clearance\nprocess that his mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and nephew are citizens of Malaysia. His\nwife was born in Malaysia, and she became a U.S. citizen in 1991. His mother-in-law\nnow lives in Malaysia, she is in her 70s, and Applicant describes her as \u201ccompletely\nilliterate\u201d who has no connections to any Malaysian governmental agency.  Applicant\n5\nand his wife do not provide financial support to her. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is now\nmarried to a U.S. citizen and lives in the U.S.  His sister-in-law has no connections to\n6\nany Malaysian governmental agency. Applicant\u2019s nephew is a citizen of and a resident\nin Malaysia.  Applicant and his wife stay in contact with the nephew because he is an\n7\norphan, but their contact is limited. Applicant has not seen the nephew since 1995,\nwhen he was eight years old. The communication is typically via e-mail on birthdays and\nholidays. Applicant has no other connections with individuals in Malaysia, and he has no\nbusiness, financial, or property interests in Malaysia. \nTurning back to the 2006 security incident, the best evidence of this matter is the\ndisciplinary paperwork generated by Applicant's employer.  In summary, the employer\n8\nfound Applicant, who was the area information system security officer (ISSO), culpable\nof a security violation because he performed an unauthorized electronic download and\nsubsequently removed classified data from a secure system and area. Initially, it was\nbelieved that there was no classified data contained in the file. Later, it was determined\nthat the file did contain data that was classified. As alleged in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant, this matter involved two separate incidents. The first was when Applicant\nconnected a stand-alone unapproved PC to an approved stand-alone classified system\nwithout permission. The second was when Applicant connected an uncertified PC to a\nclassified system without permission. As a result, the employer suspended Applicant\nwithout pay for five days and warned him that any additional violations would result in\nfurther disciplinary action, to include termination. The disciplinary paperwork indicates\nno previous disciplinary actions, and the record contains no evidence of any other\nsecurity violation by Applicant. \n\n See Exhibit 7 for information on bipolar disorder. \n9\n Exhibit 4. \n10\n Exhibit 4, p. 7.\n11\n Tr. 129\u2013132.\n12\n Exhibit AA.\n13\n4\nConcerning bipolar disorder,  Applicant was first diagnosed with this condition in\n9\n2005, when he sought help and treatment from a psychiatrist. The Agency referred\nApplicant for an independent psychiatric evaluation in August 2008. The psychiatrist did\nnot appear as a witness, and so the facts below are derived from the written report.  In\n10\naddition, a curriculum vitae or resume was not attached to the report or otherwise\noffered as evidence, and so specific details about the doctor\u2019s knowledge, skill,\nexperience, training, or education in the field of psychiatry in general and in treating\nbipolar disorder are unknown. \nThe diagnosis was bipolar I mixed moderate, and the Agency\u2019s psychiatrist also\nobserved that Applicant was cutting his 500-mg medication in half and suggested\nApplicant take the medication in three 250-mg pills to obtain the full benefit from the\nmedicine. The psychiatrist opined that Applicant was not stable so long as he continued\nto cut the medicine, but this could be cured by taking the medicine properly (three 250-\nmg pills). The psychiatrist also opined that Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder (1) was not\ncausing now or in the future a significant defect in judgment or reliability, and (2) was\nnot causing now or in the future a significant defect in psychological, social, or\noccupational functioning.  The prognosis was to continue seeing his psychiatrist. \n11\nApplicant remains under the care of his psychiatrist, and he sees the doctor\nabout once every three months.  The doctor did not appear as a witness, and so the\n12\nfacts below are derived from a one-page letter, dated June 15, 2009.  The letterhead\n13\nindicates the doctor is associated with the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology,\nbut otherwise specific details about the doctor\u2019s knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\neducation in the field of psychiatry in general and in treating bipolar disorder are\nunknown; again, a curriculum vitae or resume was not attached to the letter or\notherwise offered as evidence. The psychiatrist\u2019s letter is addressed to whom it may\nconcern and consists of five sentences in two paragraphs as follows: \nI have been following [Applicant] since June 10, 2005, for a diagnosis of\nBipolar disorder. His current medication is [medicine] 750 mg daily and his\nmost recent [medicine] level was 57 on February 11, 2009. \nMy last appointment with [Applicant] was on May 1, 2009, and he was\ndoing very well, with overall mood, sleep and thought processes. He has\n\n Exhibit AA. \n14\n Tr. 85.\n15\n Tr. 89.\n16\n Tr. 130.\n17\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n18\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n20\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Currently, his prognosis is good.  \n14\nApplicant has been on the three 250-mg pills daily regimen since about October\n2008.  He has taken the medication consistently without exception.  Applicant\n15\n16\nunderstands that the course of his treatment will be staying on bipolar medication for the\nrest of his life.  \n17\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n18\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n19\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n20\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n21\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n22\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n23\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n24\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n25\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n26\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n27\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n28\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, and 8 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n29\nconditions). \n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n23\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n24\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n25\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.26\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.27\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n28\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nThe gravamen of this case is whether Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information is questioned or put into doubt due to his ongoing mental-health\ncondition of bipolar disorder. But before addressing that issue, it is necessary to\naddress the other guidelines set forth in the SOR.\nConcerning foreign influence under Guideline B,  Applicant does have family\n29\nties, via his marriage, to Malaysia that fall within the scope of the guideline as potentially\ndisqualifying matters. But based on this record, coupled with Applicant\u2019s longstanding\nties and faithful service to the U.S., his family ties to Malaysia are rather bland and\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34, and 35 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n30\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28, and 29 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n31\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 27. \n32\n7\nbenign and do not create a heightened risk of exploitation due to foreign influence.\nAccordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.\nConcerning handling protected information under Guideline K,  Applicant\u2019s\n30\nsecurity incident in October 2006, which was based on two separate incidents, falls\nwithin the scope of the guideline as potentially disqualifying matters. The record shows\nthis was a serious matter as reflected by the employer-imposed punishment. The record\nalso shows Applicant is no longer serving as the ISSO, he has a favorable (if not hyper-\nsensitive) attitude toward security responsibilities, and there are no other similar\nincidents in his background. Taken together, these two security violations in the same\nmonth during a 25-year career in the defense industry are not so singularly egregious\nthat Applicant should be disqualified on this basis. Accordingly, Guideline K is decided\nfor Applicant.\nUnder Guideline I,  the suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into\n31\ndoubt due to an applicant\u2019s psychological conditions. The overall concern under the\nguideline is that:\nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is\nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified\nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist)\nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government,\nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference\nconcerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of seeking mental health counseling.32\nThe guideline provides for three conditions that could raise security concerns and\nmay be disqualifying. The three conditions are as follows:\nBehavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but\nnot limited to emotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent,\nparanoid, or bizarre behavior;\nAn opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual\nhas a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 28 (a) \u2013 (c).\n33\n Exhibit 4. \n34\n Exhibit 4. \n35\n8\nThe individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a diagnosed\nemotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take prescribed\nmedication.33\nIn SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, the Agency alleged and Applicant admitted behavior that\nappears somewhat odd or strange. Because Applicant admitted the behavior, it was not\naddressed in detail in the findings of fact. It was not alleged in the SOR, but it was\ncertainly implied or suggested by the Agency\u2019s case at hearing that the behavior was a\nmanifestation of or related to Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder. The record does not persuade\nme that is the case despite that the behavior in question was odd or strange. The\nAgency\u2019s psychiatrist did not address this behavior in the evaluation.  And no other\n34\nevidence (for example, expert witness testimony) was produced to show that the\nbehavior in question was a manifestation of or related to Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder,\nand I cannot assume it to be the case. Accordingly, on this basis, the first DC\nconcerning paranoid or bizarre behavior does not apply against Applicant. \nBut both the second and third DC apply against Applicant. They apply because,\nas I read the evaluation in its entirety, the Agency\u2019s psychiatrist found Applicant was\nunstable in August 2008 due to cutting his prescribed medication.  Given these\n35\ncircumstances, \nsecurity \nconcerns \nabout \nApplicant\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \nor\ntrustworthiness are justified. \nThe guideline also provides the certain facts and circumstances may mitigate\nsecurity concerns. The five mitigating conditions under the guideline are:\nThe identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the\ntreatment plan;\nThe individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program\nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently\nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly\nqualified mental health professional;\nRecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed\nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an\nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a\nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 29 (a) \u2013 (e). \n36\n Exhibit AA. \n37\n Tr. 16. \n38\n See Fed. R. Evid. 703 (Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts). \n39\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2 (a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n40\n9\nThe past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one caused\nby death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been resolved, and\nthe individual no longer shows indications of emotional instability; and\nThere is no indication of a current problem.36\nThe record supports application of the first, second, and third mitigating\nconditions in Applicant\u2019s favor. Based on this record, however, I am not persuaded that\nApplicant\u2019s condition of bipolar disorder is wholly mitigated and no longer an ongoing\nsecurity concern. What is missing here is persuasive and convincing evidence that\nApplicant\u2019s condition is under control and will remain so for the foreseeable future. \nIn \nhis \nopening \nstatement, \nApplicant\u2019s \nCounsel \ndescribed \nApplicant\u2019s\npsychiatrist\u2019s letter  as \u201cthe most cogent exhibit\u201d for the Guideline I issues.  That would\n37\n38\nbe the case had the letter contained enough detail and context to be helpful. As written,\nit is of little value and receives limited weight. Besides its lack of comprehensiveness,\nthe key defect is that\u2014although the  psychiatrist opined that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was\ngood\u2014I have no idea why the psychiatrist came to that opinion because the letter does\nnot provide the bases of the opinion.  The facts or data that the psychiatrist relied upon\n39\nmay have provided the context for the prognosis. Also, it may have demonstrated that\nthe prognosis was thoughtful, reasonable, and valid, which is the type of prognosis a\nclearance decision may be based upon. This type of evidence is typically provided\nthrough expert witness testimony or a comprehensive report or both. The five-sentence\nletter raises as many questions as it appears to answer. And given the clearly-\nconsistent standard, coupled with Applicant\u2019s chronic condition, the five-sentence letter\nis not sufficient evidence to satisfy Applicant\u2019s burden. Accordingly, Guideline I is\ndecided against Applicant. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to\nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence, to include the character witness and Exhibits A\u2013AA, and\nI also considered the nine-factor whole-person concept.  Although much of this\n40\ninformation is helpful to Applicant, it is insufficient to meet his burden.\n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline I. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline K:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline B:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. DOHA subsequently issued to Applicant an\nundated Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which have raised security\nApril 30, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nconcerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F\n2\n(financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 1, 2008, and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On February 9, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision.\n3\nApplicant received the FORM on February 29, 2009, and was given 30 days to file a\nresponse to the FORM. She did not submit any additional information and the case was\nassigned to me on April 27, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $28,485 for 14 delinquent\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.n. Additionally, the government alleged Applicant\u2019s\nmonthly expenses exceed her income. (SOR \u00b6 1.o) It was also alleged that Applicant\ndeliberately made false statements to the government when she answered \u201cno\u201d to SF\n85P questions 22.a (bankruptcy, judgments, tax liens) and 22.b (loans or financial\nobligations more than 180 days past due), thereby omitting all mention of any financial\nproblems from her questionnaire. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, respectively) She admitted all of\nthe SOR \u00b6 1 allegations, but denied both of the SOR \u00b6 2 allegations. In addition to the\nfacts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant\nfact.\nApplicant is 27 years old. Since October 2006, she has worked as an\nappointment specialist for a health care and medical insurance company contracted to\nmanage medical insurance claims and information for TRICARE, the Department of\nDefense (DoD) medical insurance system for military personnel and their families. Her\njob requires a trustworthiness determination to ensure she may be entrusted with\nsensitive personal, medical, and financial information of military members and their\ndependents. The required background investigation produced a credit report that\nattributed to her 14 unpaid debts and judgments, which include delinquent personal\nloans, credit cards, retail accounts, and insurance premiums. Her debts also include\nunpaid rent obligations and at least one car repossession. None of the debts alleged in\nthe SOR have been paid or otherwise resolved. (FORM, Item 7)\nBefore issuing the SOR in this case, DOHA adjudicators asked Applicant to\nupdate the information in her background investigation by responding to interrogatories.\nIn response, Applicant asserted only that she may file bankruptcy at some point and\nthat she only has enough money each month to cover her current obligations. However,\nshe offered no information about the cause of her debts or to show she has taken any\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\naction to resolve her financial problems. (FORM, Item 5) As to the allegation that\nApplicant\u2019s monthly expenses exceed her income, she admits the allegation. However,\nthe FORM does not present any information that would serve as the basis for that\nallegation. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SF 85P, she did not list any of the debts,\njudgments, liens or repossessions in her background. She has denied deliberately\nomitting information about her debts, stating in response to question 8 of the DOHA\ninterrogatories, only that she was \u201cunaware of all debt.\u201d (FORM, Item 5) \nPolicies\nEach public trust decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to sensitive\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - financial considerations) and AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E- personal\nconduct).\nA public trust decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to\n5\nsensitive information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible\ninformation on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke an applicant\u2019s\npublic trust position. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\napplicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a\n\u201cright\u201d to a public trust position, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A\n6\nperson who has access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR and the government\u2019s information\npresented through the FORM are sufficient to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\n1.o. The facts established require application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations). The burden thus shifted to Applicant to present reliable\ninformation sufficient to refute, extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by the\ngovernment\u2019s information. In response, Applicant did not present any such information.\nNothing in this record supports application of any of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\n20. Accordingly, she has failed to mitigate the government\u2019s adverse information about\nher finances. \nPersonal Conduct.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support, despite Applicant\u2019s\ndenials, the allegations that she deliberately falsified her responses to two SF 85P\nquestions about her finances. Available information raises security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct as addressed in AG\u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n5\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nApplicants are required to provide truthful answers at all times during the\ninvestigative and adjudicative process. Withholding relevant information about one\u2019s\nbackground can potentially impede the government\u2019s ability to make an accurate\ndecision about granting access to sensitive information. Applicant claims she was\n\u201cunaware of all debt.\u201d This is simply untenable. The only reasonable conclusion that can\nbe drawn from the available information probative of this issue is that she deliberately\nlied when she completed the form. Even if she were not aware of ALL of her debts, she\nsurely knew one of her cars had been repossessed and/or that there were collection\nagencies trying to collect one or more of her delinquent debts. These facts and\ncircumstances require application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities). In response, Applicant has not provided any explanation for her\nanswers. On balance, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nabout her lack of candor about her finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and F. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 27 years\nold and presumed to be a mature adult. According to her SF 85P, she has been steadily\nemployed since November 2004. Apart from that, there is no information that might\nsupport application of any of the whole person factors. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances and truthfulness\n8\nshows she has failed to address satisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about her ability\nor willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests as her own. Because protection of\nthe national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be\nresolved in favor of the government.9\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a position of trust.

Campbell, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 20, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP), on\na January 26, 2007.  On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 17, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on June 25, 2008.  The case was transferred to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on July 7, 2008.   A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 8, 2008, scheduling the hearing for August 6, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented five exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5.  The Applicant\npresented one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.  He also  testified on his own\nbehalf.  The official transcript (Trs.) was received on August 12, 2008.\n\n2\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the California\nFamily Code Section 308 includes the validity of foreign marriages and the definition of\ncommon law marriage.  The Applicant had no objection.  (Tr. p. 49).  The request and\nthe attached document was not admitted into evidence but was included in the record.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 60 years old, married, and has an\nAssociate degree in psychology, photography and music.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as a Security Guard and is seeking to maintain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant has lived with his mother since 1959, except for a short time when\nhe had an apartment, and during his short Army career from August 67 to March 68 for\nwhich he received an honorable discharge.  In 1990, he began working for his current\nemployer and has been assigned to a number of different posts.  He applied for a\nsecurity clearance and has been in an interim status since then.  Except for the incident\ndescribed below, the Applicant has never committed any security violations of any type\nand he has no criminal record.  \nAbout five years ago, the Applicant met a widower in a store that he befriended\nand later started dating.  Over time, the Applicant developed an intimate relationship\nwith her.  Eventually he began supporting her financially, by depositing $500.00 a month\ninto her bank account to cover her mortgage.  He lived with her as much as he was able\nto, and they represented to people that they were married.  \nIn January 2005, without ill intentions, the Applicant applied for medical benefits\nfor his girlfriend through his employer, by enrolling her as his spouse.  The Applicant\ntestified that he believed that he had entered into a common law marriage with his\ngirlfriend and based on that, thought that she was eligible for medical coverage under\nhis insurance.  It was also about this time that the Applicant discovered that his\ngirlfriend\u2019s breast cancer had returned, and had metastasized to her lungs, liver and\npancreas.  She discussed with the Applicant the fact that she needed medical coverage\nthat would provide chemotherapy treatment.              \n\n3\n     \nOn October 5, 2008, the Applicant\u2019s company informed him that his girlfriend\u2019s\ninsurance coverage was not valid.  She could not receive medical insurance through the\ncompany as his spouse because common law marriage was not recognized and they\nwere not legally married.  The very next day, on October 6, 2008, the Applicant and his\ngirlfriend were married in a civil ceremony at the County Clerk\u2019s Office.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A).  She is now properly receiving medical benefits under the Applicant\u2019s\ninsurance.   \nAn adverse information report dated November 7, 2006, concerning the Applicant\nwas written up by a manager, who is no longer employed at the company.  The report\nstates that the Applicant fraudulently enrolled his girlfriend in his medical benefits,\nclaiming her as his spouse.  An e-mail dated November 6, 2006, from the benefits\nmanager at the time, states that the Applicant knew that he could not enroll his\ngirlfriend.  (Government Exhibit 2).  \nAlthough he does not remember signing it, on October 30, 2006, the Applicant\nreceived a notice of counseling concerning a violation of company rules for enrolling his\ngirlfriend on his medical plan by claiming she was his spouse.  (See Government Exhibit\n5).   \nThe Applicant explained that although he and his wife are now legally married,\nthey still maintain separate residences.  The Applicant still lives with his mother, who\nrecently broke her hip and needs him to care for her.  His wife lives in her house.\nNothing has changed between the Applicant and his now wife except the fact that they\nare now legally married.  \nThe California Family Code Section 308 which includes the validity of foreign\nmarriages and the definition of common law marriage infers that the common law\nmarriage, as it is widely known is not recognized in the state. \n  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\n\n4\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities;\n16.(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, security officials, or other official representatives in connection\nwith a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.    \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n17. (e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\n\n5\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in dishonesty that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in dishonesty (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline E of the SOR.\nThe Government contends that the Applicant fraudulently enrolled his girlfriend\non his vision, medical and dental benefit plan by claiming that she was his wife.  The\nevidence is not convincing.  Under the circumstances, it is obvious that the Applicant is\nunsophisticated, naive and innocent concerning the ways of the world.  I find that he\nhonestly believed that his girlfriend was his common law spouse and that she could be\neligible for medical benefits under his insurance.  The Applicant\u2019s belief was wrong, but\nwas made in good faith.  The only evidence to the contrary is an e-mail from an\nindividual who no longer works for the company that informs the Applicant of the fraud.\nThe Applicant contends that he never received the e-mail and there is no evidence to\nprove that he did.             \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\n\n6\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities and 16.(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination\napply.  However Mitigating Condition 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to\nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress also applies.   \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, do not\nsupport a whole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nHere, the Applicant is a sixty year old man who has lived with his mother almost\nhis entire life.  For the past five years, he has had a girlfriend who has served as a wife\nto him.  In fact, his girlfriend was the closest thing to a wife he has ever known.  He\nprovided her with financial and emotional support and felt responsible to take care of\nher medical needs.  He believed that he had a common law marriage with her.  Based\nupon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant did not fraudulently enroll his\ngirlfriend on his vision, medical and dental benefit plan but was under the misconception\nthat she was his common law wife and that she was eligible for the benefits.  When he\nlearned that she was not eligible for benefits because they were not legally married, he\nimmediately married her.  She is now rightfully receiving medical benefits under his\ninsurance.      \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On May 30, 2008, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge found as follows: Applicant is a 34-year-old radar technician for a defense\ncontractor working in South America.  He has been employed in this capacity and location by\ndefense contractors since January 2001.  He previously served in the United States Maine Corps for\nover five years in a similar occupation specialty.  He held a security clearance for most of the time\nhe was on active duty. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Colombia.\nApplicant\u2019s child is a dual citizen of Colombia and the United States, and resides with her parents\nin Colombia.  She is a citizen of the United States because she was born of a United States citizen\nliving abroad.\n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is an officer in the Colombian military.  She has an approved resignation\nfrom the Colombian military.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor notes that he knows Applicant\u2019s wife and has\nno negative information concerning her.  He has no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United\nStates. The military mission chief overseeing Applicant\u2019s work has known Applicant\u2019s wife for over\ntwo years and worked several projects with her.  He stated that she is a trusted officer of good\ncharacter.  She is highly respected by her peers and leaders, and he has full trust and confidence in\nher.  He has no concerns about Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Applicant presented no\ninformation concerning his mother-in-law and father-in-law, except his admission that they are\nresidents and citizens of Colombia.\nColombia is a constitutional democracy with the second largest population in South America.\nThe government generally respects freedom of speech and press, freedom of assembly and\nassociation, and freedom of religion.  The government has improved its respect for human rights,\nalthough serious problems remain.  There were unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced\ndisappearances, insubordinate military collaboration with criminal groups, and other human rights\nabuses.  Government steps to improve human rights and the security situation showed demonstrated\nresults.\nIllegal armed groups committed the majority of human rights violations in the country,\nincluding political killings, kidnaping, and torture.  Colombian-based terrorists groups were\nweakened as a result of aggressive actions by Colombian military and police but the groups continue\n\nDecision at 6.\n1\n3\nto murder, kidnap, and terrorize Colombians from all walks of life.  The United States State\nDepartment notes that travel to Colombia can expose visitors to considerable risk.  There are at least\nthree recognized foreign terrorist organizations operating in Colombia.  These groups have carried\nout bombings and other attacks in and around major urban areas, including against civilian targets.\nKidnaping and murders of journalists, missionaries, scientists, human rights workers, business\npeople, tourists, and even small children have taken place.  No one can be considered safe from such\nactions.  The United States Embassy restricts official and personal travel of its employees outside\nof urban areas. \n \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed based on his good\ncharacter and job performance, his ties to the United States, and the fact that his wife has resigned\nfrom the Colombian military.  Applicant\u2019s arguments in that regard do not demonstrate that the\nJudge erred.\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant attaches new evidence in the form of a sworn statement,\ntravel documentation, and a document from a Colombian military department.  The Board cannot\nconsider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00434 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 18, 2008).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On November 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns for foreign influence under Guideline B. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 27, 2007.  He admitted the \nfactual allegations in the SOR.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing.  Department counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on February 20, 2008.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material \n(FORM) on March 14, 2008, and was provided the opportunity to file objections, and \n \n1 \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant \ntimely submitted additional information in an undated letter received by DOHA on April \n28, 2008.  Department Counsel had no objection to consideration of the additional \nmaterial.  The case was assigned to me on May 9, 2008.  Based on a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel in the FORM asked that administrative notice be taken of \ncertain facts concerning Colombia.  I have considered the request and the documents \nprovided by Department Counsel.  Administrative notice is taken of the facts as noted \nbelow in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old radar technician for a defense contractor working at \nremote locations in South America.  He has been employed in this capacity and location \nby defense contractors since January 2001.  He previously served in the United States \nMarine Corps for over five years in a similar occupation specialty.  He held a security \nclearance for most of the time he was on active duty. (Item 4, e-QIP, dated January 8, \n2006) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nColombia.  Applicant\u2019s daughter, born in Colombia in 2004, is a dual citizen of Colombia \nand the United States, and resides with her parents in Colombia.  She is a citizen of the \nUnited States because she was born of a United States citizen living abroad. (See, \nCitizen Certificate, Answer to FORM) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is an officer in the Colombian Air Force serving as an architect.  \nApplicant met his wife while she was assigned as a base facilities engineer. (Item 5, \nReport of Investigation, dated February 26, 2007).  Applicant\u2019s wife has an approved \nresignation from the Colombian Air Force. (See, Applicant\u2019s response to FORM)  \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor notes that he knows Applicant\u2019s wife and has no negative \ninformation concerning her.  He has no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United \nStates.  The Air Force mission chief overseeing Applicant\u2019s work has known Applicant\u2019s \nwife for over two years and worked several projects with her.  He states she is a trusted \nofficer and her character and morale (sic) are solid.  She is highly respected by her \npeers and leaders.  He has full trust and confidence in her.  He has no concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. (Item 3, Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR, Letters \ndated December 26 and December 27, 2007)  Applicant presented no information \nconcerning his mother-in-law and father-in-law, except his admission that they are \nresidents and citizens of Colombia. \n \n \nColombia is a constitutional democracy with the second largest population in \nSouth America.  The government generally respects freedom of speech and press, \nfreedom of assembly and association, and freedom of religion.  The government has \n\n \n3 \n \n \nimproved its respect for human rights, although serious problems remain.  There were \nunlawful and extra-judicial killings, forced disappearances, insubordinate military \ncollaboration with criminal groups, and other human rights abuses.  Government steps \nto improve human rights and the security situation showed demonstrated results.   \n \n \nIllegal armed groups committed the majority of human rights violations, to include \npolitical killings and kidnappings, force disappearances, and torture.  Colombian based \nterrorists groups were weakened as a result of aggressive actions by Colombian military \nand police but the groups continue to murder, kidnap, and terrorize Colombians from all \nwalks of life.  The United States State Department notes that travel to Colombia can \nexpose visitors to considerable risk.  There are at least three recognized foreign terrorist \norganizations operating in Colombia.  These groups have carried out bombings and \nother attacks in and around major urban areas, including against civilian targets.  \nKidnappings and murders of journalists, missionaries, scientists, human rights workers, \nbusiness people, tourists, and even small children have taken place.  No one can be \nconsidered safe from such actions.  The United States Embassy restricts official and \npersonal travel of its employees outside of urban areas.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThere is a security concern because foreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interests.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity \nof the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is location, \nincluding but not limited to, such consideration as whether the foreign country is known \nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant lives in Colombia with his wife and daughter who are citizens and \nresidents of Colombia.  Since Applicant\u2019s wife, daughter, and in-laws live in Colombia, it \nis reasonable to assume that there is contact between Applicant and his mother-in-law \nand father-in-law who are citizens and residents of Colombia.  It is unreasonable to \nbelieve that his in-laws would not visit their daughter and granddaughter.  These \ncontacts raise security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 \n7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates \na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion); and AG \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information).  AG \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living \nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) is \nraised because Applicant lives with his wife and daughter, who are residents and \ncitizens of Colombia.  The heightened risk in Colombia is created by the actions of the \nterrorist groups in Colombia. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe nature of the country in which persons are located is an issue.  Security \nconcerns can be raised from countries both friendly and hostile to the United States.  It \ncan also be raised because of unlawful or terrorists groups that are active in the \ncountry.  The United States has an interest in protecting its classified information \nwhether the person, organization, or country seeking the information has interests \ninimical to the United States. (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) \nFriendly countries can have disagreements with the United States over matters that are \nvital to the national security of the United States.  Friendly countries have engaged in \nespionage against the United States while seeking economic, scientific, and technical \ninformation (ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. May 29, 2002)).  The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, its human rights record, and \nthe actions and activities of groups operating in the country are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government \ncoercion.  The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the \nforeign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is dependent on or \nassociated with the government, or there are groups known to operate in the country \nand have or will target individual\u2019s to gain intelligence, or other advantages.  While the \ngovernment of Colombia is friendly to the United States and has improved its human \nrights record, the terrorist groups that operate in Colombia create a significant threat \nthat raises security concerns.  Because of these groups, Applicant has a heavy burden \nto establish that his contacts with his wife, daughter, and in-laws do not create a \nsecurity concern. \n \n \nApplicant is living with his wife and daughter in Colombia.  It is assumed that he \nhas frequent and non-casual contact with his in-laws.  He has not raised Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication with foreign \ncitizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could created a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation) because his contact with foreign citizens is frequent \nand personal.   \n \n \nThe only information presented by Applicant is that his wife is resigning her \ncommission with the Colombian Air Force and the evaluation of his supervisor and the \nmission chief that he is a loyal United States citizen.  He has not presented any \ninformation concerning the status of his in-laws or why his in-laws, wife, and daughter \nwould not be vulnerable to exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion \nby the terrorist groups.  He has not presented information to establish that his \nconnection to his family and in-laws in Colombia and the heightened risk created by \nterrorist groups will not create a conflict between his obligation to protect classified \ninformation and his desire to protect his family.  He has not presented sufficient \ninformation to raise Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the \nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or \nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of the U.S.); and \nAG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest)  He has failed to meet his heavy burden that his contacts with foreign citizens \nand residents do not create a security concern.  \n \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant served in the United States Marine Corps for over five years, \nsuccessfully held a security clearance, and received favorable evaluations of security \nworthiness from his supervisor and the United State Air Force Chief of Mission.  I \nconsidered the security situation in Colombia created by terrorist groups and Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to present information that his contacts with his foreign resident and citizen family \nmembers do not create a security concern.  Access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owes the Social Security Administration about $50,000 of the $62,594\nin benefit payments she was not entitled to receive. She also owes more than $11,000\nin delinquent state and federal taxes on those funds. She is repaying these debts at\nabout $600 per month. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted her electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on June 16, 2006. On April 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n1\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\nOctober 10, 2008\n\nItem 2.\n2\nThe government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4.\n4\nItem 2.\n5\nItem 7 at 8.\n6\n2\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 7, 2008, and requested that her\ncase be decided by an Administrative Judge on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 22, 2008. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nshe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her\ncopy of the FORM on August 5, 2008, and returned it to DOHA. She provided no further\nresponse to the FORM within the 30-day period she was given to do so, did not request\nadditional time to respond, and made no objection to consideration of any evidence\nsubmitted by Department Counsel. I received the case assignment on September 26,\n2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She served a three-\nyear enlistment in the Navy from 1991 to 1994, and has held a security clearance since\nMay 2001. She is single with no children, and has worked for her current employer\nsince 1996. She attended college classes from 1999 through 2005 part-time, and\nintends to complete her bachelor\u2019s degree.4\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the truth of the factual allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c.  Sometime around 2000 she underwent surgery and\n5\ntreatment for cancer, causing her to miss work for about a year. She received worker\u2019s\ncompensation payments during this time, and had medical insurance coverage. While\nshe was not working, she applied for and was granted social security benefit payments\nof about $1,000 per month. She notified her local Social Security Administration (SSA)\noffice when she returned to work, and was told that benefit payments would continue\n\u201cfor a period.\u201d She failed to follow up thereafter, and continued receiving benefit\npayments to which she was not entitled for about four years. She spent all of this money\n\u201cfoolishly on clothing and eating out.\u201d  Her total debt to the SSA was $62,594 in 2006,\n6\nwhen the SSA discovered the improper payments and sought repayment through a\n$400 per month wage garnishment action. The Government has also retained her\nincome tax refunds and applied them toward this debt. She makes no other payments\ntoward this debt, and estimates it will take about 10 years to repay it in full.  \n\nItem 5 at 6.\n7\nItem 6 at 2.\n8\nItem 8 at 1.\n9\nItem 7 at 8. \n10\n3\nIn July 2006, the outstanding balance on this debt was $62,384.   By August\n7\n2007, it was down to $56,222.  In July 2008, the balance due was reported as \u201c50K\u201d on\n8\nher credit report.  At $400 per month from the previously reported balance, this rounded\n9\namount would actually be $51,422, but the government has also been applying income\ntax refunds to this debt. In the absence of more accurate record evidence, the actual\nbalance will be considered slightly less than $50,000 at present.\nApplicant filed state and federal tax returns for the years 2002 through 2006,\nreflecting receipt of the unauthorized SSA benefits, and owes approximately $11,000 to\n$12,000 in unpaid taxes on that income. She has reached an agreement to pay the IRS\n$200 monthly, but offered no evidence of a plan to pay her state taxes.  At this\n10\npayment rate it will be four to five years before the delinquent taxes are paid. Applicant\noffered no other evidence concerning her character, trustworthiness or responsibility. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 19(d) makes, \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as\nembezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account\nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust,\u201d\na disqualifying condition. Finally, AG \u00b6 19(e) addresses security concerns raised by,\n\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other\nfinancial analysis.\u201d Applicant accumulated more than $73,000 in debt to the federal and\nstate governments through knowingly continuing to receive SSA benefits, to which she\nwas not entitled, for about four years. She spent all of that money \u201cfoolishly,\u201d and is\nunable repay these debts for many years. The evidence is sufficient to raise all four of\n\n5\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination and balancing\nof resulting security concerns with any potentially mitigating matters.\nDepartment Counsel also asserted that the disqualifying condition set forth in AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 19(b) is supported by this record. Except to the extent that this disqualifying\ncondition\u2019s \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending\u201d element overlaps with AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(e)\nconcerning \u201cspending beyond one\u2019s means,\u201d there is no record evidence supporting its\nindependent application. She is repaying her debts through wage garnishment and an\nIRS agreement, so the required \u201cabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to repay the debt,\u201d is not established.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nissues have been a continuing problem since at least 2002. Her inability to meet these\nfinancial obligations is ongoing, and continues to raise concerns about her current\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The evidence does not support this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant has been\nregularly employed, except for the period she underwent cancer treatment, for twelve\nyears. She received worker\u2019s compensation and proper SSA benefit payments during\nthat period, and her medical insurance covered most of her treatment costs. The debts\nof concern did not arise from her medical treatment, but rather from her continuing to\nreceive and spend SSA benefit payments to which she was no longer entitled after her\nreturn to work. She provided no evidence indicating that these debts arose due to\nmatters beyond her control, or that she acted responsibly to end the unauthorized\npayments or pay the taxes on them.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). This mitigating condition is partly raised by\nApplicant\u2019s repayment arrangements, but is not supported as a factor for significant\nconsideration in this case because of the involuntary nature of the wage garnishment.\nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant initiated a\npayment agreement with the IRS to resolve her delinquent federal income tax debts.\nHowever, she neither initiated the SSA wage garnishment collection action nor offered\nany evidence that she did anything to end the improper benefit payments that she\naccepted and spent for four years. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition has\nnot been established.\n\n6\nOn balance, the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial conduct\noutweigh any mitigation in the record evidence. She knowingly obtained and spent more\nthan $62,000 in SSA benefits to which she was not entitled. Her resulting significant\nindebtedness is unlikely to be resolved for ten more years.  Her inability or unwillingness\nto make any payments toward this debt except through mandatory wage garnishment\nsupports the inference that she remains financially overextended and, therefore, at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Her history and pattern of financial\nirresponsibility further indicate a lack of judgment and unwillingness to abide by rules\nand \nregulations, \nthereby \nraising \nsubstantial \nquestions \nabout \nher \nreliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for her choices and conduct. She did not show that her debts arose from\nunusual medical circumstances, or other circumstances largely beyond her control.\nApplicant incurred these debts by collecting and spending SSA benefits to which she\nwas not entitled. Applicant submitted no evidence of rehabilitation or permanent\nbehavioral change, or demonstrating that risk of coercion or duress is not ongoing. Her\ndisregard of lawful obligations creates continuing doubt about her trustworthiness and\nreliability. She offered no other evidence about her character or responsibility to mitigate\nthese concerns, or tending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Hoffman, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: George A. Pivivar, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant last used marijuana two weeks after completing graduate school. His \nlast use occurred more than a year ago. After a thorough review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I conclude Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the \ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 16, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 3, 2008, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement. \n \n \nOn January 15, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On March 5, 2008, I was assigned the case. On April \n14, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on April 23, \n2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through D, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. On May 9, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR, \nwith explanations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old scientific programmer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since May 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. His supervisor \nbelieves Applicant is a very good worker, a self starter, a good learner, interested in his \njob, and as a new employee is doing quite well. (Tr. 124, 131) Applicant is frank, honest, \nand likable. His work performance was rated mainly as having \u201cfully met\u201d the objectives \nand requirements of the job, with one rating of \u201cconsistently exceeded\u201d the requirements \nof the job. (Ex. C and D) \n \n \nApplicant was a casual user of marijuana in high school and college. (Answer to \nSOR) His first use was in 1997 at the age of 15. (Ex B, Tr. 49) From 2000 through May \n2005, when he graduated from college, he smoked marijuana two or three times a \nweek. (Ex. 2) Following college, from August 2005 to June 2007, he used marijuana \nfour or five times a year. Applicant told his counselor he had used marijuana three to \nfour times a week from age 18 to 20 and from age 20 to 22, he used it once a week. His \nreduction in marijuana usage occurred after he started dating the woman who became \nhis wife.  \n \nHis last use occurred in June 2007, shortly after he completed his security \nclearance application, Standard Form (SF) 86, dated May 17, 2007. (Ex. 1) The usage \noccurred a couple of weeks after obtaining his Master\u2019s degree and a couple of weeks \nbefore his marriage. (Ex. 2) His most recent use prior to June 2007, occurred in \nFebruary 2007, with his friends during Mardi Gras weekend. (Tr. 35,36) \n \nIn June 2007, a friend of his wife came to Applicant\u2019s and his wife home, \naccompanied by a male friend. Applicant smoked marijuana with his guests. (Tr. 78) A \nfew days later, Applicant noticed his guests had left the marijuana pipe with some \nmarijuana in it. (Tr. 79) Knowing he was about to get married, Applicant saw this as his \nlast opportunity to smoke marijuana and lit the pipe. (Tr. 79)  \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant married, which was a life-changing event. He values his \ntime with his wife. His wife has completed medical school and is doing her residency. \n\n \n \n \n3\nShe is a focused and disciplined person. His wife has expressed her dislike for \nmarijuana use. (Tr. 33)  \n \n \nApplicant was president of his high school senior class. As an honor student, he \ngraduated near the top of his class. Applicant\u2019s father believes Applicant is a leader, \nhard working, forthright, humble, honest to a fault, active in school, driven to do the best \nhe could, and follows through on what he says. (Tr. 92, 97, 108) Applicant has always \nbeen goal-driven, motivated, and disciplined. He is very serious about his first full-time \njob. (Tr. 116) With his marriage, his father sees Applicant as more mature and \ndisciplined who learns from his mistakes. (Tr. 118) \n \nIn college, Applicant received a senior achievement award for academic \nachievement. (Tr. 26) During college he spent 15 hours per week involved with the \ncampus ministry. (Tr. 26) In 2005, he graduated from college with a bachelor of science \ndegree and a 3.7 GPA. In 2007, he received a master of science degree with a 4.0 \nGPA. (Ex A) \n \n \nApplicant no longer sees old friends who he associated with and with whom he \nsmoked marijuana. He describes them as still single and \u201ckind of having trouble moving \npast that part of their lives.\u201d (Tr. 40) He now spends most of his time with his wife and \ncouples they know. He now has his first full time job. He now sees himself and his wife \nas more spiritual. He had fallen away from the faith in which he grew up. He occupies \nhis free time with his house and dogs.   \n \n \nApplicant intends to never smoke marijuana again. (Tr. 38) At Christmas time \n2007, he was offered marijuana, but turned it down. Applicant is willing to sign any type \nof automatic revocation agreement whereby his employment would end should he test \npositive for any illegal drug. (Tr. 42)  \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant had a chemical dependency evaluation. (Ex. B) Applicant \nwas diagnosed as having a low probability of having a substance dependence disorder \nwith chemicals and therapeutic intervention was not justified. (Ex. B)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n \n \n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement  \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 24) AG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Applicant smoked marijuana in high school, \ncollege, and grad school. His last usage was in June 2007. AG \u00b6 25a \u201cany drug abuse\u201d \napplies.  \n \nApplicant last marijuana use occurred after he had started working for his present \njob and after he had submitted his security questionnaire. However, AG \u00b6 25g \u201cany \nillegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d does not apply because a \nclearance had not been granted.  \n\n \n \n \n5\n \nAG \u00b6 26 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Applicant first \nused marijuana in high school. The first two years of college he used marijuana two or \nthree times a week. During the second two years, after he met and starting dating the \nwoman he would marry, his usage was once a week. After college, during graduate \nschool, his usage was four or five times a year. He used it in February 2007 with friends \nduring Mardi Gras weekend. He saw his last use in June 2007 as his last opportunity to \nuse marijuana because he had just completed graduate school, was within two weeks \nof marrying, and had just started his first full-time job.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 (a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has some \napplicability. The last use was recent, however, his usage during the last two year was \ninfrequent. His usage occurred while he was a student, except for the last usage \noccurring two weeks after graduation. Applicant\u2019s marriage, change of associates, \nstated intent never to use again, and full-time employment indicate it is unlikely he will \nuse again.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26b \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d applies. \nHe has stated he will not use marijuana again and it has been a year since his last use. \nHe no longer associates with his high school associates and sees his college friends \ninfrequently. AG \u00b6 26b (1) \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d \napplies.  \n \nApplicant is no longer in college. His wife is completing her medical residency \nand they associate with other married couples who are also completing their \nresidencies. AG \u00b6 26b (2) \u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused,\u201d applies. Applicant has stated a desire to sign a statement of automatic revocation \nof clearance for any future use, but has not done so. Therefore, AG \u00b6 26b (4) \u201ca signed \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation,\u201d does not \napply.  \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant had a chemical dependency evaluation and was \ndiagnosed as having a low probability of having a substance dependence disorder with \nchemicals. Therapeutic intervention was not justified. AG \u00b6 26 (d) \u201csatisfactory \ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional,\u201d does not apply because there was \nno treatment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n \n \n \n6\n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is relatively young, \ncurrently age 25. Since May 2007, he has undergone life-changing events. He graduate \nfrom grad school, obtained his first full-time job, and got married. Each event having a \nmaturing effect on Applicant. He spends his time with his wife, their dogs, and working \non the house. He no longer associates with his college friends, but now associates with \nmarried couples and his wife\u2019s friends who are completing their medical residencies. \n \n \nApplicant is a bright, intelligent person. He did well academically in high school, \ncollege, and graduate school. He is goal-driven, motivated, and follows through on what \nhe says. His stated intent is not to use marijuana again. \n \n \nAs people mature, their values change. What is important to a high school \nstudent or a single college student does not have the same importance to a married \nman with his first full-time job. Marijuana usage is often more frequent with college \nstudents than with working individuals. As Applicant matured his marijuana usage \ndecreased. His frequent of use first decrease when he started dating his wife. It further \ndecreased when he left college and went to graduate school and has stopped since his \nmarriage. Applicant appears to have outgrown his marijuana use.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H, drug involvement : FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.

Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant admitted the allegations and offered explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor. He was educated in Iraq, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature. He worked as a linguist and program researcher for the Iraqi National Congress, an agency funded by the U.S. and composed of political groups opposed to Saddam Hussein, from March 1994 to August 1996 (Tr. 40, 46-48).

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on April 26, 2008. On \nMarch 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document and requested a decision \non the record without a hearing. DOHA received his answer on April 15, 2008. On April \n29, 2008, Department Counsel requested a hearing (Tr. 16; Hearing Exhibit (HX) II). \n(HX I is discussed below.) Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 12, 2008, \nand the case was assigned to me on May 14, 2008. Scheduling of the hearing was \ndelayed by Applicant\u2019s deployment to Iraq. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 23, \n2008, scheduling the hearing for August 19, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA through D, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until September 19, 2008, \nto submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E, F, and G, which \nwere admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments concerning AX E, F, \nand G are attached to the record as HX III. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nAugust 27, 2008. On September 2, 2008, Applicant sent an email stating he had no \nfurther evidence to submit (HX IV). The record closed on September 2, 2008. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iraq (HX I). I took administrative notice as requested by Department Counsel (Tr. \n23). The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 2, DOHA interrogatories that included a \npersonal subject interview extracted from a report of investigation, without calling an \nauthenticating witness as required by the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the \nauthentication requirement to Applicant and he waived it (Tr. 31). Based on his \naffirmative waiver of the authentication requirement, I admitted GX 2 (Tr. 32).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant admitted the allegations \nand offered explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor. He was \neducated in Iraq, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature. He \nworked as a linguist and program researcher for the Iraqi National Congress, an agency \nfunded by the U.S. and composed of political groups opposed to Saddam Hussein, from \nMarch 1994 to August 1996 (Tr. 40, 46-48). His job was to translate English-language \ntelevision broadcasts such as CNN and the BBC. He worked for the Iraqi National \nCongress because it offered a well-paying job, not for political reasons (Tr. 47-48).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhen persons associated with the Iraqi National Congress were threatened by \nSaddam Hussein, Applicant was evacuated by the U.S. military to Turkey and then to \nGuam in September 1996 (GX 2 at 11). While in Guam he volunteered to be a translator \nfor the refugees from Iraq (Tr. 40). He was granted political asylum in the U.S. in \nFebruary 1997.  \n \nApplicant married a U.S. citizen in August 2000, and he became a U.S. citizen in \nFebruary 2006. He and his wife have two children, ages seven and six. One of his sons \nis autistic and requires considerable attention (Tr. 70). He has two stepchildren from his \nwife\u2019s first marriage, ages 19 and 17. His wife does not work outside the home. They \nlive in the house owned by Applicant\u2019s wife, which she acquired as part of a divorce \nsettlement (Tr. 68). \n \n \nApplicant was briefly employed by a defense contractor from April to June 2006, \nbut was terminated when his application for an interim clearance was denied (GX 2 at \n7). The denial was based on concerns about his travel to Iraq in March 2005 without a \npassport. He subsequently established that he traveled to Iraq using a travel document \nissued by the Department of Homeland Security in lieu of a passport (AX B). He \nreceived an interim clearance in December 2006 (Tr. 6).  \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer since January 2007 (Tr. 42) and \nhas been deployed to Iraq since August 2007. His duties involve translation of materials \nassociated with the capture of high profile criminals who direct or conduct acts of \nviolence against Coalition Forces. His team chief regards him as talented and \ncompletely loyal (Answer to SOR). His current site manager describes him as having an \n\u201coverwhelming sense of duty\u201d and so skillful that he is sought out for \u201chot\u201d issues and \nspecial projects (AX F). His detachment chief describes him as \u201can inspiring example of \nselfless service\u201d who has performed flawlessly (AX G). He received a certificate of \nappreciation for his performance in March 2008 (AX D). He also has received three unit \ncoins, given as traditional military expressions of appreciation by U.S. military units (Tr. \n74).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members live in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq, an area he \nconsiders relatively safe (Tr. 43, 66-67). None of Applicant\u2019s family members are \nconnected to the government of Iraq. He does not work near his family and is not \nallowed to visit them. His family members believe he is living and working in the U.S. \n(Tr. 44).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iraq. His father is a retired truck \ndriver and his mother is a homemaker (Tr. 53-54; GX 2 at 10). His parents are both 80 \nyears old. He traveled to Iraq in March 2005 for three weeks to visit his parents, after \nnot seeing them for nine years, because they are elderly, he missed them, and he was \nnot sure when he would have another opportunity to visit them (GX 2 at 3).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s three sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq, and all three are \nhomemakers. The husband of one sister owns a small restaurant, one is a truck driver, \nand one is a crane operator (Tr. 60-63; GX 2 at 10-11).  \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s five brothers are citizens and residents of Iraq. Two brothers \nlive with their parents (Tr. 54). One of these two brothers sells clothing and the other \nworks in a bank (Tr. 56, 59). The third brother is married and is a cab driver (Tr. 54-55).  \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s brothers left Iraq as refugees. One brother now lives in \nGermany and works in a fast food restaurant (Tr. 58). The other brother is a citizen and \nresident of the Netherlands, and he is employed by a seafood company (Tr. 56-57).  \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s married siblings have children, some of whom are adults. He \nhas about 12 nieces and nephews in Iraq. None of his siblings or their children are \nconnected to the Iraqi government. \n \nApplicant works in a military compound and is not allowed to leave the compound \nor to accompany troops on combat missions (Tr. 67). He contacts his family by \ntelephone or by email, but he uses the telephone only when he is in the U.S. He does \nnot call his family from Iraq (Tr. 64). If his family calls his home in the U.S. while he is \ndeployed, his wife tells them he is \u201cat work,\u201d but she does not tell them where he is (Tr. \n64). \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in December 2006, he \nwas contacting his parents and the two brothers who live with them about once a month \nby telephone, and he was contacting his two married brothers once or twice a month. \nHe did not maintain regular contact with his sisters (GX 2 at 3). Since his deployment, \nApplicant\u2019s family contacts have been less frequent. He last talked to his parents in \nDecember 2007 (Tr. 67).  \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts. In 2003, a U.S.-led \ncoalition of military forces removed Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist party from power. \nA new Iraqi constitution was adopted in 2005, establishing a constitutional democracy \nand guaranteeing all Iraqis basic human rights. In March 2006, a freely elected \ngovernment took office. The U.S. government strongly supports the government of Iraq \nwith military forces and economic assistance. The policy of the U.S. is to help Iraq build \n\u201ca constitutional, representative government that respects the human rights of all Iraqis \nand has security forces capable of maintaining order and preventing the country from \nbecoming a safe haven for terrorists and foreign fighters.\u201d1 Weak performance by the \nIraqi government in upholding the rule of law has resulted in widespread human rights \nabuses, including: \u201ca pervasive climate of violence; misappropriation of official authority \nby sectarian, criminal, terrorist and insurgent groups; arbitrary deprivation of life; \ndisappearances; torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \npunishment.\u201d2 Widespread violence, principally inflicted by insurgent and terrorist \n                                                          \n1 U.S. Dept. of State, Background Note: Iraq, Feb. 2008 at 8. \n2 U.S. Dept. of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 2007: Iraq, Mar. 11, 2008 at 1. \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngroups, remains a serious problem. Although there is no evidence that Iraq conducts \nintelligence operations against the U.S., terrorist groups operating in Iraq target U.S. \ncitizens and U.S. interests in Iraq.3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n                                                          \n3 U.S. Dept. of State, Country Specific Information, Iraq, Jan. 22, 2008 at 2. \n\n \n6 \n \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother, father, brothers, and sisters are citizens \nand residents of Iraq (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); he traveled to Iraq in March 2005 to visit his \nparents (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and he was a translator for the Iraqi National Congress from 1994 \nto 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \n\n \n7 \n \n \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Iraq in March 2005 was solely to visit his aging parents. His \nforeign travel has no independent security significance. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 \n(App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment by the Iraqi National Congress was not a political act. It \noccurred while he was a citizen and resident of Iraq. The organization was financed and \nsupported by the U.S. to orchestrate the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, and it no longer \nexists. Applicant\u2019s employment by the Iraqi National Congress raises no enumerated \ndisqualifying conditions, but it is relevant to his current vulnerability to exploitation, \npressure, or coercion by former members of the Ba\u2019athist party or its sympathizers. His \nvulnerability based on former employment is discussed below under the whole person \nconcept. \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, \na disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nThe crux of this case is Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq. The totality of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). The presence of Applicant\u2019s many family \nmembers, especially his parents and siblings, in Iraq creates the \u201cheightened risk\u201d \ncontemplated by AG \u00b6 7(a). The widespread violence among the various terrorist, \ninsurgent, and criminal elements raises the potential conflict of interest contemplated by \nAG \u00b6 7(b). I conclude both of these disqualifying conditions are raised. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant has numerous family members in Iraq, maintains contact \nwith his parents and brothers, and has feelings of affection and obligation for them. \nAlthough the U.S. and Iraq are allies, the level of violence instigated by terrorists and \ninsurgents in Iraq is high. Applicant believes the Kurdish region of Iraq where they live is \nrelatively safe, but his family is still at significant risk. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s family ties are not \u201cminimal,\u201d but he has developed \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d  \n \nApplicant has been married to a U.S. citizen for more than eight years. He has \ntwo children and two stepchildren who are U.S. citizens. He has been a U.S. citizen \nsince February 2006. His home, family, and financial resources are in the U.S.  \n \nApplicant has been employed by defense contractors since April 2006 and \ndeployed as a translator for the U.S. forces since August 2007. He volunteered for \narduous duty in a combat zone, leaving behind his American family, including his \nautistic son. He has handled numerous sensitive documents without incident. His \nsupervisors have been impressed by his loyalty, \u201coverwhelming sense of duty,\u201d and \n\u201cselfless service.\u201d He has concealed his presence in Iraq from his Iraqi family members. \nHis deployment has made it difficult to keep in contact with his family members in Iraq, \nincluding his aging parents, but he has meticulously adhered to the constraints of his \njob. He has demonstrated his loyalty to the U.S. by his actions. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n00034, 208 WL 681980 at *2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (proven record of action in \ndefense of U.S. \u201cvery important\u201d); ISCR Case No. 04-12363, 2006 WL 2725061 at *2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14 2006) (Applicant \u201cinvaluable in the war on terrorism\u201d). I conclude AG \u00b6 \n8(b) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who demonstrated an affinity for the Western culture \nby studying English literature while a college student in Iraq. He fled Iraq to escape from \nthe terrorist and insurgent elements now trying to undermine the government. He met \nand married a native-born American three years after entering the U.S. as a refugee.  \n \n \nApplicant volunteered to serve with U.S. forces in a combat zone. While his \nduties do not subject him to direct combat operations, his former employment with the \nIraqi National Congress way well subject him to personal danger from former Ba\u2019athist \nparty members and sympathizers if his presence in Iraq were revealed.  \n \n \nApplicant was very candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He understands \nthat a security clearance creates a special obligation based on trust. In his closing \nstatement, he demonstrated his understanding that a clearance is a beginning, not an \nend: \u201c[If] you want to harm, you will harm the country no matter what kind of clearance \nyou have\u201d (Tr. 83).  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old-computer integration specialist for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is married (for 24 years) and has no children. He served in the Air Force for 20 years (spanning March 1984 and March 2004) and has many earned service medals that commemorate his military service. He filled out security clearance applications in the Air Force, and has held a clearance while in the Air Force (R.T., at 71-74), and has held a clearance for most of his tenure with his current defense contractor, commencing in 1978 (R.T., at 83-84, 89-90). 3 Applicant and his wife (W) engaged in a domestic quarrel in October 2006 after he told W\u2019s sister that he was contemplating a divorce (see ex. 3; R.T., at 62). W learned of the disclosure and exploded with anger (R.T., at 62). When she returned home, she confronted Applicant. An argument ensued, and W slammed the door (putting a hole in the wall). She then hurled closed fists at Applicant, which he was able to block (ex. 3). Applicant, in turn, pushed W onto the couch to try and calm her down.

The\ncase was assigned to me on July 10, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on July 30,\n2008.  A hearing was held on July 30, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny,\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and\nseven exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 7, 2008.  Based upon a\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR\nto add subparagraph 2.e that alleges Applicant omitted to list his domestic pled\nmisdemeanor corporal injury offense when answering subparagraph 23.f of his e-QIs in\nOctober 2006, and December 2006.  For good cause shown, Department Counsel\u2019s\nmotion was granted.  Applicant denied the amended incorporated allegation.   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in October1996\nand charged with inflict corporal injury on spouse (a felony offense), (2) terrorist threats\n(a felony offense), and obstruct justice (a felony offense), to which he pled guilty to a\nlesser charge of spousal abuse and was sentenced to 18 months of probation and\nordered to complete an anger management course, which he had not completed as of\nJanuary 2008.  \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (I) falsified the security clearance\napplication (e-QIP) he completed in October 2006 by failing to disclose his earlier felony\narrest/charges in October 2006 arrest in multiple places on the form, (ii) reiterated his\narrest/charges when completing an updated e-QIP in December 2006, and (iii) failed to\ndisclose his 2006 arrest/charges until confronted by an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) in March 2007.  \n For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his criminal charges but denied\nfalsifying his security clearance applications and misleading the OPM interviewer who\ncam to interview Applicant in March 2007. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old-computer integration specialist for a defense contractor\nwho seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is married (for 24 years) and has no children.  He served in the Air\nForce for 20 years (spanning March 1984 and March 2004) and has many earned\nservice medals that commemorate his military service.  He filled out security clearance\napplications in the Air Force, and has held a clearance while in the Air Force (R.T., at\n71-74), and has held a clearance for most of his tenure with his current defense\ncontractor, commencing in 1978 (R.T., at 83-84, 89-90).  \n\n3\nApplicant and his wife (W) engaged in a domestic quarrel in October 2006 after\nhe told W\u2019s sister that he was contemplating a divorce (see ex. 3; R.T., at 62).  W\nlearned of the disclosure and exploded with anger (R.T., at 62).  When she returned\nhome, she confronted Applicant.  An argument ensued, and W slammed the door\n(putting a hole in the wall).  She then hurled closed fists at Applicant, which he was able\nto block (ex. 3).  Applicant, in turn, pushed W onto the couch to try and calm her down.\nWhen W first tried to call the police, Applicant knocked the phone out of her hand,\nbreaking the phone (ex. 3).  W then picked up another phone and called the police\n(R.T., at 63-64).  When police responded to the call, they arrested Applicant, placed him\nin custody, and charged him with domestic assault (see ex. 3).\nThe police charged Applicant with felony domestic assault on the date of his\narrest in October 2996 (R.T., at 64, 94-98, 101-02). In his first court appearance in\nNovember 2006, the court explained the newly amended  misdemeanor charges filed\non October 30, 2006 to him, and afforded him the opportunity to obtain an attorney\n(R.T., at 65, 85).  The State\u2019s amended charge (see ex. G) replaced the felony assault\ncharge with a reduced charge of corporal injury to spouse/co-habitant/child\u2019s parent (a\nmisdemeanor offense). \n When Applicant appeared in court for his second court appearance, he pleaded\nguilty to the amended lesser spousal abuse charge and was sentenced to 18 months of\nunsupervised probation and ordered to complete an anger management course by May\n2008 (R.T., at 66-67).  He was told that if he provided proof of completing the\nconditioned anger management course, the misdemeanor charge would be dropped\n(R.T., at 66-67, 85-86). The court also issued a restraining order on Applicant, which W\nsubsequently had revoked. \n By January 2008, Applicant had still not signed up for the course.  He\ndocuments completing the course, however, in April 2008 and fulfilling his probation\nrequirements (see ex. F; R.T., at 68-69).  Appellant claims the misdemeanor charges\nhave been dismissed, but provides no documented proof.\nApplicant and W continue to live together for the benefit of their child who needs\nApplicant\u2019s medical insurance (see ex. 3).  While neither Applicant nor W have filed for\ndivorce, both contemplate legal separation based on incompatibility (ex. 3).  \nApplicant was asked to complete an e-QIP in early October 2006 (before his\n2006 offense).  Before he could electronically complete and return the form, the incident\nwith his wife occurred. Bt the time he certified the e-QIP and returned it to his command\nfor processing, the intervening incident with W had transpired (R.T., at 78).  However,\nApplicant did not go back and list his omitted initial felony domestic assault charges\n(which had not yet been amended), when answering sub-sections a and c of question\n23 (see ex. 2; R.T., at 78-82).  He also omitted his same charges when answering\nquestion 23.e (ex. 2) of the same e-QIP.  Applicant claimed he had completed his\nOctober 2006 e-QIP before learning that any actual charges had been filed or lodged\nagainst him (R.T., at 60).  He assures he did not purposely omit his October 2006\n\n4\ndomestic incident, and advised his supervisor of the 2006 arrest while filling out the\ninitial e-QIP form on his computer (R.T., at 59).  He attributes his omissions to haste\nand his claimed belief that the charges would be dismissed and would not be material\nthereafter (R.T., at 59-60). Police and court records reveal that police filed felony\ncharges against him in connection with his arrest and initially pressed those charges.\nApplicant was unable to convincingly show otherwise.\nIn December 2006, Applicant\u2019s FSO asked him to complete an updated SF-86.\nIn this updated application, Applicant repeated, without reviewing his answers, the same\nomissions he made about his domestic arrest/charges in his earlier e-QIP.(see ex. 2;\nR.T., at 86-87).  He had no explanation, though, for his omission of the amended\nmisdemeanor charges in this updated application.  When considered together with his\nearlier omissions, his explanations have no credible thread of mistaken assumptions or\nconsistency.   \nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding his domestic arrest and\ncharges associated with his earlier October 2006 domestic violence arrest, the\namendments, and Applicant\u2019s ensuing guilty plea, his explanations cannot be reconciled\nwith the time-line of events that culminated with his guilty plea to the amended charges. \nInferences warrant that his omissions were intentional and knowing under all the\ncircumstances known at the time, and calculated to conceal his arrest and charges from\nOPM investigators reviewing his submitted e-QIPs.  Not until confronted about his\nOctober 2006 arrest/charges in a March 2007 interview with an OPM investigator did\nApplicant disclose his same arrest/charges and disposition of the same (see exs. 2 and\n3; R.T., at 89-90).  \nApplicant\u2019s site manager confirms he was kept informed of Applicant\u2019s October\n2006 domestic incident through Applicant\u2019s chain of command (R.T., at 106-08).\nHowever, he indicated limited familiarity with the domestic charges brought against\nApplicant in October 2006 (R.T., at 111).  Applicant told his FSO of the incident with W\nand his decision not to list any charges stemming from the incident based on his belief\nthe charges would be dropped  (R.T., at 105, 111).  The FSO, in turn, relayed the\ninformation to his maintenance supervisor, who told the site manager (R.T., at 106-11).  \nApplicant\u2019s site manager credits Applicant with strong work performance (see ex.\nE).  He finds Applicant to be honest and forthcoming about problems that might impact\nhis work.  Applicant\u2019s coworkers characterize applicant as well mannered technician\nwho enjoys a good working relationship with the other members of his team (ex. E).\nApplicant\u2019s flight maintenance supervisor extols his technical and trainer skills, and\ndescribed him as the \u201cgo to\u201d technician for fixing tough problems and ensuring\ncompletion of his squadron\u2019s mission (see ex. E).\n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\n\n5\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\n\n6\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a meritorious computer integration specialist who was involved in a\nsingle domestic violence arrest and charge but twice omitted the offense in his security\nclearance applications before being confronted by an OPM investigator in a follow-up\ninterview.  Security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s arrest and omissions.\nCriminal conduct offense\nApplicant\u2019s single domestic violence arrest warrants initial consideration of  two\ndisqualifying conditions of AG \u00b6 18.  DC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses,\u201d and DC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless\nof whether the person was formally charged,\u201d has application.  Applicant\u2019s lone domestic\nviolence arrest was reduced to a misdemeanor charge to which Applicant guilty to\nspousal abuse. Applicant was, in turn, was sentenced t o18 months of probation and\nordered to complete a management course (which he did).  With the aid of the lessons\nhe acquired in his anger management course, Applicant and W have been able to\nmaintain their marriage and continue living together for the benefit of their young child.\nMost important, by his completing the anger management course, Applicant has been\nable to obtain the dismissal of the original misdemeanor charge.\nApplicant may rely on MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d in mitigation of his spousal abuse conviction.  This arrest/charge and\nconviction by itself is insufficient to warrant continuing security concerns about his\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  His FSO, site manager, and coworkers hold\nhim in high esteem and value his team work and professionalism.  These collective\nimpressions of Applicant coupled with the demonstrated responsibility he has shown in\nmaintaining his marriage in the face of the 2006 offense speak positively to Applicant\u2019s\nfamily commitments and fiducial responsibilities. \nBased on a consideration of the applicable guidelines and a whole person\nassessment, Applicant mitigates the criminal conduct specifically associated with his\nspousal abuse incident.  Taking  into account all of the facts and circumstances\n\n7\ndeveloped in the record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by subparagraph 1.a of the SOR.\nFalsification issues\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s multiple omissions of the domestic violence arrest and charges arising out of\nthis incident in the security clearance application forms he completed in October 2006,\nand again in December 2006., and in his withholding of his arrest/charges until he was\nconfronted in an ensuing OPM interview.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared\nto see classified information that deviation tolerances for candor lapses are gauged very\nnarrowly. \nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to promptly correct his\ninitial e-QIP omission in the follow-up e-QIP he was asked to complete, and before being\nconfronted in his ensuing OPM interview.  In the past, the Appeal Board has denied\napplicants availability of the predecessor mitigating condition of MC \u00b6 27(a) (the\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts) where the applicant has waited many\nmonths to timely correct a known omission. Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (Appeal\nBd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (Appeal Bd. January 1995).  \nBy willfully and knowingly failing to disclose his October 2006 arrest and charges\nin two e-QIP applications, Applicant concealed materially important background\ninformation needed for the government to properly process and evaluate his security\nupdates.  His attributed reasons for his omitting his arrest/charges (belief that the\ncharges would be dismissed) are not sustainable grounds for averting inferences of\nfalsification.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his multiple e-QIP\narrest/charge omissions and lack of any prompt, good faith corrections, Applicant\u2019s\nclaims lack the necessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that he\nknowingly and deliberately withheld material background information about his prior\narrest/charges.\nKnowing and wilful falsification is also covered by the criminal conduct guidelines. \nMitigation of the criminal features of his omissions falls along a little bit different fault line\nthan is the case with personal conduct considerations.  Here, Applicant\u2019s positive work\nrecord and demonstrated family commitments play a major role in mitigating criminal\nconduct coverage of his omissions.  MC \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d has application.\nEmployment of this guideline and the use of separate whole-person weighing of\nApplicant\u2019s actions and contributions to the military, his professional achievements, and\nhis community support enable him to mitigate the criminal conduct coverage of his e-QIP\nomissions.\n\n8\nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to subparagraphs 2.a through 2.e of Guideline E. Favorable\nconclusions warrant, however, with respect to subparagraph 1.b of Guideline J.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                   AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a::\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b::\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c::\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.d::\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.e::\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 18, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 3, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing on June 20, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1-\n5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and\npresented the testimony of one witness. He did not submit any exhibits. DOHA received\nJuly 10, 2008\n\n2\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June 30, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 21, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b of the SOR. He also admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a\n2.b of the SOR. Applicant provided additional information to support his request for\neligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 22-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 2004. After high school, he was accepted into an apprenticeship program\nwith a defense contractor in 2004. He has been employed with his current employer\nsince October 2004 (Tr. 16). \nApplicant is single. He has an infant daughter. He plans to wed the mother of his\nbaby daughter. He expects to receive a raise very soon based on the high grades he\nreceived during his apprenticeship. He wants to succeed in the company and needs a\nsecurity clearance to reach his goal.\nOn March 29, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony Possession\nof Burglary Tools, Tampering with Vehicle, and Trespassing. He pleaded guilty and was\nsentenced to 12 months incarceration with 11 months suspended. He served 15 days of\nweekend community service. The court fined him $500 and sentenced him to six\nmonths of supervised probation.\nApplicant acknowledged that he was hanging out with the wrong crowd at the\ntime of the 2005 incident. He was spending time with some people from his\nneighborhood. He and another fellow were driving around looking for rims to take from\ncars. On this particular date, Applicant saw a police car and started to run away.\nApplicant had several car jacks in his automobile and the police charged him with\npossession of burglary tools. Applicant spent a night in jail. His mother had a bond\nposted and retrieved him the next day (GE 5).\nIn April 2005, Applicant was working in the shipyard. It was his last day and his\nsupervisor was giving him a party. The supervisor ordered pizza for the party early that\nmorning. The pizza was to be delivered around noon (Tr. 19).  However, the pizza driver\ndid not arrive until almost 12:25. By that time Applicant only had a few minutes to return\nto his duty station. Applicant took three pizzas from the delivery man. He was in a hurry\nto return to work and walked back to the gate and did not pay for the pizzas.  He\nreceived a message from a detective after work about the stolen pizzas. Applicant\ncalled the store owner and told him that he was in a hurry and did not pay at the time of\ndelivery. However, he explained that he would pay for them and asked the owner not to\npress charges. Applicant paid for the pizzas and he believed that everything was\nresolved (Tr. 21). Nonetheless, Applicant was found guilty of the charge, sentenced to a\n\n3\nsix-month suspended sentence, fined, and required to complete 24 hours of community\nservice (GE 4).\nIn April 2007, Applicant attended a party at a friend\u2019s house. He gave someone a\nride home because the person had been drinking. Applicant noticed after he dropped\nhim off that the fellow left a bottle in the car. Applicant did not notice the bottle. Applicant\nwas shortly thereafter stopped for speeding. He was going 12 miles over the speed\nlimit. He was given a ticket for speeding, open container, and obstructed view. Applicant\nhad custom lettering on the back rear-view mirror of his car. Applicant explained that he\nasked the officer to give him a Breathalyzer test because he knew he had not been\ndrinking. Applicant was found guilty of the open container charge and speeding. He was\nfined. He was also on probation for speeding tickets until February 2008. Applicant\nsuccessfully completed his probation period (Tr. 24).\nApplicant admitted that he was immature and acted in a stupid manner in the\npast. He has a good job and he understands that there was no reason for him to be\ninvolved in any activity that would jeopardize the job that he loves. He does not maintain\nany friendships with the fellows from the neighborhood. Applicant believes that now that\nhe is a father and has the responsibility for his family that he would never engage in any\nbehavior that would cause concern. He also acknowledged that he has little free time\nnow that he is working and caring for his infant daughter (Tr. 32).\nApplicant\u2019s teacher and mentor from the apprenticeship program at work highly\nrecommends Applicant. He has known him since the beginning of the apprenticeship.\nApplicant has maintained high grades. His teacher rates Applicant as one of the top\nthree in the program. Applicant\u2019s teacher has weekly contact with him. He trusts him\nand took time off from his schedule to testify for Applicant at the hearing. He also knows\nthe security concerns that the Government has with respect to the incidents in\nApplicant\u2019s past and still highly recommends him. The witness has been with the\ncompany for 17 years and works with all the apprentices in this particular program (Tr.\n40). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\n\n4\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30, \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 31(a), an Asingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@ may be potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 31(c), Aallegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged or convicted@ may raise security\nconcerns. As noted above, Applicant was arrested and charged with a number of\n\n5\nincidents in 2005. He was convicted of possession of burglary tools, tampering with a\nvehicle, trespassing and larceny. These facts are sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s criminal conduct occurred in 2005. His citation for speeding and\nopen container was in 2007. However, Applicant was very young and has not had any\nmore incidents. The repeated incidents do create some doubt about Applicant\u2019s\njudgment. This potentially mitigating condition partially applies in this case. \nUnder AG & 30(d), it may be mitigating where Athere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\nhas been employed in the apprenticeship program for more than three years. He has\nhigh grades and will complete the program this year. His teacher/mentor recommends\nApplicant for the clearance due to his work skill and attitude. He has no recorded\ndisciplinary actions. He completed his community service and his probation. He is now a\nfather and has a family to provide for. He does not maintain friendships with the people\nfrom his old neighborhood. He works and has little free time. I find this potentially\nmitigating condition applies in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or untrust\nworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n\n6\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but\nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulation, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information;\nIn March 2005, Applicant was charged with Petit Larceny for stealing the pizzas\nfrom the delivery man at the shipyard. He did not wait to pay for the pizzas because he\nwanted to return to work. He was found guilty, was fined, sentenced to six-months\nsuspended sentence and 24 hours of community service.\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and many not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information.\nApplicant\u2019s speeding ticket in 2007 and driving with an open container relates to\npoor judgment and falls under 16(d). \nThe AG \u00b6 16 continues:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing. \nThis disqualifying condition is a factor for consideration because Applicant was\nembarrassed about the incidents.\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically,\nAG \u00b6 17 states:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgement. \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d does apply. \n\n7\nAG 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress is a factor for consideration. \nApplicant acknowledged that his behavior was stupid in the past. He was young\nand was hanging with the wrong crowd. He no longer associates with that group. He is\ncareful not to speed and is aware of the risks associated with speeding. He completed\nhis probation successfully. He works hard and is supporting his family. His employer\nrecommends him. He related his convictions to the investigator and completed his\nsecurity questionnaire truthfully listing the above referenced convictions and charges.\nHe has mitigated any personal conduct concerns through his recent actions and\nbehavior. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a hard working young\nman. He has been apprenticed to his employer for more than three years. He has\nconsistently received high  grades. He is highly recommended for a clearance. He is a\nfather and is providing for his family. He is a loyal employee. He is enthusiastic about\nhis job. He is stable and concerned about his future. The incidents in 2005 and 2007\noccurred when Applicant was immature and younger. He has no other incidents on his\nrecord.\nOverall, the record evidence and whole person analysis leaves me without questions\nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his\npersonal conduct and criminal conduct. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

However, the record does not reflect the relationship, if \nany, between her medical bills and other delinquent debts such as the bad check (SOR \n\u00b6 1.j), satellite TV account (SOR \u00b6 1.l), credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.m), cable TV bill \n(SOR \u00b6 1.q), and the various collection accounts and judgments alleged in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2007, solely in \nher name. She had made three payments to the bankruptcy trustee at the time the SOR \nwas issued. The record does not reflect what actions, if any, Applicant took to resolve \nher debts before filing for bankruptcy. It does reflect, however, that she received the \ncounseling required by the bankruptcy court on November 7, 2007 (GX 6 at 5). \n \nIn her bankruptcy petition, Applicant reported her net monthly income as \n$3,210.33 and her spouse\u2019s as $1,917.29, totaling $5,127.62 (GX 6 at 27). She reported \ntotal monthly expenses of $4,916.95 for the family, leaving a net remainder of $210.67. \nThe family expenses include a \u201cSpouse\u2019s Monthly Chapter 13 Payment\u201d of $469.95 (GX \n6 at 28). Applicant is required to pay $210 per month to the bankruptcy trustee (GX 6 at \n1). As of April 18, 2008, she had made three $210 payments to the trustee, the last on \nMarch 31, 2008, a few days before the SOR was issued (GX 7 at 2).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the \ntable below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount\nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nMedical \n$1,782 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 1; GX 6 at 24 \n1.b \nMedical \n$559 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 1-2; GX 6 at 24 \n1.c \nMedical \n$836 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 2; GX 6 at 24 \n1.d \nMedical \n$1,682 \nSame debt as 1.a \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at 24 \n1.e \nMedical \n$806 \nSame debt as 1.c \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at 24 \n1.f \nMedical \n$530 \nSame debt as 1.b \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at 24 \n1.g \nMedical \n$432 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at 23 \n1.h \nMedical \n$100 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at 23 \n1.i \nMedical \n$263 \nNot in bankruptcy petition \nGX 5 at 3 \n1.j \nBad check \n$372 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 1; GX 6 at 24 \n1.k \nCollection \n$127 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at 23 \n1.l \nSatellite TV \n$110 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 3; GX 6 at 22 \n1.m \nCredit card \n$1,290 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 5 at 4; GX 6 at 22 \n1.n \nCollection \n$210 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 8 at 6; GX 6 at 23 \n1.o \nCollection \n$1,632 \nSame debt as 1.d \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s \nSubmission \n1.p \nCollection \n$558 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 8 at 11; GX 6 at 24 \n1.q \nCable TV \n$325 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 8 at 12; GX 6 at 22 \n1.r \nJudgment \n$4,735 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 8 at 4; GX 6 at 23 \n1.s \nJudgment \n$547 \nIncluded in bankruptcy \nGX 8 at 4; GX 6 at 23 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts and two unpaid judgments totaling about \n$16,835. Nine debts are identified as medical bills. Only one debt, the medical bill \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, is not listed in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \n \n \nThe evidence indicates that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.o are \nduplicates of other debts alleged in the SOR. When the same conduct is alleged twice \nin the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at \n\n \n5 \n \n \n3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.o in \nApplicant=s favor.   \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e); however, AG \u00b6 19(b) is not \nraised because there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d  \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established \nbecause Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are ongoing and numerous. The evidence is too \nsparse to show the debts occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nrecur. The record reflects that Applicant incurred medical bills as a result of a car \naccident while she was self-employed, but it does not reflect whether she had insurance \nin her own right or through her spouse\u2019s employment. It does not reflect Applicant\u2019s \noverall financial situation at the time the bills were incurred, the impact of the car \naccident on her ability to work, the attempts she made to resolve the medical bills, and \nthe relationship between her medical bills and the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nSimilarly, the absence of evidence showing her response to her medical debts makes it \nimpossible to determine whether her conduct casts doubt on her currently reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant has not carried her burden of establishing \nAG \u00b6 20(a). \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e, conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. While the car accident \nand resulting medical bills were a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control, there is no \nevidence on the issue whether she responded to that condition responsibly. Applicant \nhas not carried her burden of establishing this mitigating condition \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive. If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. \n \nThe only counseling reflected in the record was required by the bankruptcy court. \nIt is too soon to determine whether Applicant will adhere to the required payment plan \nand resolve her financial problems. I conclude she has not carried her burden of \nestablishing this mitigating condition. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \n \nBankruptcy is a legally permissible means of resolving financial problems, but it \ndoes not necessarily establish the \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d contemplated by AG \u00b6 20(d). See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-25086 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-26675 \n\n \n7 \n \n \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2003; ISCR Case No. 98-0445 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 1999). A \nChapter 13 plan for repaying debts, instead of a Chapter 7 petition for discharge of \nthose debts, tends to show good faith. In this case, however, there is an absence of \nevidence showing Applicant\u2019s efforts, if any to resolve the debts before filing for \nbankruptcy, or relationship between her medical debts and the non-medical debts \nalleged in the SOR. Too little time has elapsed to establish a track record of complying \nwith the Chapter 13 payment schedule. Applicant has not carried her burden of \nestablishing this mitigating condition. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nThe record in this case is very sparse. It reveals little about Applicant\u2019s \nbackground and reputation, the circumstances leading to her financial difficulties, and \nher responses to those difficulties. The responsibility for the absence of evidence falls \nlargely on Applicant, who has the burden of demonstrating her suitability for a security \nclearance. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.s: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \n2 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated May 9, 2008; \nand Applicant acknowledged receipt on May 21, 2008, which DOHA received on July 25, 2008. \nThe DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to \nsubmit information. \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n4 Id. \n \n\n \n3\n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial history and \nincluded the review of her April 2007 e-QIP,5 her March 2008 DOHA Financial \nInterrogatory,6 a March 2008 Applicant letter with attachments,7 and her \nNovember 2007 credit bureau report.8  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 12 separate line items consisting of various \ndebts, totaling approximately $38,543. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.l.  Included among the line \nitems were her failure to file her 2005 federal income tax return, her failure to pay \nall federal income tax owed for tax year 2006 resulting in a $4,161 tax deficiency, \nand her failure to pay all her state income tax owed for tax years 2005 and 2006 \nresulting in a $914 and $2,346 deficiencies, respectively. (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.i., 1.j., 1.k. \nand 1.l.) \n \nSince Applicant\u2019s May 2008 SOR, she has paid, settled, made a good faith-\neffort to pay/settle, or otherwise resolve all debts listed in that SOR. In particular, \nshe has filed her 2005 federal income tax return, is making payments to the \nInternal Revenue Service for her 2006 tax deficiency, and has paid her 2005 and \n2006 state income tax deficiencies through garnishment. The other debts consist \nof credit card/personal debts, which have been addressed. The remaining debt of \nconsequence is a charged off credit card debt of $12,611, which is in litigation \nwith settlement and payment arrangements pending. Response to SOR, \nResponse to FORM. \n \nApplicant encountered financial problems as a result of her inability to sell \nher second home/loss of rental income, and medical/ financial costs incurred as a \nresult of assisting her adult son with his drug abuse/treatment problems. \n \nShe explained in her Response to FORM: \n \n[M]y problems basically began when I was trying to sell a house that \nI owned in [different state]. My outstanding credit was high at that \ntime as I had spent a considerable amount on my son\u2019s drug \nrehabilitation, medical and living expenses, but I was keeping up \nwith all my payments and responsibilities. However, without the \nrental income, and due to the extra mortgage and utility payments, I \nbegan falling behind. \n \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Item 5. \n \n7 Item 6. \n \n8 Item 7. \n \n\n \n4\nI called my creditors and tried to make arrangements that I could \nmeet. However, since I was not behind, for the most part they were \nnot willing to work with me. When the house sold, I did not receive a \nlot of cash, but with what I did receive, I paid down several credit \ncards, only to have them lower my limits (costing me additional over-\nlimit fees) and raise my interest to exorbitant fees. \n \nAdditionally, the sale of the house also made a big change in my tax \nstatus, and I ended up with both state and federal taxes due. Before \nI dealt with that properly, the [state of residence] garnished my \nwages for overdue taxes.  \n \nIt is not my poor self control or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations that brought me into this state. A lack of judgment \nperhaps, because I spent too much to rehabilitate and support my \nson, and because in trying to find ways to settle my debts, I have \nbetter hindsight in knowing how to best handle these things than I \ndid at the time. \n \nIn 2007, Applicant sought financial counseling through her company\u2019s \nEmployee Assistance Program and participated in counseling and budget \nsessions. To reduce her housing costs, she has moved to a one bedroom \napartment and her son no longer lives with her. Applicant continues to pay her \nson\u2019s health insurance and provides him with limited support. In December 2007, \nApplicant took a second job as grocery clerk, but recently quit because her full-\ntime employer required her to travel and work overtime. Response to FORM. \n \nApplicant provided six reference letters offering character assessments \nfrom a professional and personal perspective. The authors were uniform in their \npraise of Applicant, and spoke of her integrity, loyalty, and recommended her for a \nclearance. Response to FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \n\n \n5\n                                                          \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d9 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \n \n9 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing \ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being \nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 \n(1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n10 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable \nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent \nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion \nunder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, \n1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 18, the Government\u2019s concern is that an Applicant\u2019s: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, \nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts \nto generate funds. \n \n \nThe Government established its case through Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nevidence presented. At the time the SOR was issued, the Applicant had a history \nof unresolved indebtedness that had been ongoing for several years. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt \nor establish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial \nbreaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, \nhigh debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, \ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n\n \n7\n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be \nexplained by subject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets \nor returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of \ngambling losses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay \ngambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by \ngambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions listed supra, \ntwo are applicable, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,11 I am able to apply \u00b6\u00b6 (b), (c), and \n(d). Applicant did experience a financial setback as a result of being unable to sell her \nsecond home. She also incurred substantial expenses in assisting her son with his \nsubstance abuse problem. Applicant did participate in financial counseling, and has \nmade a good-faith effort to pay, settle, and/or resolve her debts.  \n \n \nNothing in the record supports the notion that Applicant incurred debt to live \nextravagantly or lived a questionable lifestyle. Admittedly, her choices were not always \nthe most prudent, which she concedes. I do note and give her credit for making a good-\nfaith effort to put her financial house in order. She moved to a one bedroom apartment \nand took a part-time job as a grocery clerk until that conflicted with her full-time job. She \nhas successfully held a security clearance for the past 11 years, and enjoys the full \nsupport of her colleagues and friends. Maintaining her employment allows her to \ncontinue paying down her debts. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did meet her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has \nmitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is \neligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.l.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd.

On April 3, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 16, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\nsecurity clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nSpecifically, Department Counsel argues that the Judge improperly used the decision to pass\njudgment on prior Appeal Board precedent and that the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating conditions\nfound in \u00b6 E2.8(a) through (c) of the Directive is arbitrary and capricious and is not supported by the\nrecord evidence.  Department Counsel also contends that the Judge, in effect, improperly shifted the\nburden to Department Counsel to present evidence of a clear and present danger or imminent threat\nof espionage.  Finally, Department Counsel maintains that the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s security eligibility are not supported by the record evidence.  Finding error,\nwe reverse the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision.\nWhether the Record Evidence Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\nApplicant was born in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC).  She came to the United States\nat the age of 24 and completed her education here.  Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2006.  In\n1998, Applicant married a citizen of a Western European country.  Applicant\u2019s husband has\npermanent residency status in the U.S., but works as a civil servant in his country of birth.  They\nhave two children who were born in the U.S. and are U.S. citizens.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law,\nfather-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of her husband\u2019s country of birth.\nApplicant exchanges e-mails with her mother-in-law and sister-in-law on birthdays.  Applicant\u2019s\nparents are PRC citizens, but have permanent residency status in the U.S., and live with Applicant.\nApplicant has an emotional bond with her brother, who is a citizen of and resides in the PRC. \nDecision at 10.

Applicant also speaks to her\nmother\u2019s sister a couple of times a year.  When Applicant traveled to the PRC in 2006 to visit her\ngravely-ill grandmother, she stayed with her brother and got together with former classmates.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and her former neighbor testified to her professionalism and character.\nThe PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with a poor record on human rights.  The\nPRC\u2019s foreign policy goals are antithetical to the United States.  The PRC has an active and effective\nprogram of industrial espionage to obtain U.S. technology.  Decision at 5.          \n\n3\nB.  Discussion\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s appeal involves the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)). \u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a\nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse the\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nDepartment Counsel notes that the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision included a lengthy\nexposition on prior Appeal Board rulings which ended with the statement \u201cNotwithstanding the\nAppeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many of these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this\ncase under the whole person concept.\u201d  Footnote 10 of Decision, at page 11. Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law\nto the extent that he deliberately rejected binding agency authority.  For purposes of this discussion,\nwe set aside the fact that many of the cases cited were explicitly interpreting the plain language of\na specific Guideline which is no longer in effect and the fact that the Judge\u2019s statement of some of\nthe cited precedent is inaccurate.  Department Counsel is correct that a Hearing Office\nAdministrative Judge is not authorized to review and pass judgment on Appeal Board decisions.  The\nDirective clearly places the responsibility for review at the Appeal Board level.  More broadly, quasi-\njudicial adjudications must be made within the bounds of applicable law and agency policy, not\nwithout regard to them. See, e.g., Croplife America v. Environmental Protection Agency, 329 F.3d\n876, 882 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (administrative law judges cannot ignore agency policy in making rulings);\nNash v. Bowen, 869 F.2d 675, 680 (2d Cir. 1989) (administrative law judge is subordinate to head\nof agency or department in matters of policy); Mullen v. Bowen, 800 F.2d 535, 540 n. 5 (6th Cir.\n1986) (decisional independence does not relieve administrative law judge of the obligation to apply\nagency policy).  See  ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003) (security clearance\ndecisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards). \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s contacts and ties with relatives and friends in the PRC\nraised security concerns under Guideline B.  However the Judge concluded that the security concerns\nwere mitigated under \u00b6 E2.8(a) through (c) of the Directive.  Department Counsel argues that the\nJudge\u2019s application of those mitigating conditions is arbitrary and capricious and is not supported\nby the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  \n\n\u201c[T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\n1\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, or government and the interests of the U.S.[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(a).\nSee ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).\n2\n\u201c[C]ontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that\n3\nit could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.8(c).\n\u201c[T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\n4\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(b). \n4\nParagraph E2.8(a) of the Directive  involves an applicant\u2019s relationships with persons in\n1\nother countries.  Of particular concern in this case are Applicant\u2019s relationships with her brother and\nsister-in-law.  Both are public employees of the PRC, and Applicant\u2019s brother, the editor of a\ngovernment publication, is in a position of responsibility in the area of the PRC where he lives.  As\nnoted above, the Judge concluded that Applicant has an emotional bond with her brother.  Decision\nat 10.  Moreover, Applicant\u2019s parents, while they live with Applicant in the U.S., maintain ties to\nthe PRC.  Applicant\u2019s mother last traveled to the PRC in April 2008.  It is also significant that\nApplicant\u2019s parents suffered at the hands of the Chinese government during the Cultural Revolution.\nTranscript at 143.    Decision at 3.  Given Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s government position and her parents\n2\ncontinuing ties to the PRC, the Judge\u2019s application of \u00b6 E2.8(a) is arbitrary and capricious and is not\nsupported by the record evidence, particularly in light of the PRC\u2019s poor record on human rights,\nwhich the Judge recognized in his decision.       \nFor mitigation under \u00b6 E2.8(c) of the Directive,   contact must be casual and infrequent.  The\n3\nJudge applied mitigation with regard to Applicant\u2019s brother, who is a citizen of and resident in the\nPRC.  There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant\u2019s relationship with immediate family\nmembers is not casual.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24267 at  7 (App. Bd. May 24, 2005)  There is\nnothing in the record of this case that rebuts that presumption.  In fact, the Judge stated that\nApplicant has an emotional bond with her brother.  Decision at 10.  Applicant contacts her brother\nby phone or e-mail twice a year and speaks to her aunt with about the same frequency.  However,\nthe totality of Applicant\u2019s contacts with her relatives cannot be said to be casual.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 05-03279 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007).  Furthermore, the frequency with which an\napplicant speaks to family members does not diminish the strength of her family ties.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  Compare, also, ISCR Case No. 06-18337 (App.\nBd. Feb. 8, 2008).  In this case, Applicant is involved in the process of her brother\u2019s immigration to\nthe U.S., which is expected to take ten years.  Transcript at  134.  The record does not support the\nJudge\u2019s application of \u00b6 E2.8(c) of the Directive. \nIn applying \u00b6 E2.8(b) of the Directive,  the Judge minimized Applicant\u2019s foreign ties and\n4\nemphasized her strong connections to the United States.  Department Counsel correctly points out\n\n5\nthat Applicant\u2019s foreign ties are more significant than the Judge concluded.  Applicant has been a\nU.S. citizen only since May 2006.  Apart from her children, Applicant\u2019s family ties are to her\nbrother, her parents, and her husband.  Her brother, with whom Applicant has an emotional bond,\nis a citizen and resident of the PRC.  Applicant\u2019s parents reside in the United States, but are citizens\nof the PRC.  They have ties to the PRC and are not eligible to become U.S. citizens until 2011.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s husband has legal residency status in the U.S., he is a German citizen and a civil\nservant of a German state.  Applicant has been a permanent employee of her current employer only\nsince November 2007.  Given her ties, the Judge\u2019s application of \u00b6 E2.8(b) is arbitrary and is not\nsupported by the record evidence.\nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge, in effect, improperly shifted the burden\nto Department Counsel to present evidence of a clear and present danger or imminent threat of\nespionage.   Department Counsel\u2019s contention has merit.  Under the Directive, once the Judge finds\nthat security concerns have been raised, the burden shifts to an applicant to extenuate or mitigate\nthose concerns.  Department Counsel is not required to prove a threat of espionage.  See, e.g.,ISCR\nCase No. 02-09907 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2004).   The Judge concluded that there was little\nlikelihood that the PRC would use the presence of Applicant\u2019s brother and his wife to pressure or\ncoerce Applicant because her brother and his wife lead low-profile, non-political lives and have not\nbeen approached or threatened due to their relationship with Applicant and because there is no\nindication that the PRC is aware of Applicant\u2019s career in the United States.  The Board has\nconsistently held that factors such as an applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 obscurity or the failure of foreign\nauthorities to contact those relatives in the past do not provide a meaningful measure of whether an\napplicant\u2019s circumstances pose a security risk.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 4 (App. Bd.\nAug. 25, 2006).  The Judge\u2019s conclusions in this regard are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nFinally, Department Counsel maintains that the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions regarding\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility are not supported by the record evidence.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s\neligibility under the whole-person concept, the Judge used similar analysis and reached conclusions\nsimilar to those discussed above.  The Judge relied in part on the same erroneous conclusions\ndiscussed above, e.g., conclusions regarding the application of \u00b6 E2.8(a) through (c).  The Judge also\nrelied in part on his determination regarding Applicant\u2019s credibility.  While a Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination is entitled to deference, it is not a substitute for record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-14995 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).  In light of the record as a whole, the Judge did not\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for his favorable conclusions, and his decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

(Tr. 120, Ex. F) In May 2006, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 101) Applicant \ndefinitely does not wish to return to living in China. (Tr. 146)  \n \n \nApplicant was previously married to a citizen and resident of the PRC. They were \nmarried from May 1993 to April 2005. (Tr. 119) She has had no contact with her ex-\nhusband since the divorce and there are no children from this marriage. (Tr. 119)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a citizen of Germany and a permanent resident of the \nUnited States. He came to the U.S. in 1990 and obtained his permanent residency \nstatus in July 1995. He came to the U.S. to pursue his studies and obtained a PhD in \n1995. (Tr. 69) He is a full professor at a German university and has been a faculty \nmember in German, since 2003. As a faculty member, he is considered a German civil \nservant. (Tr. 74) He is a civil servant employed by the individual state government and \nnot by the federal German government. (Tr. 74)  \n \nWhen not in school, her husband lives with her in the U.S. Normally, he spends \nfour or five months of the year in the U.S. (Tr. 71) His desire has always been to return \nto the U.S. and to have his home in the U.S. Her husband was previously an assistant \nprofessor at a state university in the U.S. It has always been Applicant\u2019s and her \nhusband\u2019s intention to make the U.S. their home and to raise their family in the U.S. (Tr. \n76, 99) Applicant and her husband intend their children to be only U.S. citizens and not \ndual citizens. (Tr. 100) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is 79 years old and her mother-in-law is 75 years old. \nThey are both retired high school teachers. Her father-in-law taught high school Greek \nand Latin. (Tr. 79) Her mother-in-law taught home economics and physical education. \n(Tr. 79) They are both citizens and residents of Germany. They separated in 1995. (Tr. \n78) Since the separation, Applicant\u2019s husband has had no contact with his father. \nApplicant has never had contact with her father-in-law. Her mother-in-law has visited the \nU.S. with her longest visit being six weeks. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law, age 45, is a nurse \nat a children\u2019s hospital and is a citizen and resident of Germany. (Tr. 80) Her sister-in-\nlaw maintains close ties with Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law. They live approximately 50 \nmiles apart. (Tr. 97) Applicant has infrequent contact with her sister-in-law. Applicant \nexchanges e-mails with her mother-in-law and sister-in-law on birthdays. (Tr. 159) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in China and lived in the PRC. Her father, age 68, \nis a retired university biology professor and her mother, age 67, is a retired middle \nschool biology teacher. (Tr. 109) They receive monthly retirement checks from the PRC \nof $500 each. (Tr. 124, 147) In 2001, Applicant\u2019s mother came to the live with Applicant \nin the U.S. (Tr. 120) Her mother has returned to China two or three times with her last \nvisit in April 2008. (Tr. 121) Before obtaining their permanent resident status, they were \nrequired to leave the country every six month, although they requested and received \nextensions on that requirement. (Tr. 149 - 150) Her mother\u2019s most recent visit was to \nobtain a medical physical. (Tr. 122) In 2003, Applicant\u2019s father came to live with her full \ntime in the U.S. (Tr. 125) In oriental culture, it is natural for parents to live with a \ndaughter as they get older. (Tr. 109, 141) Her father has returned to China twice, once \n\n \n \n \n4\nto visit his sick mother. (Tr. 126) In 2006, her parents obtained permanent resident \nstatus in the U.S. They could not apply for a green card until Applicant had become a \nU.S. citizen. (Tr. 140) In 2011, her parents first become eligible for U.S. citizenship.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of the PRC. He is 42 years old and is \nthe editor of an internal newsletter/magazine/publication (Tr. 111, Ex. G) that serves the \nlocal government agencies in his province. (Tr. 129) The publication is state owned. In \n2006, Applicant visited the PRC for two-weeks. She stayed with her brother during her \nvisit and contacts him twice a year by telephone or email. (Ex 2, 9, the first page of a \nJune 2007, Personal Subject Interview (PSI)) During the Cultural Revolution the schools \nwere closed and the teachers, which included her parents, were sent to the country for \nre-education. (Tr. 143) Applicant\u2019s grandmother, her mother\u2019s mother, raised Applicant \nand Applicant\u2019s brother was raised by her other grandmother, her father\u2019s mother. (Tr. \n143) From the time she was born until age six, she lived with her grandmother. (Tr. 144) \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law have applied for permanent residence in the \nU.S. and intend to immigrate to the U.S. (Exs. B, C, and D) They are excited about \nbecoming U.S. citizens. (Tr. 108) It is estimated, it will take approximately 10 years \nbefore they are eligible to come to the U.S. Her brother received his education as a \nlibrarian before obtaining his job as a reporter and then editor for a government \npublication about population control. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a university librarian. \n(Tr. 135)  \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant traveled to the PRC for two weeks. (Ex. 2, PSI page \n2) This was the first time since coming to the U.S. in 1993 that she visited the PRC. (Tr. \n112) The primary purpose of the trip was to see her severely ill 90-year-old \ngrandmother, who had suffered a heart attack, and to let her grandmother meet \nApplicant\u2019s son. While in the PRC, she met some high school friends. (Tr. 131) She \nexchanged a couple of emails with one friend shortly before her return to the PRC to set \nup a get together with high school friends. The PRC had changed greatly during the 13 \nyears she has been gone. Her trip reinforced her belief that she made the right decision \nto come to the U.S. and how lucky she is to have the life she has. (Tr. 146)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father has a sister living in the PRC and her mother has three siblings \nliving in the PRC. (Tr. 144) Applicant talks with her mother\u2019s sister a couple of times a \nyear. (Tr. 145) They usually talk about how their children are doing.  \n \n \nShould Applicant\u2019s husband retire in Germany at some future time, the state \nwould be responsible to pay his benison benefits. However, if he resigns from his \nposition as professor and leaves the European Union, he would forfeit his pension \nbenefits. (Tr. 75) Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s retirement portfolio, as of March 2008, was \n$76,000. (Ex. I) They have approximately $200,000 in equity in their $850,000 house in \nthe U.S. which is their residence and $150,000 equity in a $650,000 rental home. (Tr. \n155, 160) They own no property outside the U.S. (Tr. 160) Applicant has approximately \n$8,000 in her 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 156) \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \nChina \n \nThe Peoples Republic of China (the PRC) is a repressive, totalitarian government \nwith foreign policy goals antithetical to the U.S., although it has cooperated with the U.S. \nin the global war on terrorism in recent years. Its authoritarian government is dominated \nby the Chinese Communist Party.2 The PRC possesses large and increasingly \nsophisticated military forces, which include strategic nuclear weapons and missiles. 3 In \nforeign relations, the PRC and the U.S. have been rivals since the Cold War, with \nparticular disagreement on the status of Taiwan. The PRC continues to resist what it \nconsiders U.S. superpower dominance, despite improving economic relations.4 \n \n The PRC has an active, effective intelligence service that targets U.S. \nintelligence and economic information, and operates against its citizens in the U.S.5 The \nPRC obtains access to restricted technology through industrial espionage and the PRC \noperates an aggressive clandestine effort to acquire additional technologies. This is \nsuch a problem that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have rated \nthe PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of \nU.S. technology.6 \n \nThe PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political \ndissent, and its practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, \ntorture, and mistreatment of prisoners.7 PRC authorities monitor telephone \nconversations, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet communication, open and censor \nmail, monitor and enter residences and offices to gain access to computers, telephones, \nand fax machines. All hotels have a sizable internal security presence and hotel \nguestrooms are sometimes bugged and searched for sensitive or proprietary material.8 \n \n Under PRC law, citizens who become naturalized citizens of other countries lose \ntheir PRC citizenship. \n \n2 U.S. Department of State, Background Note: China, dated April 2008 (Background Note on \nChina), at 16-7.

V) \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG & 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that \nthe individual=s access to protected information may involve unacceptable \nrisk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their \ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress \nexists; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation;  \n \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with foreign national; \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n                                                          \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nations from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; [and] \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a permanent U.S. resident who is a professor at a \nGerman university. As such he is a German civil servant. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and \nsister-in-law are citizens and residents of Germany. Applicant exchanges emails with \nthem twice a year, on birthdays. Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens of the PRC, but are \npermanent U.S. residents, living with her in the U.S. Her brother and sister-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of the PRC. She stayed with her brother in 2006, when she \nreturned to China for two weeks. This was the only time in since 1993 that she visited \nthe PRC. She has contact with her brother twice a year by email. She also emails her \naunt who lives in the PRC twice a year.  \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States.  \n \nThere is no concern with Germany. However, the complicated, competitive \nrelationship of the PRC with the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her relationship \nwith her relatives living in the PRC and her relatives in the U.S. with close relationships \nto family members living in the PRC does not pose a security risk and she is not in a \nposition to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and these two \npeople.9 With its mixed human rights record, and political, economic and military rivalry \n \n9 The Appeal Board has articulated a \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d in People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) cases because of that country\u2019s hostility to the United States and aggressive \nintelligence collection efforts. See ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (articulating \n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard and reversing grant of clearance in case involving family members living in \n\n \n \n \n9\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nwith the United States, it is conceivable that the PRC would target any PRC citizen or \nformer citizen living in the United States in an attempt to gather valuable information \nfrom the United States. \n \nThere is evidence that the PRC intelligence operatives seek classified or \neconomic information from U.S. businesses and/or government agencies. Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to her brother and sister-in-law create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause these relationships are sufficiently close to raise a possible security concern \nabout her desire to help these relatives living in the PRC by providing classified \ninformation.  \n \nHaving considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable \nconditions that could possibly raise a security concern,  AG & 7(a), AG & 7(b), and  AG \n& 7(d) apply. AG & 7(d) applies to her husband and parents even though her parents \nwere born in China, because they live with her in the U.S., which negates any potential \nfor adverse foreign influence or duress.  \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority;  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; [and] \n \n \nthe PRC); ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. May 9, 2008). \n\n \n \n \n10\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \n \nAG & 8(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s husband. He is a permanent U.S. resident, who \nspends part of the year teaching at a German university. As all university professors in \nGermany, he is a German civil servant. There is nothing about the country of Germany, \nher husband\u2019s position there, or his activities in Germany that will place Applicant in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of her husband, the interests of \nGermany, and the interests of the U.S.  Ever since the end of World War II, Germany \nand the U.S. have been close allies.  The U.S. and Germany are members of NATO.  \nThe U.S. and Germany routinely share classified NATO information.  Germany would \nnot coerce Applicant through her husband.  \n \nIn 1993, Applicant left the PRC, and returned just once in 1996. She and her in-\nlaws in Germany and relatives in the PRC usually exchange greetings on birthdays. Her \nrelationship with these individuals is not a security concern. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) \npartly apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s former classmates, her mother-in-law, and sister-\nin-law in Germany, her brother, sister-in-law, aunt and grandmother in the PRC because \nof her limited contacts with them. Because of her limited contact, \u201cit is unlikely [she] will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of [her relatives and in-\nlaws] and the interest of the U.S.\u201d Her infrequent contacts (once or twice a year) and not \nparticularly close relationship with her in-laws in Germany have a very low potential for \nforcing her to choose between the United States and Germany. She has infrequent \ncontacts with her grandmother, aunt, brother, and sister-in-law in the PRC.  \n \nWith her infrequent contacts and not particularly close relationships there is a low \npotential of forcing her to choose between the United States and the PRC. Applicant \nmet her burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [her relationship with her \nrelatives and in-laws] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 03-04300 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002)). Her contacts and communications with her in-\nlaws and relatives in the PRC are sufficiently casual and infrequent as to not create a \nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant has an emotional bond with her brother. Her brother hopes to \nimmigrate to the U.S. as soon as possible and the paperwork has been submitted, but it \nis likely to be another 10 years before he is able to come to the U.S. Applicant \ncommunicates with her brother infrequently. Applicant\u2019s relationship with her brother \nand sister-in-law requires a closer examination than her relationship with her German \nin-laws and other relatives in the PRC. \n \nThere is no evidence that her brother or sister-in-law have been political activists, \nchallenging the policies of the PRC Government. Both currently work for the PRC \nGovernment. Her sister-in-law works as a librarian for a university and all PRC \nuniversities are state run. Her brother was a librarian before he became a reporter and \nthen the editor of a population control publication which is a PRC publication. There is \n\n \n \n \n11\n                                                          \nno evidence that terrorists or the PRC Government have approached or threatened \nApplicant, her brother, or sister-in-law for any reason. There is no evidence that these \nrelatives living in the PRC currently engage in activities which would bring attention to \nthem or that they or other PRC elements are even aware that Applicant works for a \ngovernment contractor or might have access to classified information. As such, there is \na reduced possibility that her brother and sister-in-law would be targets for coercion or \nexploitation. But see n. 10, infra (discussing limited weight that can be given to the \nabsence of such information). \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her brother and the nature of the PRC Government \nand its complicated and sometimes contentious relationship to the United States, all \nweigh against mitigating security concerns. See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007) (finding contacts with siblings in PRC \u201conce every two or three \nmonths\u201d not to be casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 \ntimes per year not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months \nnot casual and infrequent).10 Here, Applicant\u2019s contact with her brother is twice a year \nand, as such, is considered infrequent. Her communications are not casual because \nshe has a warm regard for her brother. \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with her children and her strong connections to the \nUnited States mitigates foreign interest security concerns. Applicant has \u201csuch deep and \n \n10In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005))  and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept. \n \n\n \n \n \n12\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [she] can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Her children are U.S. citizens, and \nreside in the United States. Her husband and parents are U.S. permanent residents \nliving in the United States since 1990, 2001, and 2003. Applicant has worked for her \ngovernment contractor with dedication and distinction. She has substantial property and \ninvestments in the United States, and no property or investments in the PRC or other \nforeign location. She has many friends and colleagues in the United States. She has no \ndesire to return to live in the PRC. She is a loyal, dedicated U.S. citizen. She has \nprovided letters and witness statements to corroborate her loyalty and trustworthiness. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to the PRC and the heavy \nburden an Applicant carries when she has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning the PRC must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in the PRC. The PRC has a mixed to poor human rights record. \nThe PRC is one of the most aggressive nations in the collection of U.S. intelligence and \nsensitive economic information.  \n \nOne element increasing the foreign influence security concern is Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with her brother and her 2006 two week visit to the PRC. Her brother and \n\n \n \n \n13\n                                                          \nsister-in-law could be vulnerable to PRC coercion and non-coercive measures because \nof their PRC citizenship and where they live. They also work for the PRC government \nand the PRC government could exert pressure on them by threatening to stop or \nstopping their salary or firing them from their jobs.  \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant has lived in the United States since 1993 (except for \nher two-week visit to the PRC. She became a U.S. citizen in 2006. Her children and \nparents live with her in the United States. Her children are U.S. citizens and her parents \nU.S. permanent residents. She compellingly explained why her loyalty is to the United \nStates, rather than to the PRC. She thoroughly developed the evidence showing her \nconnections to the United States and the remote connections to the PRC. I found her \nstatements to be honest, candid and credible. She provided corroborating statements \nconcerning her loyalty and trustworthiness. She provided favorable recommendations of \nemployers and friends going back to the time of her entry into the United States.  \n \nIn a 2006 decision, the Appeal Board held the Judge properly determined under \nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept that an applicant with very significant connections to a \nforeign country had mitigated security concerns under Guideline B. In ISCR Case No. \n03-04300, 2006 DOHA Lexis 264 at *17-*21 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006),11 the applicant \nhad weekly contact with her mother (who lives in Russia), contact three times per year \nwith her aunt (who lives in Russia); contact about four times per year with her father-in-\nlaw (who lives in Russia); and multiple annual contacts with other relatives living in \nIsrael. She had visited her family in Russia and Israel, on more than one occasion, after \nimmigrating to the United States. Moreover, she owned a half interest in her mother\u2019s \napartment in Russia, and provided financial support to her mother and aunt. The \nJudge\u2019s whole person analysis (that the Appeal Board determined was sufficient to \nmitigate such significant foreign influence security concerns) provides: \n  \nLooking at all of [whole person] factors, I conclude Applicant has \novercome foreign influence security concerns. Given her strong ties to the \nU.S. and her limited contact with Russia and Israel since she became a \nU.S. naturalized citizen, there is limited potential for coercion, exploitation \nor duress. (E.2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.) All of her immediate family are in the U.S., and the majority of her \nfinancial ties are in the U.S. Applicant has been a naturalized U.S. citizen \nfor over fifteen years. She returned to Russia in April 2005 to abjure her \nRussian citizenship and has had limited visits with her mother, aunt and \nfather-in-law in 1995 and 2002. She provides minimal support to her \nmother and aunt. She has only visited her sister and family in Israel in \n1991, 1994, and 1997. While she has contact with her relatives in Russia \nand her relatives in Israel, that contact is limited. While her niece serves in \n \n11The Appeal Board reversed the Judge\u2019s decision to grant a clearance because of the strict \nrequirements of the Money Memorandum (Applicant in ISCR Case No. 03-04300 had not turned in her \nRussian passport to the Russian government by the close of evidence).   \n \n\n \n \n \n14\n                                                          \nthe Israeli military, she has limited contact with her. Clearly, she put her \ninterests in the U.S. ahead of her loyalty to her elderly mother when she \nchose to renounce her Russian citizenship. \n \nGiven her long history with her employer since April 2000, it is unlikely that \nshe could be exploited by coercive or non-coercive means by the \ngovernment in Russia or in Israel in a way that could force Applicant to \nchoose between loyalty to her mother, aunt, father-in-law, her sibling and \nfamily and her loyalty to the United States. She stated that should any \nsuch attempt be made she would immediately contact the appropriate \nU.S. authorities. Thus, any risk of either coercive or non-coercive foreign \nduress or influence on Applicant and/or her immediate family would \nappear to be slight and clearly manageable. Contacts with citizens of other \ncountries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an \nindividual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure \nthrough threats against those foreign relatives. \n \n \nWhile clearance decisions are inherently based on numerous facts, and as such \nare made after a case-by-case analysis, it is beyond debate that the applicant in ISCR \nCase No. 03-04300 had more significant connections to Russia than the Applicant does \nto the PRC in this case. Whereas, the applicant\u2019s connections to the United States in \nISCR Case No. 03-04300 and in this case are similar.12  \n \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of her connections to PRC, and to the \nUnited States, I conclude Applicant has carried her burden of fully mitigating the foreign \ninfluence security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors\u201d13 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because \nher brother lives in the PRC. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \n \n \n12In ISCR Case No. 03-04300 the applicant\u2019s connections to the U.S. are as follows:  (1) the \napplicant\u2019s husband and son live in the United States, and they are both dual citizens of Russia and the \nU.S.; and (2) The applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1989.  The applicant in ISCR Case No. 03-04300 is \na professional with post-doctorate teaching employment. \n \n13See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n \n15\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on October 6,\n2006. On January 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 19, 2008. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on April 8, 2008, and the hearing was held on May 28, 2008. At the\nhearing, three exhibits (GE 1 through 3) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and submitted nine exhibits. (AE A-\nAE I) In the time allowed for Applicant to furnish additional documentation, he submitted\nAE J, AE K, and AE L. AE J is additional documentation relating to student loans\nJuly 31, 2008\n\n2\naddressed in SOR 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. AE K contains additional documentation relating\nto the student loans, and a restructuring/refinancing of a new loan to accommodate four\nnew classes. AE L includes payoff documentation relating to a delinquent student loan\naccount identified in SOR 1.e. DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the\nproceedings on June 5, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the eight delinquent financial accounts under the paragraph 1.\nHe denied falsifying his security clearance application (SCA) he submitted on October\n6, 2006. Applicant is 43 years old, and married with two children. Applicant retired from\nthe United States (U.S.) Army in 2004 after 22 years of service. He has been working\nfor his current employer as a contract administrator since November 2007. He seeks a\nsecurity clearance.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe SOR lists eight delinquent debts. The eighth account (SOR 1.h.) has not\nbeen included in the total past due amount as the debt was released in December 2002,\nmore than five years ago. Minus SOR 1.h., Applicant is responsible for $26,461.00 in\ndelinquent debt to seven creditors. Applicant was unable to point to any financial\nhardship that prevented him from paying his debts. (Tr. 54-56)\n\" 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c., student loans (approximately $22,000.00). The first three\ndelinquent accounts in the SOR are related to the same student loan funding source.\nThe three accounts were charged off in November 2005. Applicant believed the\naccounts were in deferment when he retired from the military in 2004. No\ndocumentation was provided to establish official postponement of repayment of the\nloans. Applicant has been paying $200.00 a month since May 2007 on the delinquent\naccounts. (AE A, AE J)\n\" 1.d., student loan ($709.00). Applicant enrolled in a class in 2003 that was\nsupposed to be paid through his military education benefits. He paid the bill off in May\n2007. (AE E)\n\" 1.e., military loan ($3,318.00). Applicant testified he was on active duty, and\nwas paying this bill through allotment. It is not clear how the allotment expired when\nApplicant retired in 2004. Applicant has been making documented payments of $200.00\na month on the account since August 2007; the balance on May 2, 2008, was $1633.00.\n(AE E, AE L) \n\" 1.f. health bill ($145.00). The account was not paid through Applicant\u2019s military\nhealth insurance as required. He paid the bill on May 1, 2007. (AE F) \n\n3\n\" 1.g., telephone bill ($123.00). Applicant paid the phone bill on May 20, 2008\n(Tr. 43). At the hearing, he produced a carbon copy of check #480 that he had written\non May 20, 2008, in full satisfaction of the debt.\n\" 1.h., state tax lien ($1,183.00) Applicant testified he purchased a car in 1995.\nThe record is not clear how Applicant\u2019s purchase of the car resulted in him owing the\nstate taxes. Applicant provided documentation verifying the lien was removed on\nDecember 31, 2002. Hence, this account is not included with the other delinquent debts\nas it was resolved more than five years ago. Applicant\u2019s repayment of SOR creditors\n1.d., 1.f., and 1.g. and periodic partial payments of the other four creditors leave\nApplicant with an outstanding delinquent balance of approximately $22,729.00.00.\nPersonal Conduct\nOn October 6, 2006, Applicant intentionally falsified his SCA when he answered\nquestion 28.a. (debts over 180 days delinquent in last 7 years) and question 28.b. (over\n90 days delinquent on any debt) in the negative. As noted earlier, in his answer to the\nSOR in February 2008, Applicant denied he falsified his SCA. At the hearing, Applicant\nexplained, \u201cSir, as I alluded to you earlier, during that time I was going through what\nwas a divorce. And I really cannot answer why. I was embarrassed. I didn\u2019t want to\nadmit to that. I think I really - - I don\u2019t know why.\u201d (Tr. 55) \nApplicant was asked about any additional omissions in the SCA. He indicated\nthat the negative answer to question 23.a. (charge or conviction of a felony offense) was\nincorrect. At the time he was filling out the SCA he had forgotten about the battery\ncharge (he was charged in about 1998) lodged by his former wife. The charges were\ndropped. Also, his negative response to question 24.a. (since age 16 or in the last 7\nyears, have you ever used a controlled substance?) was also incorrect. Applicant\nentered the \u201cNo\u201d answer because he was embarrassed to acknowledge he had used\ndrugs before. (Tr. 61) To be like his friends, he used marijuana about 18 months before\nfiling out the SCA. Applicant still associates with these friends. \nApplicant did not provide any evidence regarding his job performance and/or his\ncharacter on or away from the job. He entered the U.S. Army in 1983, and was\ndischarged in 2004. His highest rank in the Army was Captain. He has a Bachelors\ndegree in Business.\nApplicant never received financial counseling, but did receive assistance on how\nto manage his finances better. He has no set budget. His current monthly net income is\nabout $5,000.00; his monthly remainder after payment of all expenses, is approximately\n$3,321.00. He has about $4,000.00 in his savings account. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nA person who does not live within their means is at risk of engaging in illegal acts\nto generate funds. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nDeliberately concealing information during the course of a security investigation\ndemonstrates dishonesty while representing a serious security concern.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nApplicant still owes approximately $22,729.00 on four delinquent debts, after\nrepayment of creditors 1d., 1f., and 1.g. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history not meeting financial\nobligations) \nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) I am unable to apply this guideline\nbecause the debts became delinquent within the last three years. Though only four\ndebts are still delinquent currently, the amount of the delinquency is more than\n$22,500.00. More importantly, Applicant tried to conceal his indebtedness in October\n2006, giving the impression he had no debt at all. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control and individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\ndoes not apply because Applicant indicated there were no problems preventing him\nfrom paying his debts. While FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) provides limited mitigation because some of the debt has\nbeen paid. However, it is not enough to overcome the adverse evidence under FC DC\n19.a. and 19.c. \nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) receives some consideration because Applicant paid off\nthree of the smaller accounts, and has made a year\u2019s worth of payments on the three\nstudent loans. Also, he has been paying on the military loan since August 2007.\nHowever, he has only paid about $3,700.00 on the four past due accounts. He still owes\nmore than $22,500.00. Having weighed all the evidence, Applicant\u2019s repayment efforts\nfall short of meeting his ultimate burden of persuasion under the FC guideline. \n\n6\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d answers to both debt questions (28.a., 28.b.) of his SCA in\nOctober 2006 were deliberate falsifications of relevant facts as defined by PC DC 16.a.\n(deliberate omission, falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire used to determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness)\nApplicant knew that he was concealing information when he entered his \u201cNo\u201d answers\non the form. Applicant continued to deny the debts in his answer to the SOR in February\n2008. Even during the initial portion of the hearing, Applicant waffled about why he\nfalsified the SCA regarding his past due debt. His credibility is undermined even further\nwith his revelation of omitting his criminal charge of battery (question 23.a. of the SCA)\nand his marijuana use about 18 months before he filled out the SCA. See, response to\nquestion 24.a., SCA dated October 6, 2006. \nI have carefully considered the following mitigating conditions to determine\nwhether Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions are mitigated: PC MC 17.a. (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) \nPC MC 17. a. does not apply because Applicant did not disclose the falsification\nuntil after he was confronted at the hearing about his \u201cNo\u201d answers to both questions on\nthe security form. PC MC 17.b. (the offense was so minor, or such time passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) does not apply as Applicant attempted to conceal seven debts less\nthan two years ago. Finally, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) applies in part as\nApplicant admitted he deliberately omitted his debts from the form. However, he has not\npresented any independent, mitigating character evidence to confidently conclude his\n\n7\ndishonesty is unlikely to recur. In sum, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation does not\nsatisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion under the PC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have weighed the circumstances of this case under the general factors of the\nwhole person concept. Applicant was 41 when he certified to the government in October\n2006 that he had no delinquent accounts. In May 2007, Applicant began paying $200.00\na month on the student loans in SOR 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c., and paid off the student loan\naccount identified in SOR 1.e. Yet, in his February 2008 answer to the SOR, he denied\nthat he deliberately omitted the financial information from his SCA. At the hearing, he\ndid not immediately come forward with his omissions until after initially trying to\nperpetuate the dishonesty. Applicant does not successfully establish his case under the\nFC guideline because there is no evidence of counseling and/or the financial tools\nnecessary to maintain control over his finances. Given Applicant\u2019s failure to come\nforward with his intentional falsifications before being confronted with his falsehoods,\nand the absence of independent character evidence, the FC and PC guidelines are\nfound against him. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 29, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested her case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on April 23, 2008. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on April 24, 2008.  \nThe record is not clear as to when Applicant received the FORM. She submitted a \nresponse to FORM on May 26, 2008. On May 29, 2008, Department Counsel did not \nobject to Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. The FORM was assigned to me on June 9, \nJune 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admits to the allegations in her Answer to the SOR. (Item 4.) \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  She has been employed with the defense contractor \nsince January 2005. She was widowed in 1999 and has two children and four \nstepchildren. They are all adults. (Item 5.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed two delinquent accounts \nconsisting of a $5,552 collection account placed for collection in May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; \nItem 6 at 5-6; Item 7 at 2; Item 9 at 7); and a $8,859 automobile account placed for \ncollection in October 2003. Applciant co-signed a car loan for her daughter. (SOR \u00b6 1.b; \nItem 6 at 5, 7; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 12; Response to FORM, dated May 26, \n2008.) \n \nIn response to interrogatories, dated December 18, 2007, Applicant indicated \nthat she attempted to make payment arrangements with the creditors of the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Neither creditor was willing to negotiate with her. She provided \nevidence that she resolved a delinquent $315 cell phone account. (Item 6 at 11-14.) \nShe also showed that she is current on her electric bill which used to be delinquent. \n(Item 6 at 9-10.) Applicant submitted a personal financial statement which showed that \nher net monthly income is $1,962.64.  Her total monthly expenses are $2,094.59 which \nleaves a monthly balance of negative $131.95. (Item 6 at 4.)  \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant indicates that she is making payments \ntowards the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a to the collection agency who is handling the \naccount. She agreed to pay $50 a month plus give the company her income tax return \nuntil the debt is paid. She made a payment of $1,062 in February 2008 and a $50 \npayment in April 2008 and May 2008. Her balance is now $4,452.93. She states that it \nmight take a couple years to settle the account. Once this account is paid, she intends \nto start paying on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Item 4; Response to FORM, dated \nMay 26, 2008.) Applicant was unemployed between August 2004 and September 2004. \n(Item 5 at 13.)        \n \nApplicant states that she is an honest, hard working person. She does not try to \n\u201ckeep up with the Joneses.\u201d She lives in a 1974 mobile home. She is trying to make \nends meet by doing an honest days work. (Item 4.) She would never jeopardize her job. \n(Response to FORM, dated May 26,2008.)  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant had several delinquent debts \nthat she has been unable to resolve based on her income. The largest debt is an \nautomobile loan where she agreed to act as co-signer for her daughter who defaulted \non the loan payments.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable \nbecause Applicant\u2019s attempt to resolve her delinquent accounts is recent.    \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant was widowed in 1999 \nwhich more than likely created some financial hardship. In addition, she was \nunemployed for one month in August 2004. Applicant never fully explained how she \nencountered her financial problems. One can argue that her daughter\u2019s failure to meet \nthe terms of her automobile loan was not within Applicant\u2019s control as well. Applicant \ndoes not appear to live beyond her means. She is paying what she can towards her \ndelinquent accounts and has acted responsibly under the circumstances.    \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling. She has taken steps to resolve her financial situation.  She satisfied two \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndebts that were not alleged in the SOR.  She is making payments towards the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a.  Applicant entered into a payment plan and has been making payments towards \nthis debt. She agreed to sign over all of her tax returns and pay $50 per month until the \ndebt is paid off. The balance has been reduced from $5,552 to $4452.93.  While one \nunresolved delinquent account remains, Applicant is not the primary debtor on the debt \nthat remains unresolved. Her daughter has primary responsibility for this automobile \nloan.  While as co-signer, Applicant is legally responsible for this debt, she should not \nbe penalized for her daughter\u2019s financial irresponsibility. While Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is very tight, she does not appear to live beyond her means. She is making a \ngood-faith effort to resolve her debts.      \n \n \nUnder the revised AG, the overall concern under financial considerations is not \nonly whether a person who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds, but also the failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  Although Applicant struggles financially, she has taken steps to meet her \nfinancial obligations. Her financial problems are controllable. Her financial situation does \nnot raise a security concern. She has mitigated the security concerns raised under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant paid two delinquent debts \nprior to the SOR being issued. Only two delinquent accounts remain. She entered into a \nrepayment agreement pertaining to one debt. She is meeting the terms of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nrepayment agreement. The remaining debt is for an automobile which she acted as co-\nsigner. Applicant intends to resolve that debt when she completes the payment plan for \nthe first debt. Based on her financial situation, this is a reasonable approach. Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 10, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 25, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey-\nAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.     \nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\n\nThe Judge\u2019s statement about validation apparently refers to confusion in Applicant\u2019s testimony.  \u201cQ:  And when\n1\ndid you validate it to go back?

Transcript at 43.    \nis vulnerable to foreign influence due to his close relationships with family members in Iran renders\nher decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:  Applicant, who is 51 years of age,\nemigrated to the United States from Iran as a young man.  Applicant is now an American citizen.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, who is from another country, has applied for American citizenship, and their\nchildren are native-born U.S. citizens.  Applicant has an Iranian passport, which he has used to visit\nIran for family reasons.  The passport is currently invalid.\nApplicant has family members in Iran and contacts them about once a month.  He contacts\nan uncle about once every two months and corresponds with a nephew by e-mail.  Applicant has sent\nmoney to his family in Iran when there has been need.  He believes the total he has given does not\nexceed $10,000.  \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified as to Applicant\u2019s expertise in his field and his excellent job\nperformance, and a neighbor wrote a letter as to Applicant\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness.  \nIran does not have diplomatic relations with the United States.  Iran supports and is involved\nin international terrorism; it supports violent opposition to the Middle East peace process.  Iran is\nattempting to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  Iran has a dismal\nhuman rights record, and corruption is rampant at all levels of the Iranian government.\nIn his appeal, Applicant lists nine items in the Judge\u2019s decision which he considers to be\nfactual errors.  He argues that the Judge placed too much weight on his relationship with family\nmembers in Iran and not enough on his ties to the United States, and that the Judge\u2019s decision is\ntherefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nOnly one of the nine items listed by Applicant is an error of fact.  The Judge stated that\nApplicant validated his Iranian passport before each of his trips to Iran, when in reality he did so for\nonly one of the trips.   Applicant used his Iranian passport for his trips, but he only needed to renew\n1\nit once, since it was current when he next traveled to Iran.  Accordingly, the error is harmless, since\nit is unlikely, considering the decision as a whole, that Judge would have reached a different result\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1.\n2\nTranscript at 42-43.\n3\nin the absence of the error. \nApplicant objects to the conclusion on page 7 of the Judge\u2019s decision that Applicant is a dual\ncitizen of Iran and the United States.  He states that there is no evidence that he is a citizen of any\nother country.  Applicant\u2019s assertion on this point has mixed merit.   Resolution of this claim of error\nis complicated by the fact that the Judge concluded, \u201cThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the\nUnited States\u201d but did so without explanation.  The record evidence establishes that Applicant\nexercised Iranian citizenship through the use of an Iranian passport after he obtained U.S. citizenship\nin 1990, and there is record evidence that Iran currently considers Applicant a citizen of Iran by\noperation of Iranian law.  However, there is no record evidence that Applicant, either through\nstatements or deeds, currently holds himself out as a dual citizen of the United States and Iran.  \nIn support of her argument that there is sufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran, Department Counsel points to Applicant\u2019s\naffirmative answer to Section 8, Item d of his December 4, 2006 security clearance application.2\nHowever, that portion of the application asks if Applicant is or was a dual citizen of the United\nStates and another country.  There is no additional evidence that sheds light on what Applicant was\nindicating when he answered the question.  Therefore, the answer does not provide clear evidence\nto support a conclusion that Applicant considered himself a dual citizen at the time he completed the\napplication.  Department Counsel also points to Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony, wherein he discusses\ndual citizenship solely in the context of maintaining an Iranian passport.  Applicant stated only that\nit was his belief that Iran considered him a dual citizen because he held an Iranian passport and\nvalidated it for use to make trips to Iran.   Applicant last used his Iranian passport in 2005 and it has\n3\nsince expired.  Applicant\u2019s testimony established only that he used his Iranian passport in the past,\nand that it was his belief that his continuing status as an Iranian citizen in the eyes of the Iranians was\nbased upon his holding of an Iranian passport, albeit an expired one.  Applicant also testified that\nhe had no intention of revalidating his Iranian passport, and at no point in the record did he indicate\nthat he considers himself an Iranian citizen independent of his understanding of the viewpoint of the\nIranian government.\nThe fact that the Iranian government considers Applicant an Iranian citizen has some security\nsignificance in the context of this case.  However, that factor is different from a situation where\nApplicant continues to use a valid Iranian passport or otherwise voluntarily holds himself out as a\ndual citizen of the U.S. and Iran.  The Judge\u2019s declaration of Applicant as a dual citizen is therefore\nproblematic inasmuch as she does not inform as to what \u201cdual citizen\u201d means with reference to this\nApplicant or how the concept of dual citizenship shapes the Judge\u2019s analysis in the overall context\nof the case under Guideline B.  While remanding the case to the Judge would remedy these\ndeficiencies, the Board concludes that remand is unnecessary inasmuch as there is other record\nevidence that supports the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision.           \nApplicant also complains on appeal that the Judge employed the wrong standard when\n\nDecision at 7.\n4\nassessing the security significance of his family ties to Iran.  Applicant points out that Guideline B\nspeaks in terms of foreign contacts creating a \u201cheightened risk\u201dof foreign exploitation or coercion.\nApplicant then focuses on the following passage from the Judge\u2019s decision: \u201cIt does not go\nunrecognized that for the past thirty years he has worked hard to establish himself as a responsible,\neducated, American citizen.  However, he has not cut all ties from Iran.\u201d   Applicant asserts the\n4\npossibility that a person may well not cut all ties from his former country without the remaining ties\nresulting in heightened risk.\nApplicant\u2019s argument is not a frivolous one.  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s statement about\nties to the former country implies or asserts that any such ties automatically create a situation of\nheightened risk, that statement is error.  Obviously, the nature and strength of those ties is  important\nin an accurate assessment of the overall risk, and there is no requirement under the Directive that an\napplicant sever all ties with a foreign country before he or she can be granted access to classified\ninformation.  Individual statements or portions of a Judge\u2019s decision are not reviewed in isolation,\nhowever.  The entire decision must be considered when making a determination of the harmfulness\nof the error.  After reviewing the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board concludes that the statement about\ncutting all ties was not a critical component in the Judge\u2019s overall assessment of the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  Likewise, the Board is convinced, after reviewing pertinent\nparts of the Judge\u2019s analysis, that she employed the correct standard when evaluating Applicant\u2019s\nconnections to Iran.  \nApplicant\u2019s other allegations of error pertain to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant is\nvulnerable to foreign influence due to his close relationships with family members in Iran.  Applicant\nargues that the Judge placed too much weight on those relationships.  After reviewing the record,\nthe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on substantial evidence or are reasonable\ncharacterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified any\nharmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record as a whole, the\nJudge\u2019s findings as to Applicant\u2019s close ties with family in Iran are central to her overall analysis of\nthe case and, with the exception of the harmless errors discussed above, are sustainable.          \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to mitigate those concerns.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant argues that he presented\nenough mitigating evidence in terms of his ties to the United States that the Judge should have\ngranted him a clearance.  The Judge found some evidence of mitigation.  However, that alone did\nnot compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence,\nor an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05809 at 2 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008).   \nAfter reviewing the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\n\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

While remanding the case to the Judge would remedy these deficiencies, the Board concludes that remand is unnecessary inasmuch as there is other record evidence that supports the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision. Applicant also complains on appeal that the Judge employed the wrong standard when Decision at 7. 4 assessing the security significance of his family ties to Iran. Applicant points out that Guideline B speaks in terms of foreign contacts creating a \u201cheightened risk\u201dof foreign exploitation or coercion. Applicant then focuses on the following passage from the Judge\u2019s decision: \u201cIt does not go unrecognized that for the past thirty years he has worked hard to establish himself as a responsible, educated, American citizen. However, he has not cut all ties from Iran.\u201d Applicant asserts the 4 possibility that a person may well not cut all ties from his former country without the remaining ties resulting in heightened risk. Applicant\u2019s argument is not a frivolous one. To the extent that the Judge\u2019s statement about ties to the former country implies or asserts that any such ties automatically create a situation of heightened risk, that statement is error. Obviously, the nature and strength of those ties is important in an accurate assessment of the overall risk, and there is no requirement under the Directive that an applicant sever all ties with a foreign country before he or she can be granted access to classified information. Individual statements or portions of a Judge\u2019s decision are not reviewed in isolation, however. The entire decision must be considered when making a determination of the harmfulness of the error. After reviewing the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board concludes that the statement about cutting all ties was not a critical component in the Judge\u2019s overall assessment of the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline B.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJune 25, 2008 \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(eQip), on December 4, 2006.  On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on February 6, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on April 25, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 2, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for May 28, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\nthree exhibits.  The Applicant called one witness, presented three exhibits and testified\n\n2\non his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 11, 2008.  Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Iran.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 10).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 51 years of age and has a Bachelor\u2019s\nDegree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed as an Engineer for a defense\ncontractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Iran in 1957.  He immigrated to the United States in\nJanuary 1979, and started attending college that same year.  In 1984/1985 he married\nan Irish citizen who possesses an Irish passport.  She recently initiated her application\nfor United States citizenship.  They have two children who are native born American\ncitizens.  The Applicant became a United States citizen in June 1990.  He possesses an\nIranian passport that was issue to him in June 2001.  Although his Iranian passport\nbecame invalid, he validated it each time he traveled to Iran.  In April 2001, he validated\nhis Iranian passport in order to travel to Iran to see his father who was ill.  In 2005, when\nhis mother passed away, he again traveled to Iran using his Iranian passport.  A copy of\nthis Iranian passport indicates that it is currently invalid.  (Government Exhibit 3). \nThe Applicant\u2019s father passed away two months before the hearing.  Prior to his\ndeath, he was a retired government railroad worker, who received a government\npension.  With respect to whether he will travel to Iran again, the Applicant stated, \u201c No.\nIt is not obligatory.  I may just again to pay a visit to my father\u2019s grave this time, but it is\nnot - - I don\u2019t have a passport; so, I guess I can\u2019t.\u201d  (Tr. pp. 43).  When asked whether\nhe had any intentions of validating his Iranian passport, he stated, \u201cNot at this time, no\u201d.\n(Tr. p. 44).    \n\n3\nThe Applicant has a sister, nephew and uncle who reside in and are citizens of\nIran.  The Applicant and his sister grew up close, but he cannot say for sure how close\nhe is to her now.  He contacts his family in Iran about once a month to see how they\nand are doing.  His sister is a homemaker who is supported by her husband, who is also\na government railroad worker.  They have one child, the Applicant\u2019s nephew, who\nrecently moved back in with his mother.  His nephew is about 29/30 years old and is in\nbusiness for himself, but the Applicant is not sure what he does.  He recently purchased\na computer and is now corresponding with the Applicant by e-mail.  The Applicant is\nconsidering sponsoring his nephew to come to the United States.  (Tr. p. 54).  The\nApplicant\u2019s uncle is a retired government civil engineer who traveled from Iran to the\nUnited States for the Applicant\u2019s wedding.  He and the Applicant are in contact with\neach other about every two months or so.  Each of these family members know that the\nApplicant is an Engineer but they do not know where he works or what he does.\n \nOver the years, the Applicant has occasionally sent money to his family in Iran\nfor emergency purposes, such as to cover the expense of his parents\u2019 funerals.  (Tr. p.\n47).  He has also sent money when he feels his family in Iran is in need.  At times, he\nhas sent between $1,000.00 and $2,000.00 to his sister by way of a friend who may be\ntraveling to Iran who can get the money for her when they arrive in Iran and then the\nApplicant reimburses them.  The purpose for this process is to avoid the problem of the\nrestriction on how much money can be brought into the country.  The Applicant believes\nthat since he has been living in the United States, he has sent no more than $10,000.00\nto his family in Iran.  When his mother died, the Applicant gave all of his rights of\ninheritance in Iran to his sister.  (Tr. p.  46).\nBesides his children, the Applicant has no relatives in the United States.  (Tr. p.\n56).  His net worth in the United States is approximately $700,00.00.  He is involved in\nthe community, and has volunteered as coach for his daughter\u2019s club soccer team.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nWith respect to his Irish family members, besides his spouse, he has a mother-\nin-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law who are Irish citizens.  His sister-in-law lives in\nFrance, and his brother-in-law lives in England.  The Applicant\u2019s wife has contact with\nher mother in Ireland, and her sister in France about every other week.  She contacts\nher brother in England about once a month.  The Applicant\u2019s other sister-in-law resides\nin the United States and was for several years, a private nurse for a United States\ndignitary.  The Applicant\u2019s father-in-law has passed away.\nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who has known the Applicant for thirteen years and\nmanaged him for the last eight years, testified that the Applicant is a leading Engineer in\nthe field who has successfully held a security clearance for about ten years.  His\nexpertise is critical, and his skill is very hard to find in the industry.  He is reliable,\nprovides excellent analysis, and is willing to share his knowledge with other Engineers.\nHe has never committed a security violation.  Out of sixteen employees, he is ranked in\nthe top four.  (Tr. pp. 22-29)  \n\n4\nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for 2006, 2007, and 2008 reflect that\nthe Applicant\u2019s overall rating always \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d.   (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s neighbor for the past eleven years indicates that the\nApplicant is trustworthy and responsible.  On a number of occasions the neighbor has\nasked the Applicant to watch over their home while they are away.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nC).\nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Iran.  The\nfact that Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States, Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire\nnuclear weapons and other weapon of mass destruction, its support for and involvement\nin international terrorism, it\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace\nprocess, and it\u2019s dismal human rights records.  I have considered the fact that Iranian\nGovernment officials at all levels commit serious abuses of their power and authority.\nIt\u2019s Totalitarian Government, the fact that Iran supports terrorists activities, and is\nrampant with crime and instability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Iran,\nthe human rights abuses, and the government corruption elevates the cause for\nconcern in the case.  The United States may face no greater challenge from a single\ncountry than from Iran.    \nThe Government presented no evidence on the current political conditions in\nIreland.  Accordingly, I find that the foreign contacts the Applicant has in Ireland do not\npose a security risk.  \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\n\n5\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign connections may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the\nApplicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to\nthat of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \n \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\n\n7\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies in this\ncase.  None of the mitigation conditions are applicable. \nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States. His wife and her\nfamily are citizens of Ireland.  Besides his two children who are United States citizens,\nthe Applicant has no family in the United States.  However, he has significant ties of\naffection in Iran.  His sister, nephew and uncle are citizens and residents of Iran with\nwhom he maintains a close and continuing relationship. Although he does not want to\nadmit it, the Applicant is very close to his family in Iran.  The Applicant has deep and\nabiding ties in Iran.  His only sister, with whom he grew up, is very special to him.  His\nnephew is also special to him as he is considering sponsoring him to come to the United\nStates, which is not an easy task.  He is also very close to his uncle, his father\u2019s brother.\nHe contacts his sister, nephew or uncle at least once a month or so by telephone and\nmost recently receives e-mail from his nephew.  He sends them money when they need\nit.  There is strong evidence of a close bond and affection.  After becoming a United\nStates citizen, he traveled to Iran using his Iranian passport on two occasions for family\nmatters.  It does not go unrecognized that for the past thirty years he has worked hard\nto establish himself as a responsible, educated, American citizen.  However, he has not\ncut all ties from Iran.    \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Iran elevates the cause for concern\nin this case.  Although there is no direct evidence that his family members in Iran are\nassociated in any way with the Iranian government, there is evidence of a close bond\nand strong evidence of affection with his family in Iran.  This bond and affection with his\nfamily could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, the possibility of foreign\ninfluence exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise\nof classified information.  I find that the Applicant is  vulnerable to foreign influence.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.e.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.f.:  Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.g.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.h.: For the Applicant\n \n DECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Her husband was injured in a motorcycle accident in 2001 and was unable to work for six\nmonths.  Later, in 2006, he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.  He is currently receiving social\nsecurity disability benefits.  In addition to her husband\u2019s medical problems, Applicant was laid off\nfrom her job in 2004.  She received unemployment benefits and attended college, receiving an\nassociates degree in 2006.\nApplicant has unpaid delinquent debts which have arisen since her second discharge in\nbankruptcy.  These debts are for medical bills, home repairs, an auto repossession, and other debts\nowed to banks, to a power company, etc.  Additionally, Applicant\u2019s home was foreclosed in 2001\nand in the same year she pled guilty to issuing a bad check.  Applicant has not sought credit\ncounseling for her financial problems.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\n\n3\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nOne of the allegations in the SOR refers to a charged-off debt to a bank in the amount of\n$674.  Applicant admitted this debt in her response to the SOR.  Item 2.  Applicant also\nacknowledged this debt in her response to interrogatories submitted to her by DOHA.  Item 6. \nHowever, the Judge  stated in her decision that, despite Applicant\u2019s admissions, \u201cgiven the lack of\nevidence as to the existence of this debt, this allegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.\u201d  Decision at\n3.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that this finding is erroneous.  The Government\u2019s burden\nof producing evidence arises only in regard to SOR facts that the Applicant has controverted.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.  The Government has no such burden when an applicant admits the facts.  In\nthis case, Applicant has not controverted the debt in question.  It was error, therefore, for the Judge\nto conclude that the Government had failed to meet a burden which the Directive does not impose\nupon it.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.19 c): \u201ca history of not\n1\nmeeting financial obligations[.]\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n2\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separaton),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(e): \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\n3\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions taken to resolve the issue.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008 ) (Applicant offered no independent witnesses and\n4\nprovided no documented proof which would substantiate her claim that her debts were not legitimate or that she had\ntaken reasonable steps to resolve them).  \n4\n2006).\nThe Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised security concerns under Guideline\nF.   She went on to conclude that Applicant had met her burden of persuasion as to mitigation,\n1\nspecifically under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FCMC) 20(b).   Department\n2\nCounsel persuasively argues that this conclusion was error, in light of contrary of record evidence.\nFor example, Department Counsel points to record evidence that Applicant and her husband took\na vacation to Aruba in 2005.  This vacation appears to have coincided with a period of time in which\nboth were unemployed.  This raises serious questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment in regard to her\ndebts, in that she appears to have used funds on the vacation that could better have been expended\non debt reduction.   The Board notes that Applicant chose to have the case decided upon the written\nrecord, with the  result that her credibility could not be evaluated in the context of a hearing.  See\nISCR Case No. 08-00899 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2008).  Furthermore, Applicant did not reply to the\nFile of Relevant Material, nor did she submit a reply brief on appeal.  As a consequence, there is\nnothing in the record to address questions arising out of the trip.  Indeed, the record contains a\npaucity of evidence demonstrating that Applicant has acted responsibly in regard to her delinquent\ndebts.  In light of that, the Judge\u2019s favorable application of FCMC 20(b) is not sustainable.  For\nsimilar reasons the record will not sustain the Judge\u2019s partial application of FCMC 20(e),  in that\n3\nthere is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s past due debts are not legitimate.\nNeither is there documentary evidence of positive steps Applicant has taken to resolve any alleged\ndispute.   Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable application of the mitigating conditions is erroneous.\n4\nLikewise, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis also cannot be sustained, due to lack of\nevidence.  As stated above, it is an applicant\u2019s responsibility to demonstrate that he or she should\nhave a security clearance.  Under the facts of this case, the security concerns implicit in Applicant\u2019s\nbankruptcies in 1992 and 2000, her conviction for bouncing a check, her home foreclosure in 2001,\nand her numerous delinquent debts have not been mitigated simply by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her\nresponse to the SOR or her answers to interrogatories.  There is little in the record to demonstrate\nthat Applicant has made a reasonable effort to pay off her debts or that she has otherwise acted\nresponsibly in regard to them.  The Board takes special note of the Judge\u2019s finding that there is no\n\n5\nevidence in the record explaining Applicant\u2019s two bankruptcy actions.  Taken together, and viewed\nin light of her subsequent financial history, they  raise serious questions about Applicant\u2019s judgement\nand reliability.  The record as a whole does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met her\nburden of persuasion under the Egan standard.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the record will\nnot sustain the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On March 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 15, 2008\n\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR, dated April 14, 2008).\n1\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application) at 1, 3.\n2\nItem 7 (Copy of 2000 Bankruptcy court docket sheet); Item 8 (Copy of 1991 Bankruptcy court docket sheet).\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 28, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 14, 2008, and requested a decision on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on May 7, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on May 12,\n2008. She had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material\nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not respond or submit additional\nevidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on July 7, 2008. The government submitted\neight exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-8 and admitted into the record.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, and 1.j-1p of the SOR, some with explanations. She denied\nthe factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.q of the SOR. She also provided additional\ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.1\nApplicant, who is 39 years old, works as a composition specialist for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. She began her employment in May 2006 and\ncompleted her security clearance application (SF-86) shortly thereafter.2\nIn November 1991, Applicant and her husband filed a petition for bankruptcy\nunder Chapter 7, and the court discharged their debts on March 25, 1992. Applicant and\nher husband again filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 on May 25, 2000, and\nthe court discharged their debts on September 14, 2000. The record contains no\nevidence as to why Applicant and her husband filed for bankruptcy on these two\noccasions.3\nWithin one year of her 2000 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant and her husband\nbegan to experience financial problems. Her husband sustained serious injuries in a\nmotorcycle accident in September 2001 and was unable to work for at least six months.\nAlthough she took a second job, Applicant was unable to meet their monthly expenses,\nwhich included medical bills, a car payment and the mortgage. As a result, the\nmortgage company foreclosed on their house and the bank repossessed their car. The\nmortgage company received sufficient money from the foreclosure sale to satisfy the\nloan on Applicant\u2019s house. The bank sold the repossessed car in 2001, but did not\nreceive sufficient funds to satisfy the loan. Applicant has not paid anything on this seven\nyear old debt with a remaining balance of $11,296. (SOR \u00b6 1.m) In 2001, Applicant\nwrote a check and asked the payee to hold the check for a week. Instead the payee\n\nItem 3, supra note 2, at 10; Item 5 (Credit report, dated September 20, 2006) at 9; Item 6 (Financial\n4\ninterrogatories and answers) at 3.\nItem 3, supra note 2, at 2-5; Item 6, supra note 4, at 4, 5, 7.\n5\nItem 6, supra note 4, at 6-7.\n6\nItem 4 (Credit report, dated November 2, 2007); Item 5, supra note 4.\n7\nId.; Item 2, supra note 2.\n8\n3\ncashed the checked and the police charged her with writing a bad check. She paid\nrestitution.4\nIn August 2004, Applicant\u2019s employer of six years laid her off. She received\nunemployment and began attending a technical college from which she graduated with\nan associates degree in 2006. In January 2005, her husband stopped working for health\nreasons. In March 2006, medical doctors diagnosed him with Myotonic Muscular\nDystrophy, Type 2. He applied for social security disability benefits and currently\nreceives $953 a month in disability benefits. He uses a wheel chair when needed.5\nApplicant earns $2,162 a month in gross income and $1,756 in net income. With\nher husband\u2019s social security benefit, their total household net income is approximately\n$2,709 a month. Their monthly expenses for rent, food, utilities, car expenses, medical\nexpenses, student loans, two credit accounts, and miscellaneous expenses totals\n$2,615, leaving approximately $94 a month to pay old debts. She drives a 1998 vehicle\nand her husband has a 1996 vehicle. Both vehicles are loan free. With the exception of\n$251 in unpaid medical bills, Applicant and her husband have lived within their financial\nmeans for the last five years.  She timely pays her current bills and limits her credit\ndebt.6\nApplicant\u2019s $251 in medical bills are approximately two years old and not paid.\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) Applicant challenged the $1,996 gas bill, but has not provided\ndocumented evidence of her challenge to the gas company. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) She did\nprovide copies of pictures documenting a gas leak problem, which caused the high bill.\nThe credit card debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f is not listed in either credit report in the record.\nEven though Applicant admitted the debt, given the lack of evidence as to the existence\nof this debt, this allegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n7\nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g -1.l total $3,657. All of these debts are between\nfive and seven years old. They are not paid, nor has Applicant challenged the validity of\nthe debts. Applicant has not consulted with a credit counseling service about her debts.8\nThe remaining SOR allegations are evidentiary factors discussed above, which I\nmust consider in making my decision.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between about 2000 and 2001. The record reflects that Applicant\nhas a long history of debt problems, which continues to the present. Her current bills are\npaid, but finances remain tight. Although she is prudently managing her resources,\nthere is some likelihood that problems might occur in the future. The evidence is\ninsufficient for this potentially mitigating condition to apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s latest\nfinancial problems arose when her husband sustained significant injuries in a\nmotorcycle accident and could not work for more than six months. Two years after he\nreturned to work, her employer laid her off. Six months later, her husband stopped\nworking permanently for health reasons. He now receives social security disability\nbenefits because he is totally disabled from working due to Myotonic Muscular\nDystrophy. During her husband\u2019s recovery from the motorcycle accident, Applicant\nworked a second job, but still could not earn enough money to pay their living expenses.\nSubsequent to her lay-off, Applicant returned to school to develop new skills which\nwould increase her earning capabilities. She is now employed, and with her husband\u2019s\ndisability benefit, they are able to pay the monthly household expenses.  Applicant\n\nA  State Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of\n9\nlimitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate\nactivity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human\naffairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable\ngoal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations\nprovide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be\nha[led] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage\nplaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our\njudicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\n6\nacted reasonably under the circumstances in which she found herself. This mitigating\ncondition applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling, nor has she\nmade a good faith effort to resolve these debts either by payment or settlement. For the\nlast five years, Applicant has managed her household income. She keeps current on\nher monthly bills. She lives frugally. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions\nhave minimal application.\nIf \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d, mitigation\nmay be established under AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant indicates that she routinely talked with\nthe gas company about a gas leak problem in the property she was renting and\nprovided evidence of a problem. However, she has not provided documented evidence\nof her contacts with the gas company and the results of these conversation as it relates\nto her unpaid gas bill in SOR \u00b6 1.e. This mitigating condition has some applicability as to\nthis debt.\nShe also receives some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the\napplication of the State\u2019s 4-year statute of limitations, which applies to all the debts\nlisted in the SOR except the debts in allegations 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.n to 1.q.\nUnder State law, the creditors are time barred from collecting these debts See State\nCode. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2725 and 5525.  Elimination of these delinquent debts through the\n9\nstatute of limitations has ended her potential vulnerability to improper financial\ninducements related to these debts as she no longer has any legal responsibility for\nthese debts. The fact that these debts are very old and not collectible under state law\ndoes not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding debts, a factor I must\nconsider.  \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began\nat least 20 years ago. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) Nine years after the bankruptcy court\ndischarged the debts of she and her husband, they again filed for bankruptcy protection.\nThe reason for their second bankruptcy, other than excessive spending, are unknown.\nOne year after their second bankruptcy discharge, the mortgage company foreclosed on\ntheir house and the bank repossessed their car. These major financial negatives\noccurred not because of simple financial mismanagement and overspending, but as a\nresult of unexpected income loss beyond their control. Their inability to pay these bills\nreflects that Applicant and her husband\u2019s expenses equaled their income. Thus, they\nhad not yet learned how to live conservatively and manage their finances in a manner\nwhich would not cause financial disaster if problems developed. \nApplicant\u2019s debts problems began in 2001 when her husband sustained serious\ninjuries in a motor cycle accident and did not work for more than six months. Not only\ndid he lose income, but he incurred medical expenses, which are paid.  The loss of his\nincome caused severe financial problems with their budget, even though she worked a\nsecond job. Apart from the car repossession debt, their unpaid debt from this period of\ntime totals about $5,600 including the gas leak problem. These debts arose following a\nsix-month loss of household income. Recovery from such an income loss takes time.\nFor Applicant, her ability to fully recover financially from her husband\u2019s injuries was\nderailed when she lost her job in 2004.  Six months later, her husband\u2019s health forced\nhim to quit working permanently, leaving him without income for at least 18 months. He\nnow receives social security disability benefits, which are significantly below his\nprevious income level. These factors made it impossible for Applicant and her husband\nto repay old debts. To their credit, they managed to pay their monthly expenses and not\n\n8\nincur significant additional debts. Their unpaid debts from 2004 forward amount to $251.\nApplicant returned to school to develop additional skills which would enhance her\nearning power, but, as most individuals, she used loans to pay for her education. The\nmonthly payment on her school loan debt is over $500, which she timely pays each\nmonth.\nApplicant has undergone significant behavioral changes. In regards to fiscal\nmanagement, she and her husband they have developed a budget which they follow.\nThey live more frugally, as shown by the very old cars they own and limited credit card\nspending. They timely pay their current bills. She has not been able to pay her old debts\nand currently lacks the resources to pay most of the debts, except the outstanding $251\nin medical bills. Her old debts were never reduced to a judgment and the Statute of\nLimitations has expired, making these debts uncollectible. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Thus,\nthese debt cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is\nnot simply whether all her debts are paidBit is whether her financial circumstances raise\nconcerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. For a long time, Applicant and\nher husband lived beyond their monthly income. Twice they used legal means to\nresolve their financial problems. While they have not have paid their debts incurred\nwhen her husband was injured, which is the majority of her unpaid debt, she never\nresorted to illegal activities to raise money to pay these debts. Rather, she learned to\nmanage her limited finances and curtailed her spending habits. She changed her\nlifestyle. Even though her old debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise security\nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.q:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from his delinquent\nfederal income taxes and other debts that remain owing.  \nOn April 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted an answer to the SOR, dated May 7, 2008, in which he admitted all SOR\nallegations and requested a clearance decision based on the written record.  \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 20, 2008.\nApplicant was informed he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections\nthereto or any additional information he wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged\nreceipt of the FORM on June 9, 2008. He did not submit a response to the FORM or object\nto anything contained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case was assigned\nto me on August 19, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old single man who has been employed as a senior technical\nsupport engineer by a defense contractor since April 2005. He worked for several\nemployers outside the defense industry as either a CAD support engineer or designer from\nApril 1992 to August 1999, December 2003 to April 2004, and April 2004 to April 2005. He\nwas self-employed as a CAD designer from August 1999 to November 2003.\nFederal tax liens were filed against Applicant by the IRS in April 2004, and\nSeptember 2005, totalling $31,735. No payment is reported to have been made toward\neither of these liens. Applicant submitted a letter from an attorney, dated December 26,\n2007, who claimed he was working on setting up a repayment plan with the IRS that\n\u201cshould be approved and in place within approximately three to four weeks.\u201d (GE 6). The\nattorney also stated in that letter \u201cI will provide you with confirmation of the payment plan\nonce I receive same from the IRS.\u201d (GE 6) The FORM does not contain any information\nto indicate Applicant has been successful in negotiating a repayment plan with the IRS. \nThe SOR alleges three accounts, totalling $76,412, that are listed as past due in\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports. In his response to financial interrogatories sent to him by DOHA\nin December 2007, Applicant stated these accounts were \u201cPending.\u201d (GE 6) The FORM\ndoes not contain any information to indicate any payment has been made on any of these\ndebts.\nThe SOR alleges four accounts, totalling $43,800, that have been submitted for\ncollection. In his response to the December 2007 DOHA interrogatories, Applicant claimed\none account he owed in the amount of $8,444 had been \u201cSettled in full\u201d and the other three\naccounts were \u201cPending.\u201d (GE 6) The account Applicant claimed to have satisfied was still\nlisted in his credit report, dated May 19, 2008, as a collection account with a past due\namount of $8,440. The FORM does not contain any other information to indicate any\npayment has been made on any of these debts.  \nApplicant retained an attorney sometime in or about mid-2005 to assist him in\nresolving his financial problems. According to the correspondence contained in the FORM\nfrom the attorney, Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose as a result of his self-employment\nand failure to have taxes withheld from the monies that were paid to him. Additionally, the\nattorney indicates Applicant was unable to make ends meet on the income he was\ngenerating and found it necessary to use credit cards to pay his living expenses. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n3\nApplicant\u2019s attorney wrote that Applicant chose to not seek bankruptcy protection\nbut instead intends to satisfy all his delinquent creditors by prioritizing the claims and\nmaking what payments he can afford. Applicant satisfied a state tax lien in the amount of\n$8,118 that was filed in March 2004 and released in August 2006. Additionally, an account\nApplicant owed in the amount of $6,840 that was listed in the December 2007 DOHA\ninterrogatories was satisfied sometime before May 2007. \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n10\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant failed to pay federal income taxes and tax liens, totalling $31,735, were\nfiled against him in 2004 and 2005. No payment has been made to satisfy those liens and\nthey remain of record. Additionally, Applicant has seven delinquent accounts, totalling\n$120,212, that have either been submitted for collection or are listed as past due in his\ncredit reports. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his attempt at self-employment, his\nlacking the funds to pay taxes as they came due, and his need to use credit cards to pay\nhis living expenses. Applicant has now consulted with an attorney in an effort to resolve his\nfinancial problems, and, with the assistance of the attorney, he has satisfied a state tax lien\nand at least one other creditor. However, the vast majority of his delinquent debt remains\noutstanding and there is nothing of record that would indicate it will be resolved in the near\nfuture. \nHaving made the decision to work for himself without first providing for the financial\nresources to support himself and pay taxes as they came due, Applicant is not entitled to\napplication of Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\nWhile Applicant has sought the assistance of an attorney, there is nothing in the\nrecord that indicates his financial problems are under control. To the contrary, although the\nattorney\u2019s letter indicated Applicant should have had a repayment plan in place with the\nIRS at least six months ago, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant has\n\n5\nbeen successful in negotiating such a plan. Accordingly, MC 20(c): the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem in being resolved or is under control does not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s attorney wrote that Applicant decided against seeking bankruptcy\nprotection and instead has chosen to prioritize his creditors and repay them when and as\nhe is able. To that end, he has satisfied a state tax lien and another delinquent creditor.\nThus, Applicant is entitled to application of MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. However, considering the\nhuge amount of delinquent debt that remains outstanding and the lack of any information\nin the record to indicate Applicant has made any payment toward his delinquent debt in at\nleast the past year, application of this mitigating condition is limited and insufficient to\novercome the overwhelming negative financial concerns that remain.\n    \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions.\nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns caused by the financial considerations that are present in this case. He\nhas not overcome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                            \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government also submitted a Government\u2019s Exhibit \nList, which was marked as Exhibit (Ex.) I. Applicant did not offer any exhibits, and \ntestified on her own behalf. I held the record open until August 29, 2008 to afford the \nApplicant an opportunity to submit additional material. The Applicant did not submit any \npost-hearing materials. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 2, \n2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.d., 1.f., 1.h., 1.j. \u2013 1.o., and 1.q. She denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.g., 1.i., and 1.p. She claimed the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g. was \nthe same debt as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Her admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old contract analyst, who has worked for her defense \ncontractor employer since October 2004. She is a first time applicant for a security \nclearance. GE 1, Tr. 12-14.  \n \nApplicant finished the 10th grade, and was awarded a GED in October 1998. She \nestimates she has earned 20 college credit hours, and hopes to earn a bachelor of \nscience degree in business. GE 1, Tr. 15-16. Applicant has never married and has a 15-\nyear-old son. She is the sole source of support for her son. Her son\u2019s father is in prison \nand is not eligible for parole until 2031. GE 1, Tr. 12-13, 23. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded among other things the review of her September 2006 e-QIP, her November \n2007 Signed Response to Interrogatories and Attachments, and her April 2008 Credit \nBureau Report. GE 1 \u2013 3. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR listed 17 different line items, consisting of ten collection \naccounts, three charged off accounts, two judgments, an allegation of failing to file her \n2004 federal income tax return and being assessed $3,180 in delinquent taxes, and an \nallegation of being financially incapable of paying her debts as evidenced by a personal \nfinancial statement showing a net monthly remainder of -$29.42. The total amount for \n16 debts alleged is approximately $25,228.  \n \nApplicant stated she paid, does not owe, or otherwise resolved the debts she \ndenied, identified supra. Applicant stated that she has filed her income returns since \n2005 and that the Internal Revenue Service has been recouping her 2004 tax liability \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthrough subsequent refunds owed her. GE 2, Tr. 42-46, 56-58. Applicant did not provide \nany documentation during her hearing or post-hearing supporting her position that the \ndebts she denied have been resolved. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s November 2007 Response to Interrogatories and Attachments, she \nstated in part: \n \nAs far as my financial status I am currently still in the red. Last year my \ncousin [name of cousin] passed away and we are in the process of selling \nher house, it has been sold but we are still wrapped up in the final steps \nbefore we receive the actual payment, you may wonder why I am even \ntelling you this . . . but once we (my grandmother) has received the check \nshe is giving a substantial amount to me. With this money I will be able to \npay ALL of my DEBT!!! This is very exciting to me because I hate owing \nmoney to anyone. I currently work and pay the bills that are more important \nfor my day to day living taking care of my family which are; rent, car, \nelectric, phone, water things of that nature, not including putting gas in the \ncar (which continues to rise, God Bless our Economy) and not to mention \nbuying groceries! I do the best I can with what I have and sometimes it is \njust like the saying . . . rob Peter to pay Paul! I know that on paper I \nprobably don\u2019t shine in the best light but having bad credit doesn\u2019t make me \na bad person it is just the situation that I am in. GE 2. \n \nIn response to Department Counsel\u2019s query how she got into debt, Applicant \nstated: \n \nOkay. I have always worked. I had my son at a really young age, and from \nthe time that he was probably two I have worked to take care of him the \nbest that I can. And there is usually not a lot of services for working \nparents. If you make too much, you don\u2019t get assistance, so I have always \nheld a job down.  \n \nBut my main concern has always been to pay the bills that are necessary, \nlike rent and electric and day care. If I had a debt, when I got extra money, \nas like taxes or something, I got a gift, I would always try to take care of \nthings that weren\u2019t like a monthly bill to me.  \n \nWhen I was 18, I stupidly accepted a lot of credit cards that weren\u2019t \u2013 I \nshouldn\u2019t have taken. They were $200 credit cards, but now I owe \nthousands \u2013 you know, $1,000 on a credit card I never should have taken. \nI honestly didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand, at that point in my life, what I was \ngetting into. And because of my education, I never really had a good job. \n \nI moved from [state A] to [state B], and I got a job at the [state agency in \nstate B], and that was my first professional job. In that job, I started at \n$6.37, but it was a job, and it was the right thing to do. And I moved up, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nand when I left there I didn\u2019t make a lot of money. Even to this day, I\u2019m \nmaking $39,000, and that\u2019s not a lot of money after taxes and everything \nelse. You figure you have \u2013 gas costs $50, $60 a week, and to me that is \na lot of money. \n \nSo I look at \u2013 I look at today, and I say I need to pay rent, so I have a roof \nto give \u2013 to put over my son\u2019s head, and make sure there is food in the \nhouse for him to eat, electric for him to, you know, turn on, water is \nrunning. Those are the necessity bills to me. If I ever get an opportunity to \nhave extra money, I would pay those things off. But right now, that\u2019s just \nnot in a situation or a position that I\u2019m in. \n \nI recently decided that I was going to file bankruptcy and have paid for \nthat, to file in September, because I feel that\u2019s the only way that I\u2019m going \nto actually get a fair start, a fresh start, to give myself a better chance.  \n \nAt the job that I have now, I recently got a promotion, which was very nice, \nand it put me at $39,000 a year. It has the potential to go further. And with \na security clearance, it will give my boss the trust that she already has in \nme, but she\u2019ll have the Government backing \u2013 saying that I\u2019m a \ntrustworthy person, and she\u2019ll be able to teach me more things, so that I \ncan advance.  \n \nAnd the way I look at that is my salary won\u2019t decrease, it will increase in \nyear from now. And after \u2013 not that I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m \nskipping out on not paying bills, but if I just get a chance to actually get a \nfair start that I feel like I never really had in my life, then I\u2019ll have a place to \nstart from. \n \nAnd now that I know what I\u2019m supposed to do, and how to do it correctly, \nI\u2019ll have that chance. And this is how I feel I can get it. Tr. 24-26. \n \nApplicant\u2019s strategy to resolve her indebtedness is to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nShe stated she has retained a bankruptcy attorney, paid his retainer fee, but still had to \npay the $199 filing fee, which she planned to do by September 10, 2008. She stated her \nbankruptcy attorney was going to file her bankruptcy petition on September 15, 2008. \nTr. 28-29. Applicant also stated she signed up to meet with a financial planner on \nSeptember 30, 2008 to learn how to make a budget and assist her in financial planning. \nTr. 47. \n \nApplicant did not submit any employee performance evaluations, reference \nletters or character evidence. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 18, the Government\u2019s concern is that an Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or \ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligations that has been \nongoing since she was 18 years old, a period of approximately 12 years. Although she \nclaims six of her debts have been resolved, she failed to submit any documentation \nsupporting her assertions. Even if what Applicant claims is completely accurate, she has \nten unpaid debts. She failed to file her 2004 federal income tax return, and has a \nnegative net monthly remainder.  \n \nApplicant hopes to include the majority of her debts in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \nyet to be filed. For these debts, her financial recovery plan is prospective in nature. \nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations; and FC DC \u00b6 19(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same; apply in this case.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,1 I conclude that Applicant is unable \nto receive credit under any of the potential Financial Considerations Mitigating \nConditions (FC MC), which would include FC MC \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; FC MC \n20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, and FC MC \n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been ongoing. She has either not paid or \nbeen unable to pay her debts. For those debts she claims have been resolved, she has \nnot provided documentation substantiating her claims. Applicant presented minimal or \nno evidence documenting efforts taken to contact or resolve debts with her unpaid \ncreditors. Although she stated she has financial counseling scheduled, it as well as her \npending bankruptcy, are prospective in nature. Assuming Applicant successfully \n \n1  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncompletes the bankruptcy process, time will tell whether she will reach a state of \nfinancial stability.  \n \nShe presented no evidence to show she has dealt responsibly with her financial \nobligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, credible payment plans). Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack \nof favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility, or that she has taken control of her financial situation. Based on \nher past performance, her prospective assurances ring hollow. Her financial problems \nare likely to be a concern in the future. Moreover, her financial problems are recent, not \nisolated, and ongoing.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \ndifficulties.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.q.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant is a 35-year-old aerospace engineer employed with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the defense contractor since June 2007. From 1999-2007, he worked for a previous defense contractor. He was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering in 1994. He currently is studying for his Masters in Engineering Management.

Badami, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on April 24, 2007.  He submitted an additional e-QIP on July 10, 2007, after he \nchanged employment. On October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 13, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nDecember 12, 2007. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nDecember 20, 2008. On January 2, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling \nthe hearing for January 31, 2008. On January 28, 2008, the case was transferred to me. \nThe hearing was held on January 31, 2008. The Government offered Government \nFebruary 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibits (Gov) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel \ncalled three witnesses, including the Applicant, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A \nthrough F, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nhearing on February 11, 2008. The record closed on that date. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 13, 2007, Applicant admitted to all \nthe SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old aerospace engineer employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor since June 2007. From 1999-2007, he worked for a previous \ndefense contractor. He was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering \nin 1994. He currently is studying for his Masters in Engineering Management. From \n1995 to 1997, he served in the Peace Corps. He is married and has no children. (Tr at \n22-24, 81; Gov 2; AE A.)   \n \nIn March 2003, Applicant was visiting a friend during Mardi Gras.  He went out \nduring the day, and when he returned, he discovered that his friend invited a few people \nover.  A casual buffet was set up in the kitchen. Among the items were fresh baked \ncookies. Applicant ate some of the cookies. After he ate the cookies, he was told that \nthere was marijuana in the cookies.  Some time later, as he walked by the cookies, he \ngrabbed another cookie. He ate part of the cookie but stopped himself thinking \u201cif you \nwant a cookie so badly, find one that doesn\u2019t have drugs in it.\u201d He later felt some effects \nfrom the marijuana. (Tr at 91-92; Answer to SOR.)  Applicant no longer associates with \nanyone who was at the party. (Tr at 92.) \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant and his wife (then fianc\u00e9e) spent a ski weekend with \nseveral friends at a friend\u2019s cabin.  One of their friends stated that she was going to try \nmarijuana for the first time. His wife decided that she would try marijuana for the first \ntime as well.  Applicant decided to do it too.  The marijuana was baked in corn bread \nwhich was served with dinner.  Both Applicant and his wife had a terrible experience. \nThey both became sick and agreed that they would never do it again. (Tr at 26-27, 92-\n94, Answer to SOR.) \n \nOn April 24, 2007, Applicant submitted an e-QIP application to his previous \nemployer.  The request was for a National Agency Check (NAC), not a request for a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr at 66-67, 102; Response to SOR.) He answered \u201cNo,\u201d in \nresponse to question 21a on the application which asks: \u201cIn the last year, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, \nhashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, \netc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d (Gov 1.) He admits that he understood the question and \nwas aware that he should have listed his February 2007 marijuana use. He rationalized \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthat the question was not looking for someone who tried it one time, and was not going \nto use it again but for regular users of illegal drugs. (Tr at 117-120.)  When signing the \ndocument, he certified that \u201cMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are \ntrue, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in \ngood faith. I understand a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be \npunished by fine or imprisonment or both.\u201d (Gov 1, Signature Forms.)  \n     \nIn June 2007, Applicant accepted a job with his current employer.  Shortly after \nhe started his new job, he was asked to fill out a new e-QIP application in order to apply \nfor a SECRET security clearance. Question 24a on the application asks: \u201c Since the age \nof 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, \nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroine, \netc.), \namphetamines, \ndepressants \n(barbituates, \nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription \ndrugs?\u201d  In response to this question, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d and listed his March \n2003 and February 2007 marijuana use. (Gov 2.) \n \nBefore submitting the second e-QIP application, he had a discussion with his \nwife. They had recently got engaged. He told her that he intended to list his drug use on \nthis current form. He told her that he omitted his drug use on the last form, and by listing \nit on the current form there could be trouble. (Tr at 122-123.) Applicant thought the \nsecond questionnaire would supersede the prior questionnaire.   \n \nApplicant and his wife have not used marijuana since the February 2007 incident. \nNeither intends to use marijuana again. They have told their friends that they cannot be \npresent when marijuana is used. They have not been present while people were using \nmarijuana since February 2007. He is willing to submit to random drug tests. (Tr at 25, \n28, 101-102, 132.)  In his response to the SOR, Applicant submitted a signed \nstatement, dated November 8, 2007, indicating that he intends to refrain from drug \nabuse now and in the future.  Should he fail to refrain from any and all drug abuse, he \nexpects the automatic and immediate revocation of any and all security clearances he \nmay possess. (Tr at 96-100; Response to SOR.)  \n \nApplicant states that he will never use marijuana again because: \u201cI have too \nmuch at risk. My relationship, you know, with my wife, my career. I\u2019m hoping to have a \nfamily soon.  All of this would be put at risk by such a stupid move as to try marijuana \nagain.\u201d (Tr at 101-102.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s second level supervisor, Mr. W., testified that he has known Applicant \nsince 1999.  They first were co-workers. Mr. W. was recently promoted. He indicates \nthat Applicant is an important part of the division\u2019s leadership and technical team.  He \nnotes that Applicant is a first rate engineer who is honest and trustworthy.  He is aware \nof the all of the allegations in the SOR. He first learned from his superiors because \nApplicant had previously informed them. In early January 2008,   Applicant personally \napproached him and told him of the allegations. He does not condone Applicant\u2019s \nconduct, and believes he should have known better. He discussed this with Applicant. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHowever, he acknowledges that Applicant voluntarily told the truth when he filled out his \nsecond e-QIP application. Applicant assured him that this conduct will not be repeated \nand he believes him. Applicant has offered to take a drug test at any time that is \nrequested of him.  He strongly endorses his application for a security clearance. (Tr at \n45-75; AE E.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance report indicates that Applicant \u201chas proven \nto be exceptionally competent in his assigned duties. He demonstrates a high level of \nexpertise and is relied upon by the customer to keep the procedure development \nprocess on schedule to meet the Projects milestones. He excels in promoting team \nefforts and works well across operational boundaries . . . He is a valued asset to the \n[company\u2019s] engineering team.\u201d (AE B.) Applicant\u2019s past performance evaluations with \nprevious employers have been favorable. To summarize, he either met or exceeded \nstandards in past performance evaluations. He has also received several awards \nthroughout his career. (AE F.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) & 25(a) (any drug \nabuse) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. He illegally used marijuana on two occasions. The \nfirst occasion was in March 2003. The second occasion was in February 2007.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Two apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Drug \nInvolvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) applies. The record evidence indicates that Applicant used marijuana on two \nseparate and isolated occasions.  Although the last use occurred in February 2007, a \nyear has passed. Although, Applicant did not use the best judgment when he decided to \nuse marijuana, there is no evidence he is a habitual user. Applicant and his wife are \nadamant that they will never use marijuana again. Applicant has learned a difficult \nlesson pertaining to his marijuana use and future use is not likely to recur.  \n \n \nThe second mitigating condition that applies is FC MC & 26(b) (a demonstrated \nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using \n\n \n6 \n \n \nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with \nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation.) Applicant does not intend to use \nmarijuana ever again. He and his wife have told their friends that they can longer be \npresent when marijuana is used. They have not observed illegal drug use since the \nFebruary 2007 incident.  He has not used marijuana since the February 2007 incident.  \nHis two time use of marijuana was experimental.  He is not a habitual user.  He \nsubmitted a statement with his response to the SOR, indicating his intentions to refrain \nfrom future illegal drug use. He acknowledges that if he is caught using illegal drugs in \nthe future that it will result in his automatic revocation of his security clearance.  \nApplicant has taken sufficient steps demonstrating that he does not intend to abuse any \ndrugs in the future.  Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThere are specific disqualifying conditions which may be raised. Applicant\u2019s \ndeliberate omission of his February 2007 marijuana use in response to question 21a on \nhis April 24, 2007, e-QIP application raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \n(PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities).  Applicant admits he deliberately omitted his February 2007 marijuana \nuse in response to question 21a.  Although he rationalized to himself why he did not \nhave to list the marijuana use on the application, it was a deliberate omission.  He \nunderstood the question.  Although this was his first time filling out an e-QIP application, \nApplicant is a college-educated aerospace engineer.   \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \n\n \n7 \n \n \nservice or other group) applies with respect to subparagraph 1. Applicant\u2019s concealment \nof his marijuana use made him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation or duress.    \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern may be mitigated.  Personal Conduct Mitigating \nCondition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) applies.  \nApplicant fully disclosed his marijuana use on his second e-QIP application, which was \nsubmitted a little over two months after his first e-QIP application.  Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse was not discovered through a third party. He was not confronted about his \nmarijuana use during a security clearance background investigation.  He disclosed his \nmarijuana use on his second application because he knew it was the right thing to do.    \nWhen he accepted his new position, he was required to submit a new e-QIP application \nfor a security clearance. It is unlikely the Government would have discovered \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use had he not disclosed it.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) applies.  Applicant fully disclosed \nhis past marijuana use on his July 10, 2007, security clearance application.  He also \nfully disclosed his past marijuana use to his wife and work supervisors.  He is no longer \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress due to his past marijuana use. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although Applicant was a mature \nadult during the time each of the SOR allegations occurred, he accepted full \nresponsibility for his actions and made no excuses for his behavior. Although his last \nuse of marijuana occurred a little over a year ago, his use was experimental. It is \nunlikely that he will use marijuana again. He understands that future illegal drug use will \nresult in the automatic revocation of his security clearance. He understands the severity \nof his earlier omission on his security clearance application.  He is well respected in his \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfield and he fully disclosed his SOR issues to his chain of command, even though he \nwas not required to do so.  \n \nWhile the Applicant\u2019s past conduct justified the concerns raised under Drug \nInvolvement and Personal Conduct, he has met his burden of mitigating the security \nconcerns arising under these guidelines. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She denied having any financial\ndifficulties in her clearance application and in a previous security questionnaire. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nApplicant submitted her electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(SF 86), on August 29, 2006. On November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E.  The action was taken under Executive\n1\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\nApril 25, 2008\n\nItem 4.\n2\nThe government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 5.\n4\nItem 4 at 5.\n5\n2\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 5, 2007, and requested that\nher case be decided by an Administrative Judge on the written record without a\nhearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 9,\n2\n2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to\n3\nApplicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging\nreceipt of her copy of the FORM on January 16, 2008, and returned it to DOHA. She\nprovided no further response to the FORM within the 30-day period she was given to do\nso, did not request additional time to respond, and made no objection to consideration\nof any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 27, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has no prior\nmilitary service, and has never held a security clearance. She never married, and has\ntwo daughters, ages 20 and 19. She was fired from a job she had held for five years in\nJune 2003, and was unemployed until October 2004 when she started her present job.\nShe also began working a second job in April 2006.4\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 5, 2007, Applicant admitted the truth\nof all factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.s. Her admissions are corroborated by\nthe credit bureau reports (CBRs) in Items 7 and 8 of the FORM, and are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. She also admitted, with explanations, to submitting false\nanswers relating to her financial history on her 2006 SF 86, and on the Public Trust\nPosition Application (SF 85P) that she submitted on December 1, 2004. She further\nstated, \u201cI am off work for the next two months for medical Plus I am in more debt\nbecause I get no pay for two months and my insurance did not cover most of my\nmedical bills. [sic]\u201d Her only statement of her intent to address these debts was, \u201cI will\ndo my best to straight [sic] out my debts as soon as I get back on my feet.\u201d5\nThe 19 delinquent debts listed in the SOR, to which Applicant admits, total\n$36,633. Some became delinquent as long ago as 2000, some as recently as 2006, and\nsome in each year in between. Applicant was fired in June 2003 for missing too much\nwork, and unemployed for the next 15 months. However, her delinquencies both pre-\nand post-date this period of unemployment, and she did not specifically attribute any of\n\nItem 7 at 2; Item 8 at 4, 6, 11, 12. \n6\n3\nthem to this time. She offered no evidence that would support application of any\nfinancial consideration mitigating condition, either in terms of resolving or disputing\nthese debts, or by seeking counseling or other assistance.\nApplicant also admitted to providing false answers on security clearance and\ntrustworthiness determination questionnaires as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d. In\nher 2006 SF 86, she denied having any property repossessed in the last 7 years. In her\nAnswer, she stated that she had forgotten about a vehicle repossession that occurred in\n2000, not earlier in 2006 as alleged in the SOR. The FORM contains no direct evidence\nconcerning this repossession, but the two CBRs reflect an auto loan debt in collections\nthat first became delinquent in 2000, and no such delinquencies arising in 2006. In fact,\nshe completed paying off another auto loan \u201cas agreed\u201d in June 2006.  Accordingly,\n6\nthere is not substantial evidence supporting the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nApplicant explained her false answers denying 90-day delinquent debts on that\nSF 86, and denying 180-day delinquent debts on that form and her 2004 SF 85P, by\nstating that she \u201cjust glanced over the questions.\u201d However, she certified the accuracy\nof her answers by signing each form immediately below the acknowledgment that willful\nfalse answers could subject her to criminal penalties, and provided substantial detailed\ninformation in response to other questions on each form. \nApplicant provided no other evidence of good character, trustworthiness or\njudgment for consideration in mitigation. Since she elected a determination on the\nwritten record, no in-person evaluation of her character or credibility was possible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\n\n4\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant number and amount of\ndelinquent debts over the past eight years. She was either unable or unwilling to repay\nthese debts, and provided no information that repayment of any of them is probable in\nthe foreseeable future. Applicant demonstrated no effort to resolve any of her $36,633\nof proven delinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\n\n5\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination and balancing of resulting\nsecurity concerns with any potentially mitigating matters.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nissues have been a continuing problem since at least 2000. Her disregard of these\nfinancial obligations is ongoing, and continues to raise concerns about her current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence does not support this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquencies arose on a regular basis, with new delinquent debt reported in every year\nsince 2000. These delinquencies preceded and followed her 15-month period of\nunemployment after being fired for missing work, with no evidence of recent responsible\naction to address them. This potentially mitigating condition is not supported as a factor\nfor significant consideration in this case. \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant neither asserted nor provided evidence of either of\nthese conditions. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nApplicant has made minimal, if any, effort to address or resolve the delinquent\ndebts established by the Government, even after receiving notice of the security\nconcerns raised by these issues. This supports the inference that she remains\nfinancially overextended and, therefore, at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. It further indicates a lack of judgment and unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, thereby raising substantial questions about her reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n6\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in the SOR and raised by the evidence\nin this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant provided false denials concerning her lengthy and extensive history of\nfinancial delinquencies in response to two questions on her 2006 SF 86, and one\nquestion on her 2004 SF 85P. She certified the completeness and accuracy of her\nanswers on each form, acknowledging the obligation to be truthful. Her explanation that\nshe, \u201cjust glanced over the question,\u201d in each case is unpersuasive. The weight of\nevidence in this record leads to the conclusion that her false responses to these three\nquestions were deliberate. Applicant made no assertion of any personal conduct\nmitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 17, and the evidence does not raise any of them.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for her choices and conduct. She provided no information to show that\nany of these debts arose due to circumstances largely beyond her control. Applicant\n\n7\nhas been employed for all but 15 months of the period that these debts became\ndelinquent, but has resolved none of them, and continues incurring additional debt she\ncannot afford to repay. There is no evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral\nchange. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of answers seeking disclosure of these debts on security\nquestionnaires not only represents dishonesty and disregard for security concerns, but\nalso demonstrates her susceptibility to pressure concerning their revelation. She\nsubmitted no evidence demonstrating that risk of coercion or duress is not significant.\nHer ongoing disregard of lawful obligations, especially after receiving notice of the\nsecurity concerns raised thereby, creates continuing doubt about her trustworthiness\nand reliability. She offered no other evidence to mitigate these concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations and\npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86, on \nFebruary 21, 2007. On May 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOn July 9, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. On July 31, \n2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for August 26, 2008. The \ncase was heard on that date. The Government offered three exhibits which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 3. Applicant testified and offered seven \nexhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - G. The record was held \nopen for two weeks to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. He timely \nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmitted a 24-page document that was admitted as AE H without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission is marked as \nHearing Exhibit 1. The transcript was received on September 12, 2008.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, \nand 1.k. He denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m.  \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old administrator employed with a Department of Defense \ncontractor seeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his company since 1999. \nHe has two more semesters until he earns a bachelor\u2019s degree.  He is a retired Air \nForce Master Sergeant. He retired in February 1999 after 24 years of active duty \nservice. He has held a SECRET clearance for 35 years. He has a part-time job at an Air \nForce lodging facility. He is married and has one daughter, age 37. (Tr at 4-7, 19; Gov \n1; Gov 2 at 10; AE B at 2-3; AE D.)  \n \nOn February 21, 2007, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP), in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1.) A \nsubsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had 13 delinquent \naccounts, an approximate total balance of $37,516.  The delinquent accounts included:  \na $1,500 credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1 at 26; AE G); a $7,519 credit card \naccount that was charged off in January 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 3 at 4); a \n$757 account charged off in April 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 3 at 4, 15; AE H at \n8, 10); a $19,521 credit card account placed for collection in December 2002 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 3 at 6, 14; AE F); a $356 car repair account placed for collection \nin July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 3 at 11, 15; AE A at 9); a $72 debt placed for \ncollection in December 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 12, 24, 25; Gov 3 at 15; AE H at 15); \na $94 insurance debt placed for collection in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 12, 26; \nGov 3 at 15); a $6,367 credit card account placed for collection in January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h: Gov 3 at 16); a $416 bank debt placed for collection in April 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 2 \nat 23; Gov 3 at 16); a $165 satellite television account placed for collection in December \n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 2 at 24; AE A at 8, 33); a $250 cable television debt placed for \ncollection in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 2 at 25; AE A at 8, 34); a $404 telephone \naccount placed for collection in January 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 2 at 24; AE A at 9, 34); \nand a $95 insurance account placed for collection in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 2 at \n25; AE A at 10, 35). \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial troubles began after he retired from the Air Force. His post-\nretirement job only paid him $7 an hour. His wife is unable to work due to rheumatoid \narthritis.  He attends college and hopes to increase his earning potential after receiving \na degree. (Tr at 64; AE 2 at 10; AE E.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn April 25, 2005, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt consolidation \ncompany. He paid them funds and they were to satisfy his debts. In August 2005, he \ncancelled his agreement with the company because he did not think they were making \nprogress towards resolving his debts. (Tr at 27-28; AE H at 17-20; Gov 2 at 12.)  \n \nThe accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $94 (AE H at 21); SOR \u00b6 1.i for $416 (Gov \n2 at 23; AE H at 12-14); SOR \u00b6 1.k for $250 are paid (AE H at 22).  He claims the \naccounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($1,500), and 1.d ($19,521, original balance $7,881) \nwere credit card balances that were charged by his ex-wife without his authorization. \nThey divorced in 1992. He accepts responsibility for the accounts. (Tr at 22-27, 40-44; \nGov 2 at 31; AE F; AE G.)  \n \nIn his post-hearing submission, he indicates the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.h were removed from the credit report. (AE H at 1-2.) These \naccounts are not listed on credit reports submitted by applicant dated July 7, 2008, and \nJuly 8, 2008. (AE A) No information was provided as to why the accounts were removed \nfrom his credit report. He states the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m \nare pending payment. (AE H at 1-2.)    \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $4,506. His monthly expenses \ninclude: $1,034 mortgage; $130 cell phone; $190 car insurance; $244 car payment; $50 \ncable; $40 telephone; $60 gas; $190 electric; $75 water; $12 haircuts; $430 groceries \nand dinner out; $50 clothing; $200 gas. He also makes a $70 monthly credit card \npayment. His total monthly expenses are $2,775. (AE H at 4-5.) After expenses, he has \n$1,731 left over.  He sends his mother approximately $100 a month. He has no savings. \nHe is current on federal income taxes and is not aware of any other delinquent \naccounts. (Tr at 69-70.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Between 2001 to 2008, Applicant \naccumulated approximately $37,516 in delinquent debt. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant continues to have financial problems. His recent debts became delinquent in \n2007 and 2008. The majority of his delinquent accounts remain unresolved.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s 1992 divorce is \nnot a factor in his recent financial problems. Although Applicant struggled financially due \nto low paying jobs when he retired from the military in February 1999, his budget \nreflects that he has $1,731 left over each month after expenses to apply towards his \ndelinquent accounts. He did not begin to resolve the delinquent debts in the SOR until \nprior to the hearing. The majority of the debts remain unresolved. He continued to allow \naccounts to become delinquent in 2007 and 2008. His financial problems appear to \narise from neglect as opposed to an inability to pay. I cannot conclude Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. While Applicant consulted a debt consolidation company in \n2005, there is no evidence that he received financial counseling. Financial counseling \nwould assist Applicant in controlling his finances. Although he paid some accounts, it is \nunlikely that his financial problems will be resolved in the near future due to the extent of \nthe delinquent debt.   \n  \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g, 1.i, and 1.k.  Although Applicant promises to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, \n1.i, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m, a promise to pay in the future does not mitigate the concerns under \nfinancial considerations. Applicant claims the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \n1.h have been removed from his credit report. However, no information is provided \nstating the basis for the removal. There can be a number of reasons for removing an \nitem from a credit report, including removing a debt after seven years of nonpayment. \nThe government established a prima facie case under the financial considerations \nconcern, the burden shifts to Applicant to provide evidence to mitigate the concerns. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient information to mitigate the concerns raised under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

None of the debts have been paid. \nApplicant has not successfully mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 22, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR he elected to have the matter decided \nwithout a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), dated July 30, 2008. The FORM contained eight \nattachments. On August 5, 2008, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along with \nnotice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions. Applicant's response to the FORM was \ndue 30 days after receipt of a copy of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nSeptember 4, 2008. As of September 25, 2008, no response had been received. On \nSeptember 25, 2008, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the $422 state tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nand an $818 bank debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He admitted the $656 school debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h) was \nhis ex-wife\u2019s debt. In his answer, he stated he had gone to court and he and his ex-wife \neach have to pay half of the medical bills.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old electrician who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince August 2000, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance.  \n \nIn November 1998, Applicant sought bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13, \nthe wage earner\u2019s plan, of the bankruptcy code. In his Questionnaire for Sensitive \nPosition dated September 2006 (Item 1), in response to question 27 on his financial \nrecord, Applicant reported his November 1998 bankruptcy. The record is silent as to the \nreason for seeking bankruptcy protection, the creditors listed in the Chapter 13, the \namount of his monthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee, how long the plan lasted, if \nthe plan was dismissed, or discharged.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax return for 2002 was due April 2003. In September 2003, the state \ntax commission issued a tax lien for tax year 2002. In January 2004, a cancellation of \njudgment for the tax lien was issued. (Item 5) The SOR states the tax lien was released \nin January 2004. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant alleges the state tax commission \nissued the lien in error and he has a letter from the state tax commission verifying his \nclaim. (Answer to SOR) No letter was submitted. The FORM and Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer fail to provide any additional information about this tax lien.  \n \nThe SOR lists 15 debts of concern which total approximately $11,000. The \nlargest debt is a car debt ($7,506) listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant asserts he was divorced, the car was granted to his wife, and she \u201clet it go \nback.\u201d No court orders were provided showing any property division.  \n \nAs of January 2008, Applicant\u2019s gross monthly salary was $3,400. His monthly \ndisposable income (gross income less expenses) or remainder was $159. (Item 5) The \n\n \n \n \n3\nfinancial interrogatory (Item 5) directed Applicant to provide documentation verifying \npayment and current status of the delinquent or outstanding debts listed in his Mary \n2007 credit bureau report (CBR). (Item 7) \n \nApplicant was specifically instructed that acceptable documentation included \nrecent statement or vouchers from the creditors, documentation from a credit \nconsolidation institution indicating creditors and payment history, loan applications \nmade in an effort to satisfy debts, documentation from creditors reflecting payment \narrangements or payment plans, and/or bankruptcy records reflecting the delinquent \naccounts are included in bankruptcy.  \n \nNo documentation of any kind was received. Nor was there any documentation \nshowing Applicant was disputing the debts. He admitted the debts and stated a court \nhad directed he and his wife were to each pay half of the medical bills. A copy of the \ndivorce decree or other court order was not provided.  \n \nA summary of the SOR debts of concern follows:  \n \nSOR \n\u00b6 1 \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filed \nNovember 1998. \nUnknown \nUnknown. \nb \nState tax lien released January \n2004.  \n$422 \nReleased. \nc \nBank charge off on credit card.(Item \n7, p.6) \n$818 \nNo documentation \nshowing payment for \nitems c - q. \nd \nCredit card charge off on an auto \nloan.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n \n \n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \n\n \n \n \n6\nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nIn 1998 Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection. He has 15 delinquent or past \ndebts due totaling approximately $11,000, which have been placed for collection or \ncharged off. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nApplicant was informed in the financial interrogatories that he needed to provide \nsufficient documentation to show he had resolved his debts. He was specifically told \nacceptable documentation included: recent statement from the creditors, a credit \nconsolidation institution plan, a consolidation loan, documentation reflecting paying on \nrepayment \nplans, \nand/or \nbankruptcy \nrecords \nreflecting \nthe \ndelinquent. \nNo \ndocumentation was received. Applicant has not disputed the debts. He admitted the \ndebts and stated a court had directed he pay half of the medical bills. A copy of the \ndivorce decree or other court order was not provided.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; [and] \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s 15 debts remain unpaid and are not infrequent. \nThere is no showing the debts were occurred under such circumstances that it is \n\n \n \n \n7\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), ten of the debts totaling $1,266 were for medical debts placed \nfor collection. However, there is no showing the nature of the illness, hospitalization, \ninsurance coverage, or if the debts were incurred due to an unexpected medical \nemergency. The fact the debts are medical debts does not prove the debts were caused \nby conditions largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. AG & 20(b) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c), there is no showing Applicant has attended financial classes, \nmaintains a budget, or is paying his debts. AG & 20(c) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(d), the tax lien was cancelled showing Applicant no longer owes \nthe debt, a debt he denied in his SOR answer. The reason for the lien, or if it was \nmistakenly issued, has not been established. Applicant admits owing the remaining \ndebts in his answer to the SOR, although he infers a portion of the debts are now his \nex-wife\u2019s debts as decreed in his divorce. Even though a copy of the divorce decree \nwas not produced, such divorce decrees are normally binding on Applicant and his ex-\nwife, but have no binding effect on a creditor without the creditor\u2019s consent. Routinely, \nsuch decrees do not relieve either party of liability to the creditor. Should either party fail \nto fulfill the agreement, the creditor could still enforce the debt against the joint maker of \nthe debt who could then look for relief from their noncompliant ex-spouse.  \n \nNo other payments are shown. Evidence of a good-faith effort is lacking. \nApplicant failed to provide documentation supporting payment or repayment \nagreements. AG & 20(d) does not apply. AG & 20(e) does not apply because Applicant \nhas not documented any dispute of the debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant filed for bankruptcy \nprotection in November 1998. Applicant has recently been divorced and has $159 per \nmonth of discretionary income. The debts remain unpaid. There is no showing of credit \ncounseling, or the likelihood the debts will not continue. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nThe amount of debt is not large. The awarding of a security clearance is not a \nonce in a life time occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying \nand mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances \na clearance is not warranted, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to \nreapply for a security clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, \nestablished compliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, \nhe may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a \nclearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Consideration: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a, 1.c -1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1. b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e. She is a 37-year-old principal specialist employed by a defense contractor since April 2007, seeking access to classified information. She previously held a clearance in the mid- 1990s. The SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 6 delinquent debts totaling nearly $21,000. Applicant admits three debts totaling nearly $12,000. The remaining $9,000 delinquent debt was for unpaid child support ($3,000) and defaulted student loans ($6,000). The debt at SOR 1.a. arose around June 2007, when Applicant\u2019s two children (ages 14 and 18), incurred text messaging charges on their cellular telephones that Applicant was unable to pay. Applicant\u2019s older sister paid a proffered settlement amount as a gift to Applicant (Tr. 32, A.E. A). The children are now on a pre-paid cellular plan. The debt at SOR 1.b. arose in early 2007. Applicant\u2019s two children resided with their father until June 2007. Applicant was obligated to pay child support, which she paid directly to her ex-husband. When her ex-husband filed for child support through the state court system, Applicant was unable to document those payments to the state\u2019s satisfaction and she was required to pay through the state court.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 24 March 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF.  Applicant answered the SOR 15 May 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 2 June 2008, and I convened a hearing 17 July 2008. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 25 July 2008.\nJuly 31, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e. She is\na 37-year-old principal specialist employed by a defense contractor since April 2007,\nseeking access to classified information. She previously held a clearance in the mid-\n1990s.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 6 delinquent debts\ntotaling nearly $21,000. Applicant admits three debts totaling nearly $12,000. The\nremaining $9,000 delinquent debt was for unpaid child support ($3,000) and defaulted\nstudent loans ($6,000).\nThe debt at SOR 1.a. arose around June 2007, when Applicant\u2019s two children\n(ages 14 and 18), incurred text messaging charges on their cellular telephones that\nApplicant was unable to pay. Applicant\u2019s older sister paid a proffered settlement amount\nas a gift to Applicant (Tr. 32, A.E. A). The children are now on a pre-paid cellular plan.\nThe debt at SOR 1.b. arose in early 2007. Applicant\u2019s two children resided with\ntheir father until June 2007. Applicant was obligated to pay child support, which she\npaid directly to her ex-husband. When her ex-husband filed for child support through the\nstate court system, Applicant was unable to document those payments to the state\u2019s\nsatisfaction and she was required to pay through the state court. Applicant satisfied this\ndebt in March 2007, with a gift from her mother of half the amount owed (Tr. 36-41, A.E.\nA).\nThe debt at SOR 1.c. arose in May 2005, when Applicant moved from one state\nto another nearby. Applicant thought her land line provider just switched the billing\naddress from one state to the other on the same account, when the provider closed the\nfirst account and opened a new account at the new address. Applicant never received\nthe final bill from the closed account. She paid this bill in July 2007 (Tr. 42-46, A.E. A).\nThe debts at SOR 1.d. and 1.e. are for student loans Applicant took out while\nattending community college from 1998 to 2000. Repayment on the loan was to have\nstarted in 2002, but Applicant obtained a forbearance to 2003 because she was unable\nto make the required payments. However, she was still unable to make the payments\nonce the forbearance expired, and she defaulted on the loans. She took no action with\nthe creditor until April 2007, when her Federal income tax refund for 2006 was seized\nand applied to the outstanding balance. Applicant was then placed in a rehabilitation\nrepayment plan for six months, during which time her payments were deducted\nautomatically from her paycheck. She has now resumed regular payments and is\ncurrent on her educational loans (Tr. 48-54, 68-69, A.E. A).\nThe debt at SOR 1.f. is for an automobile repossession in June 2007. Applicant\nco-signed the loan for her then fianc\u00e9, and thought he was paying the loan through his\npersonal checking account. The first time she knew that he was paying not was when\nthe vehicle was repossessed. She has contacted the creditor to establish a repayment\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nplan, but the creditor is demanding a cash down-payment that is beyond her means.\nShe has offered to pay $100 per month. At present, the creditor is pursuing legal\nrecourse against the ex-fianc\u00e9 (Tr. 54-58, A.E. A).\nApplicant currently lives within her means and does not have any delinquent\naccounts. She attributes her financial difficulties to lower paying employment before she\nobtained her current job in April 2007. She now makes $73,000 per year. She\npreviously made $35,000 per year. Applicant\u2019s work and character references (A.E. B)\nconsider her honest and reliable.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial\n\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n3\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n,\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\ndifficulties dating to at least 2003.  Although Applicant has taken steps to address most\n3\nof her debts, the largest single debt\u2014the joint automobile loan\u2014has not been\naddressed. While she is on firmer financial footing today, she has not reached a stage\nwhere her goal of financial stability seems likely.\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide mixed help to\nApplicant. Her financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  Except for the\n4\neducation loans and the land line bill, the debts arose after she obtained her better\npaying job in April 2007. The land line bill (1.c.) seems largely an issue of\nmiscommunication or oversight, and can be mitigated. The child support debt (1.b.) and\nthe automobile repossession (1.f.) were largely due to circumstances beyond her\ncontrol\u2014setting aside the judgment issues of co-signing the car loan and not keeping\nbetter records of her child support payments. There is a similar judgment issue in not\ninsuring her teenage children understood the limits of the cell phone plan (1.a.). For the\nmost part she has acted responsibly overall in addressing these three debts, although\nthe car loan remains unresolved.  However, I am concerned that the two paid debts\n5\nwere resolved by outright gifts from family members. Beyond that, she was outright\nirresponsible in dealing with her educational loans, taking action only when her income\ntax refund was seized. There is no evidence that Applicant has undertaken financial\ncounseling. She has not demonstrated that the problem has been brought substantially\nunder control.  Except for the education loans, the debts that have been paid were\n6\narguably paid in a timely, good-faith effort.  She appears now to have the means to get\n7\nand keep her financial house in order. Nevertheless, the best case view of Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances is that it is still too early to tell whether her goal of financial stability will\nbe achieved. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

On April 17, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n1The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to the allegations under Guideline J.  The Judge\u2019s findings and\nconclusions under that Guideline are not at issue here.\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July\n20, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law because she failed to apply pertinent mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F and Guideline E.1  For the reasons discussed below, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\ndecision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 50 years old.  Applicant\nserved in the military from 1978 until 1998, during which time he held a security clearance.\nApplicant has worked for his current employer since April 2004 in a position which requires a\nclearance.  Applicant was married to his first wife from 1985 until 1991.  Applicant began a\nrelationship with another woman in 1994, and they married in 1997.  Applicant undertook court\naction to dissolve that marriage in 1998, although their financial relationship continued until 2002.\nMany of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose during that period.  Applicant has now been married\nto his third wife for almost five years.  Applicant is responsible for 14 unresolved delinquent debts.\nAmong those, the SOR identifies eight worthless checks, for which judgments of restitution were\nordered.  Some of the other debts were reduced to judgments as well.  After the hearing, the record\nwas held open for Applicant to submit proof of payment of many of the debts, but Applicant did not\nsubmit documentation on most of the debts.  Applicant is behind on his mortgage payments and\nfailed to provide corroboration of a new mortgage payment plan.  Applicant\u2019s net monthly income\nremainder after expenses and debt payments is $34.  Applicant was served with final judgments in\nconnection with his eviction from four apartments for failure to pay rent.  Applicant failed to give\ncorrect answers to three questions on his security clearance application involving arrests, civil court\nactions, and unpaid judgments.  As a result, the Judge concluded that Applicant deliberately falsified\nmaterial facts.          \n      \nApplicant argues that the Judge committed error when she failed to apply pertinent\nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and Guideline E.  In effect, Applicant is arguing that the\nJudge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.  There\nis a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, unless the Judge\nspecifically states otherwise; and there is no requirement that the Judge mention or discuss every\npiece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3 (App.\nBd. May 16, 2005).   Applicant admitted many of the SOR allegations against him with\nexplanations.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns\nraised by those allegations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge discussed the mitigating conditions that\nmight apply in Applicant\u2019s case and explained why she did not apply them.  Moreover, the\napplication of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or\n\n3\nmore of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier\nof fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence\noutweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nNov. 13, 2008).  \n \nIn support of his appeal, Applicant points to three decisions by the Hearing Office, which\nhe argues support his request for a favorable determination.  The Board gives due consideration to\nthese cases.  However, each case must be decided upon its own merits.  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6\n2(b).  Moreover, Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor\non the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  In this case, we also note\nthat  one of the cited decisions was overturned by the Board on appeal.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 20, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn September 4, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March \n4, 2010. Applicant and Department Counsel agreed that his hearing would be held April \n28, 2010. On April 27, 2010, Applicant requested a continuance so that he could be \nrepresented by counsel. I granted Applicant\u2019s request, and with the consent of the \nparties, rescheduled Applicant\u2019s hearing for May 4, 2010. The hearing was held, as \nrescheduled, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government called no \nwitnesses and introduced 38 exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 38 and \nadmitted to the record without objection. The Government also offered an explanatory \nchart, identified as an allegation matrix, which showed where information relating to \nspecific allegations could be found in the Government\u2019s exhibits. I marked this \ndocument as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant did not object to my review of HE 1. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and called one witness. He offered four exhibits, \nwhich were marked as Ex. A through D and admitted without objection. At the \nconclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for two weeks, at Applicant\u2019s request, so \nthat he could provide additional information for the record. Applicant timely submitted six \nadditional exhibits, which were marked as Ex. E through Ex. J and admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on May 12, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 12 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.l.); 15 allegations under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.o.); and seven allegations of disqualifying \nconduct under AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. through 3.g.). In his Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted all Guideline J, Guideline F, and Guideline E allegations and \nprovided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. \n(Answer to SOR; Tr. 21, 35; Ex. D.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and employed as an aircraft mechanic by a federal \ncontractor. He was awarded a security clearance for the first time in 1978, when he was \nserving in the military. He held the clearance during his 20 years of military service. \nAfter his retirement from the military and honorable discharge in 1998, he was \nemployed in several jobs that did not require a security clearance. He was also \nunemployed from June to October 2001, from October 2002 until August 2003, and \nfrom January to March 2004. However, from March 2000 until October 2002 he was \nemployed by the federal government as an aircraft mechanic in a position that required \na clearance. He has worked for his present employer in a position requiring a security \nclearance since April 2004. He now seeks renewal of his eligibility for access to \nclassified information.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 55-58.) \n \n \nApplicant married in 1985. He and his wife divorced in 1991. In 1994, Applicant \nbegan a relationship with another woman. During this relationship, from 1994 to 1998, \nApplicant was deployed for approximately six months of every year. He gave his \ngirlfriend power of attorney so that she could handle his financial responsibilities while \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nhe was deployed. He and his girlfriend also were joint owners of a checking account. \n(Ex. 1; Tr. 60-62, 106-108.)  \n \n \nIn October 1996, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend gave birth to their daughter. Applicant and \nhis girlfriend were married in 1997. At some time during her marital relationship with \nApplicant, his wife became involved with another man. Applicant and his wife became \nestranged and separated, although their financial relationship continued until about \n2002.  Applicant\u2019s wife was physically abusive to him and they were unable to share \ncustody of their child without animosity and physical confrontations. Applicant \ndetermined that his wife had not divorced her former husband before marrying him, and \nin 1998 he undertook court action to dissolve his marriage as bigamous. The custody \nissue was not resolved, and in 2003, at Applicant\u2019s request, a domestic relations court \nterminated his parental rights as in the best interest of his daughter. (Ex. 3; Tr. 65-66, \n108-111.) \n \n \nAfter he and his wife separated, Applicant became involved with another woman. \nApplicant and the woman lived together, and the relationship lasted for about two years. \n(Tr. 66-69.) \n \n \n   Applicant is now married to his third wife. Applicant\u2019s wife testified as a witness \non his behalf, and she stated that she and Applicant have been married \u201calmost five \nyears.\u201d1 (Tr. 58-59, 129.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that for a five-year period between \n1996 and 2001, he presented worthless checks to obtain property. The SOR alleged at \n\u00b6 1.a. that in April 1996, Applicant engaged in the criminal act of Worthless Check-\nObtain Property (WC-OBT Prop), and the charge was nolle prossed in November 1996.  \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.c. that Applicant engaged in three counts of WC-OBT Prop in \nFebruary 1997, and the charge was nolle prossed in November 1997. The SOR alleged \nat \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant was arrested in October 1997 and charged with WC-OBT Prop, \nin violation of state law. (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. 2; Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Ex. 6; Ex. 17.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.d. that Applicant was arrested in September 1998 and \ncharged with obtaining property with a worthless check. The SOR also alleges at \u00b6 1.e. \nthat in April 1998, Applicant committed three counts of WC-OBT Prop, and in December \n1998, the court ordered him to pay $160. (SOR; Ex. 2; Ex. 7; Ex. 8; Ex.17.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.f. that Applicant engaged in seven criminal acts of WC-\nOBT - - five in March, April, and May of 1998 and two in March 2000 - - and in October \n \n1 When he executed and signed his SF-86 on June 19, 2006, Applicant listed his first wife only. He did \nnot list his second and third wives, even though the testimonial evidence suggests he was married to his \nthird wife when he executed his SF-86.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2001, he pled nolo contendere to all charges and was sentenced to pay court costs, \nwhich were waived. (SOR; Ex. 9; Ex. 15.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.i. that Applicant was charged with obtaining \nproperty for worthless check on February 26, 2000, and, on the next day, February 27, \n2000, he was cited with an additional worthless check charge. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 \n1.k. that on April 19, 2001, Applicant was charged with nine counts of obtaining property \nfor worthless check. (SOR; Ex. 2; Ex. 17; Ex. 18; Ex. 20.) \n \n \nApplicant denied ever intentionally writing a worthless check.  He opined that his \nsecond wife wrote many of the checks on their joint account without his knowledge \nwhen they were disputing the custody of their daughter or when he was deployed. He \nprovided a document from the county court in the jurisdiction in which many of the \nworthless checks were written. The document recited that on October 31, 2001, \nApplicant had been placed on probation for four months and ordered to make restitution \nfor some of the worthless checks. The document further recited that Applicant\u2019s \nprobation had been terminated in February 2002 upon satisfactory compliance with the \nterms of the probation. (Ex. D; Tr. 62-64.) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he had not satisfied all of the worthless check \ncharges during his four-month probationary period. He stated that he satisfied some of \nthe charges individually at other times. He did not provide documentation to establish \nthe resolution of specific worthless check charges. (Tr. 62-64, 103.)  \n \n \nIn February 2000, after separating from his second wife, Applicant was involved \nwith a woman. She complained to police that Applicant was bothering her. Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with Trespassing after Warning and Resisting and Opposing \na Police Officer. He was found guilty of Trespassing After Warning and sentenced to \ntwo days of incarceration, with credit for two days served. The charge of resisting and \nopposing a police officer was nolle prossed. This conduct is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. \n(SOR; Ex. 16; Ex. 17; Tr. 66-68.) \n \n \nApplicant denied any violence in the relationship with the girlfriend. He claimed \nthat that the girlfriend initiated contact with him. He told the girlfriend that he did not \nwant any more contact with her, and she reported to the police that he had contact with \nher. In March 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with Trespass Occupy. He \npled nolo contendere, was found guilty, and was sentenced to two days imprisonment. \nThe court issued a restraining order forbidding Applicant to contact the girlfriend.  \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j. (SOR; Ex. 19; Tr. 68-69.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.l. that in October 2001, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with Violation of Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence. He was \nplaced on probation, required to complete a first step program, and to have no contact \nwith the girlfriend. Applicant took part in a domestic violence program, although he \ndenied any violence in the relationship with the girlfriend. On August 13, 2002, Applicant \ncompleted the first step program, and January 9, 2003, his probation was terminated. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nHe has not been charged with domestic violence since 2001. Applicant\u2019s wife, who \ntestified as a witness on his behalf, stated that during their five-year marriage, there had \nbeen no incidents of domestic violence. (SOR; Ex. 2; Ex. 17; Ex. 21 to Ex. 23; Ex. A; \nEx. B; Tr. 69-72, 111-113, 130.) \n \n                                                Financial Considerations  \n \n \nApplicant is responsible for 14 unresolved delinquent debts. The SOR alleged at \n\u00b6 2.a. that a creditor obtained a judgment against him for a $958 debt to a computer \ncompany, and, as of April 7, 2009, the debt had not been paid. Applicant claimed he \nhad satisfied the judgment in 2006. The judgment was listed on Applicant\u2019s credit report \nof April 9, 2009. At his hearing Applicant stated he intended to provide proof of payment \nin a post-hearing submission. However, he failed to do so. (SOR; Ex. 25; Tr. 75-76.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.b. that Applicant owed a communications company $311 \non an account shown as past due on his April 7, 2009 credit report. The SOR alleged at \n\u00b6 2.c. that he owed a telecommunications company a delinquent debt of $161. Applicant \nstated that he had satisfied the $311 debt in 2007 or 2008, and he stated that he had \nsatisfied the $161 debt at an unspecified time. He failed to provide documentation to \nestablish that either debt had been satisfied. (SOR; Ex. 25; Tr. 76-77.)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.d. that Applicant owed a creditor $636 on a delinquent \ndebt in collection status. The debt was listed on Applicant\u2019s credit report of April 7, 2009. \nApplicant admitted the debt but did not know if it had been paid or otherwise satisfied. \nHe stated he would try to provide documentation to establish the status of the debt, but \nhe failed to provide documentation. (SOR; Ex. 25; Tr. 77-78.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.e. that as of April 7, 2009, Applicant was making partial \npayments on his home mortgage. Applicant stated that he was late in paying his \nmortgage and unable to make full monthly payments because he had to allocate money \nto unexpected and expensive car repairs. He claimed he was renegotiating the amount \nof his home mortgage payments with the creditor and would provide documentation to \ncorroborate the new mortgage payment plan. However, he failed to do so. (SOR; Ex. \n25; Tr. 79-80.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.f. that in 2002, a creditor had obtained a judgment \nagainst Applicant on a $2,575 debt, and the judgment remained unsatisfied. Applicant \nclaimed that the judgment was being satisfied through a $50 allotment deducted each \nmonth from his military retirement pay. He also claimed that he had made payments \ntotaling over $1,600 on the debt. As a post-hearing submission, he provided a copy of \nhis retirement pay monthly summary for January 4, 2010. The summary showed that \ntwo allotments of $50 were deducted from Applicant\u2019s monthly retirement pay. However, \nneither allotment identified the creditor listed at SOR \u00b6 2.f. (SOR; Ex. 26; Ex. J; Tr. 80-\n81.) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \n \nThe SOR identified eight judgments of restitution ordered against Applicant in \n2001 for property he acquired by writing worthless checks. The judgments of restitution \nand the amount Applicant was ordered to pay on each of them are as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.g. ($50); 2.h. ($14); 2.i. ($38.59); 2.j. ($75); 2.k. ($75); 2.l. ($47.60); 2.m. ($225); 2.n. \n($303.35.). Applicant did not know if the judgments of restitution had been satisfied. He \nstated that in 2001 he was going through financial and domestic stress. He stated he \nwould try to obtain and provide documentation establishing that the judgments of \nrestitution had been satisfied. However, he failed to do so. (SOR; Ex. 27; Ex. 28; Ex. 29; \nEx.30; Ex. 31; Ex. 32; Ex. 33; Ex. 34; Tr. 81-83.) \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleged under the financial consideration adjudicative guideline \nthe financial criminal conduct alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.; \u00b6 1.h.; \u00b6 1.i.; and \u00b6 1.k. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.o.) \n \n \nApplicant discussed his monthly budget at his hearing, and, as a post-hearing \nsubmission, he provided a current budget. His budget documents that his net monthly \nsalary is $3,135 and his wife\u2019s net monthly salary is $1,600. Applicant also receives \n$1,202 in military retirement pay. However, after taxes, deductions, and allotments2 are \nsubtracted, Applicant\u2019s net monthly retirement pay is approximately $518. His net \nmonthly income, then, is approximately $5,253.  (Ex. E; Ex. J; Tr. 84-85.) \n \n \nApplicant listed the following monthly expenses: mortgage: $2,900; groceries: \n$450; clothing: $150; utilities: $380; car expenses: $520; medical expenses: $35; \nmiscellaneous: $389.  His monthly household expenses total $4,824. (Ex. E.) \n \n \nApplicant reported that he and his wife pay $395 each month on six current \ndebts, five of which are credit card debts. The sixth debt identified on his payment list is \nthe debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.f.  Applicant\u2019s budget shows that he pays $50 a month on \nthat debt. Applicant shows a net monthly remainder after expenses and debt payment of \n$34.  (Ex. E.)  \n \n \nApplicant listed real estate assets valued at $220,000 and 401(k) plan balances \nfor himself and his wife of approximately $28,000. He has $188 in his personal savings \naccount. He supports his mother with an allotment of $135 from his paycheck every two \nweeks.  (Ex. E; Ex. G; Ex. I; Tr. 100-101, 121-122.) \n \n \nBefore he purchased his home in 2006, Applicant consulted a debt management \nfirm. The firm provided him with a plan for resolving his debts. Applicant did not hire the \nfirm to act on his behalf to resolve his debts because he concluded that the firm\u2019s fee \nwas too high. However, he followed the debt management program and paid off some \nof his debts. (Tr. 101-102.) \n \n \n2 From his military retirement pay, Applicant authorized the following allotments: a $35 health insurance \npremium, two discretionary payments of $50 to creditors not identified in the SOR, and a loan payment of \n$288 to a creditor not identified in the SOR. (Ex. J.) \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                 Personal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant was served with final judgments deriving from his eviction from four \napartments for failure to pay rent. In September 1998, a final judgment was entered, \ngiving a landlord the right to recover an apartment leased to Applicant. Applicant stated \nthat this apartment had been occupied by his second wife, who shared occupancy of \nthe apartment with her lover while he was on deployment. Applicant did not know about \nthe lover, and he had provided his former wife with money to pay the rent, but she had \nnot used the money for that purpose. When he returned from deployment, he learned \nthat she no longer resided in the apartment and had not paid the rent for several \nmonths. The landlord took action to evict Applicant. The final judgment is alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 3.d. (SOR; Ex. 38; Tr. 85-86.) \n \n \nA year later, in November 1999, Applicant was again served with a final judgment \nof eviction entered against him for failure to honor his lease agreement. Applicant stated \nthat he was filing for divorce from his second wife when he rented the apartment. He \nwas paying legal fees, experiencing financial difficulties, and lacked sufficient funds to \npay the rent. The final judgment is alleged at SOR \u00b6 3.c. (SOR; Ex. 37; Tr. 88.) \n \n \nIn August 2000 and February 2001, another landlord twice obtained final \njudgments to evict Applicant from an apartment for failure to pay his rent and honor his \nlease agreement. These evictions also occurred when Applicant was experiencing \nfinancial difficulties. The final judgments authorizing the evictions are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n3.a. and 3.b. (SOR; Ex. 35; Ex. 36; Tr. 88-89.) \n \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant executed an SF-86.  Section 23f on the SF-86 reads: \n \nIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted \nof any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave \nout traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug-\nrelated.) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23f. He did not disclose his 2000 and 2001 arrests, \ncharges, citations, and convictions, which were alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., \n1.k., and 1.l.  Applicant stated that he did not deliberately fail to list his 2000 and 2001 \noffenses. He stated that he thought the offenses had occurred more than seven years \nbefore 2006, and he therefore was not required to report them. (SOR; Ex. 1; Tr. 93-94.)     \n \n \nSection 27d on the SF-86 reads: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any \njudgments against you that have not been paid?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section \n27d and did not disclose the judgments listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.f., 2.g., 2.h., 2.i., 2.j., \n2.k., 2.l., 2.m., and 2.n. When asked to explain his state of mind when he answered as \nhe did, Applicant stated: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI did not know I had the judgments even in - - I didn\u2019t - - I did not know I \nhad the judgments at that time. I just - - I thought that was part of what \nhappened. I thought I - - I just didn\u2019t know I had those on me. It was so \nlong ago. That\u2019s why I answered no. \n \n(Ex. 1; Tr. 94-95.) \n \n \nSection 29 on the SF-86 reads: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been a party to any \npublic record civil court actions not listed elsewhere on this form?\u201d Applicant answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to Section 29.  He failed to disclose the civil judgments alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.f. \nthrough 2.n., and 3.a. through 3.d. Applicant stated that he did not disclose the civil \njudgments because \u201cI did not know that it was there.\u201d (Ex. 1; Tr. 95.)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he had completed several security clearance \napplications in the 20 years that he had held a security clearance. He denied ever \nintentionally falsifying any information on a security clearance application. (Tr. 95-96.) \n  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n \n \nApplicant admits writing worthless checks to obtain property from 1996 to 2001. \nWhile he stated that some of the worthless checks were written by his second wife \nduring his deployments, many were written after he retired from military service in 1998. \nIn his answer to the SOR, he admitted all allegations of writing worthless checks. He \nprovided documentation establishing that, in 2002, he was released from four months of \nprobation to which he had been sentenced for obtaining property in exchange for \nworthless checks. He was released from probation because he had made restitution for \nsome of the worthless checks. Applicant was unable to specify the specific checks or \namounts that he had repaid in restitution.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nIn 2000, Applicant was arrested, found guilty of trespassing, and enjoined from \ncontact with a woman who had complained of receiving unwanted attention from him. \nHe was incarcerated for two days. In 2001, after contact with the woman again, he was \narrested and charged with Violation of Injunction for Protection Against Domestic \nViolence. He was placed on probation, required to complete a first step program, and \nordered to have no further contact with the woman. Applicant complied with the terms of \nhis probation.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal history raises concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) and AG \u00b6 31(c). \nAG \u00b6 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \n\u201callegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior between 1996 and \n2001 was consequential. Even though some of the worthless checks were written by \nApplicant\u2019s second wife, Applicant acknowledged that he also wrote worthless checks \nduring a time of domestic turmoil. Additionally, he demonstrated poor judgment by \nviolating a protective order requested by a former girlfriend. \n \n \n \n In 2002, Applicant completed court-ordered probation and provided restitution \nfor some of the worthless checks he wrote. Additionally, in 2003, he also completed a \ncourt-ordered rehabilitative program that focused on preventing domestic violence. He \nhas not been arrested or charged with any criminal behavior since his release from \nthese two probations. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior occurred between 1986 and 2001, approximately \nnine to 14 years ago. During these years, Applicant was in volatile and stressful \ndomestic relationships. His actions during those years demonstrated that he was \nunreliable, untrustworthy, and exercised poor judgment. Applicant participated in and \ncompleted two court-ordered probations. He made restitution for some of the worthless \nchecks he wrote. He has not been involved in criminal conduct since 2001. I conclude \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply in mitigation to the criminal conduct alleged in this \ncase.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Additionally, AG \u00b6 19(d) raises the following security concern: \n\u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check \nfraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and \nother intentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d Although Applicant did not owe large \namounts of consumer debt, he allowed old debt to accumulate and remain unsatisfied. \nHe failed to provide documentation establishing that he had paid or settled his \ndelinquent debts. His monthly financial shortfall prevented him from making full payment \non his monthly mortgage obligation. Between 1996 and 2001, he wrote worthless \nchecks, and he failed to provide documentation showing that he had satisfied eight \njudgments in restitution that were levied against him in 2001. This evidence is sufficient \nto raise the disqualifying conditions identified at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(d). \n \nGuideline F also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d))  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency that dates to at least 1996. From \n1996 to 2001, he was involved in two stressful domestic relationships. He provided \n\n \n12 \n \n \nmoney and legal authority to his second wife to pay his debts when he was deployed in \nmilitary service. She, however, was not trustworthy, failed to pay his debts, and wrote \nworthless checks. Applicant also wrote worthless checks. He served a court-directed \nprobation and satisfied by restitution some debts he incurred by writing fraudulent  \nchecks. However, he failed to provide documentation establishing that he had satisfied \nfour outstanding debts and eight judgments of restitution alleged in the SOR. He also \nfailed to provide documentation about the status of his mortgage, which fell into arrears \nwhen he paid other debts in lieu of his mortgage. \n \nApplicant testified that he had been paying the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.f. He \nprovided some corroboration for his testimony that he had a payment plan in place with \nthe creditor and had authorized a monthly allotment of $50 from his military retirement \npay to satisfy the debt. Accordingly, the allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.f. is concluded for \nApplicant.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s domestic relationships between 1996 and 2001 were stressful and \ndifficult. However, he did not respond reasonably to these circumstances when he wrote \nworthless checks and failed to satisfy his just debts. Although he now appears to be in a \nstable domestic situation, he was unable to provide documentation establishing that he \nhad paid or satisfied most of his long-standing financial delinquencies. Moreover, his \nmonthly budget suggests that he may be financially overextended. He has less than \n$200 in his savings account and his net monthly remainder is about $34. He did not \nappear to be attentive to his financial obligations or to have a clear plan for resolving \nthem. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply in mitigation to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to the facts of this case. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nFrom 1998 to 2001, Applicant failed to pay his rent, thereby causing his landlords \nto sue to evict him. Judgments were entered for the landlords four times, and Applicant \nwas evicted. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and certified his SF-86 in 2006, he failed to report, in \nresponse to Section 23, that he had been arrested for, or charged with, or convicted of \ncriminal conduct as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.l. He also failed to \nreport, in response to Section 27, the unsatisfied judgments against him as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., and 2.f. through 2.n.  Additionally, in response to Section 29 on the SF-86, \n\n \n13 \n \n \nApplicant failed to disclose that he had been a party to public civil record court actions \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.f. through 2.n. and 3.a. through 3.d. \n \n \nApplicant denied that his falsifications in his responses to Sections 23, 27 and 29 \nwere deliberate. He said that he failed to report his criminal conduct in 2000 and 2001 \nbecause he thought the individual criminal acts had occurred more than seven years \nbefore he completed and certified his SF-86 in June 2006 and he was, therefore, not \nrequired to report them. He explained that he failed to report that he was party to public \nrecord civil cases because \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was there.\u201d He explained his failure to \nreport any judgments levied against him as follows: \u201cI did not know I had the judgments \neven in - - I didn\u2019t - - I did not know I had the judgments at that time. I just - - I thought \nthat was part of what happened. I thought I - - I just didn\u2019t know I had those on me. It \nwas so long ago. That\u2019s why I answered no.\u201d \n \nThe Guideline E allegations in the SOR raise a security concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a) and 16(d)(3). AG \u00b6 16(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification \nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) reads: \n \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes, but is not limited \nto consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a) if \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d If \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, \nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security process\u201d and \u201c[u]pon being made aware of \nthe requirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated fully and \ncompletely,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \n\n \n14 \n \n \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) might apply if \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay his rent at various times between 1998 and 2001 \nresulted in final judgments granting his landlords\u2019 requests to evict him. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to pay his rent is not recent, but it is a serious matter. Applicant is now a \nhomeowner who has failed to pay, in full, his monthly mortgage payments. It is not clear \nat this time that Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his housing obligations occurred under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply to the facts of this case.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing \nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under \nGuideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to \npresent evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)).  \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has, in the course of his employment in the \nmilitary and as a government contractor, completed an SF-86 several times. He denied \nthat he deliberately falsified his answers to Sections 23, 27, and 29. However, he failed \nto give coherent credible reasons for providing \u201cNo\u201d answers to the questions in the \nthree sections. \n \n \nApplicant falsified material facts on the SF-86 that he executed and certified as \ntrue in June 2006. Nothing in the record suggests that he took prompt good faith action \nto correct the omissions, concealments or falsifications before he was confronted with \nthe facts. (AG \u00b6 17(a).) Nothing in the record suggests that his failure to report his \ncriminal behavior was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice specifically about the security clearance process from authorized individuals or \nlegal counsel. (AG \u00b6 17(b).) When he executed his security clearance application, \nApplicant knew he had a record of criminal behavior. As a mature adult, he knew that \nhis criminal behavior was not minor, so remote in time, so infrequent, or had occurred \nunder such unique circumstances that it would not seriously impact his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. (AG 17(c).) Applicant failed to provide documentation that he \n\n \n15 \n \n \nobtained counseling or had taken other positive steps that might alleviate the \ncircumstances that caused his unreliable conduct and, as a result, such behavior was \nunlikely to recur. (AG \u00b6 17(d).) Nothing in the record suggests that Applicant took \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress that his behavior caused. (AG \u00b6 17(e).) I conclude, therefore, that none of the \napplicable personal conduct mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \n \nI observed Applicant carefully at his hearing, and I listened to his explanations of \nhis state of mind at the time the falsifications occurred. I conclude that he failed to carry \nhis burden of persuasion to rebut the Government\u2019s prima facie case under Guideline E. \nI conclude that his falsifications to his answers to Sections 23, 27, and 29 were \ndeliberate. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his or her \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. After \ntwo volatile domestic relationships, he now appears to be in a mature and stable \nmarriage. This suggests some successful rehabilitation. \n \nHowever, the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved. Applicant \nhas had difficulty meeting his monthly mortgage payments, and his net monthly \nremainder appears to be $34. When he completed his SF-86 in June 2006, Applicant \ndeliberately falsified material facts when he answered sections 23, 27, and 29. His \nfailure to honestly report his past criminal behavior and his financial record create a \nsituation that could seriously mislead the government about his honesty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. His falsifications were not minor: they went to the heart of his capacity \n\n \n16 \n \n \nfor truthfulness, a critical qualification for one who would hold a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to be truthful was deliberate. He made no effort to correct his \nfalsifications before the government confronted him with his lack of candor. His \ndeliberate falsifications are recent. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude that while Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was mitigated by the \npassage of time, he failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \ndelinquencies and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.l.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. - 2.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.g. \u2013 2.o.:  \nAgainst Applicant   \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:             \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. - 3.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                           Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 50-year-old single man who has been employed as an engineer by a defense contractor since October 1990. From August 1985 until October 1990, he was employed as an engineer by a different defense contractor. Applicant graduated from high school in 1975.

Applicant used and purchased marijuana while in high school. On one occasion he purchased a quarter pound of marijuana, divided it into four smaller packages, and sold them for profit. He denies using marijuana or associating with anyone who used marijuana from his high school years until approximately 1999.

He was questioned about his use of\nmarijuana when he first applied for a security clearance in 1985 and assured the\ninvestigator who questioned him that he would never use marijuana in the future.\nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions in May 2006 (GE 1) in\nwhich he disclosed he had used marijuana between seven and fourteen times from\nJanuary 1999 to May 2006. He blamed his use of marijuana during this time period on\nassociating with one or more cousins who used marijuana and with whom he wanted to be\nfriendly. He last used marijuana on December 31, 2006, and asserts he will not use it again\nin the future because he does not want to jeopardize his security clearance. (GE 4)\nHowever, he told a DoD investigator on May 29, 2007, that he could not definitely rule out\nfuture use if he visited with the cousin who he had been smoking marijuana with, and he\nfurther qualified that assertion at the hearing as follows:\nNow, how do I know what is going to happen in the future. I won\u2019t do it. I tell\nyou if you are a good Hollywood screenwriter you could dream up some\nstation [sic], you know, where it winds up happening. (Tr. 48)\nApplicant submitted a random urinalysis sample on May 21, 2008, that was negative for\nthe presence of any controlled substance, including marijuana.

Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline H (drug involvement),\nwith its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\nApplicant purchased and used marijuana while in high school. On one occasion\nwhile in high school he purchased, divided and resold a quarter pound of marijuana. He\nabstained from marijuana use for almost 25 years before starting to smoke it with a cousin\nwith whom he wanted to become more friendly. He used marijuana approximately seven\nto fourteen times between January 1999 and December 31, 2006, including after he\nsubmitted his security clearance application in 2006. He possessed a security clearance\nat all times while using marijuana after 1999. \nWhile Applicant asserts he will not use marijuana in the future, he found it necessary\nto qualify that assertion by pointing out that he could not definitely rule out future use if he\nvisited with his cousin and that it is always conceivable some unforeseen circumstance\ncould occur that would result in him using marijuana. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 25(a):\nany drug abuse; 25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase, sale, or distribution;\n25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and 25(h): . . . or failure\nto clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use all apply.\nI have considered all mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply. While it\nhas been almost 18 months since Applicant last used marijuana, he went almost 25 years\nbetween his high school use and when he resumed smoking marijuana in 1999. Further,\nhis explanation for resuming the use of marijuana and using it intermittently over the course\nof almost eight years amounts to nothing more than his succumbing to mild peer pressure\nand a desire to become more friendly with his cousin. He most recently saw that cousin\nwhen he visited Applicant about six months ago. Add to these facts Applicant\u2019s\nequivocation in his assertion that he will not use marijuana in the future and there cannot\nbe a reliable prediction that he will not use marijuana in the future, including while\npossessing a security clearance. Thus, Mitigating Conditions (MC) 26(a): the behavior\nhappened so long ago . . . or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment does; and 26(b): a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such\nas: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding\nthe environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence;(4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation do not\napply. The remaining mitigating conditions have no application to the facts of this case. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\n\n5\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, to include Applicant\u2019s educational background, the letters of\nrecommendation and work performance appraisals he submitted, his lengthy work history,\nthe number of years he has held a security clearance, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through\n\u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the security concern caused by his drug involvement. He has failed to overcome\nthe case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline H is decided\nagainst Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 24, 2008, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on July 24, 2008. The FORM was mailed to Applicant \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \non July 28, 2008, and it was received on August 26, 2008. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit additional material. The case \nwas assigned to me on October 24, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and has worked for his present employer, a federal \ncontractor, since July 2006. Prior to then from January 2001 until he began his present \nemployment he worked for a different federal contractor. He has held a secret security \nclearance since 2004. He is seeking a Top Secret security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant began using marijuana when he was 13 years old and continued using \nit until January 2007. He resumed using it in July 2007 and used it after he completed \nhis security clearance questionnaire on October 19, 2006. His use continued up to \nNovember 20, 2007, a week before he completed interrogatories questioning him about \nhis drug use. Applicant was using marijuana while he held a secret security clearance.1  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he used cocaine beginning when he was about 14 years old. \nHe listed the frequency of his use as \u201c2-3 lines\u201d at a time on a \u201cmonthly\u201d basis.2 A \nstatement attached to his response to interrogatories said: \u201cI probably only used once or \ntwice over the first three years, until I started working.\u201d He did not further explain his use \nafter he started working, although it appears from his first response that his use \nincreased. He stated he stopped using cocaine in November 2005. He used cocaine \nwhile holding a secret security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant also used hallucinogenic drugs to include LSD and mushrooms. He \nestimated he used these substances about 15 times over a four to five year period. He \nstopped using them around his 21st birthday. He stated: \u201cWhat I originally thought was a \n\u2018good time\u2019 turned into downright frightening situations, and I did indeed stop using.\u201d3 \n \n \nApplicant stated he is attempting to get a Top Secret security clearance. He \nbelieves himself to be a hard worker and is proud to be a part of the community where \nhe works and is surrounded by very positive role models that are aware of his past \nexperiences with drug use. He vows to stop all marijuana use.4  \n \n1 Item 5. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nOn his security clearance application, Applicant noted in Question 24 that he had \nused marijuana in 1997, during the month of July, on five occasions. He made \nadditional comments that said: \u201cafter high school graduation, not used since.\u201d These \nstatements were not alleged as falsifications and they will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes, but will be considered when evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n25 and have especially considered (a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d); (c) (\u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or \npossession of drug paraphernalia\u201d) and (g) (\u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a \nsecurity clearance\u201d). Applicant admitted all of the drug use allegations and that he used \nillegal drugs while holding a security clearance. To use drugs one must possess them. \nTherefore, I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nand especially considered (a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, \nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), and (b) (\u201ca \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\u201d). Applicant stated he \ndoes not intend to use marijuana in the future. He abstained from using illegal drugs for \none six-month period in the last 16 years, but then lapsed back into using marijuana. \nHis statement that he intended to stop using marijuana was made a week after his last \nuse when he was answering questions to interrogatories for his security clearance. \nApplicant has a long history of using various illegal drugs. He is past the age of youthful \nindiscretion. He regularly used marijuana and cocaine while holding a secret security \nclearance, even while his background investigation was on-going. His use was frequent \nand recent. He did not offer sufficient evidence to show he has changed his ways. He \nhas not met his burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by his drug use. His \n\n \n5 \n \n \nactions cast serious doubt on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Therefore, I \nfind that no mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nI have considered the personal conduct security concerns. I find, based on the \nfacts, AG \u00b6 16 (e) (\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group\u201d) applies. Almost every aspect of a person\u2019s life can be evaluated \ngenerally as a security concern under Personal Conduct. I have considered all of the \nfacts in this case from that Personal Conduct perspective. I find Applicant\u2019s conduct \nfrom a whole person analysis raises questions as to his judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness, which could be exploited. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 30 years old and has a \nlong history of illegal drug use. After obtaining a secret security clearance he continued \nto use illegal drugs. Although he stated he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture he only recently made a commitment to abstinence. Overall the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from drug involvement and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Daniel Lynch, Attorney At Law\nFebruary 19, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on June 28, 2006\nand April 17, 2008.  On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 2, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on October 6, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 17,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for November 5, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented three exhibits referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3.  The Applicant\npresented seven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G.  He also\n\n2\ntestified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on\nNovember 24, 2008, to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  He\nsubmitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit consisting of nine pages, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit A, that was admitted without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.)\nwas received on December 8, 2008\n.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 42 years old and has a Ph.D. in Electric Engineering.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Electrical Engineer, and is applying for a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior). The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his sexual behavior\ninvolved a criminal offense, is indicative of a personality or emotional disorder, reflects\nlack of judgment or discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence or\ncoercion, or reflects a lack of judgment or discretion.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations that raise questions abut his ability to protect classified\ninformation.   \nParagraph 3 (Guideline M - Use of Information Technology Systems.  The Government\nalleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nbeen noncompliant with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to\ninformation technology systems that may raise security concerns about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to properly\nprotect sensitive systems, networks, and information.  Information Technology Systems\ninclude all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the\ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.  \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under the\nguidelines set forth above.  The Applicant has worked in the defense industry for over\neighteen years.  He held a secret level security clearance and SCI access during some\nof that period with his previous employer.\n        \nDuring the Applicant\u2019s Special background investigation required during his\napplication for SCI access, he underwent a polygraph examination that took three\n\n3\nseparate sessions to complete, February - March 2005.  In May 2005, he was ultimately\ndenied SCI access.  While working for his previous employer, he admitted to accessing,\nviewing and downloading pornographic material on his company computer from about\n1998 or 1999, to at least 2005 during work hours.  (Tr. P. 48).  The Applicant explained\nthat on some occasions he simply viewed the pornographic materials in his office or in\nhis outside private cubicle.  (Tr. p. 91).  He would surf the internet and look at\npornography.  (Tr. p. 82).  On at least five or six separate occasions, he would\ndownload pornographic video clips on the company computer.  On other occasions,\nwhen he was in his office and viewing pornographic material, he would shut his door\nand masturbate.  The Applicant explained that he never downloaded \u201ckiddy porn\u201d.  He\nonly downloaded \u201cDominatrix\u201d or \u201cMistresses\u201d or \u201cS&M\u201d and he enjoyed the images.\n(Tr. pp. 89-90).  Although he shared the office with another person, he only masturbated\nwhen he knew the other person was not around.  (Tr. p. 51).  The Applicant testified that\nhe was aware that it was against company rules and regulations to use the company\ncomputer to view pornography.  (Tr. p. 59).  He adds however, that the company\ncomputer was unclassified.  (Tr. p. 83).  Also, he did not realize the seriousness of\naccessing these pornographic sites.  He engaged in this conduct mainly at night,\nhowever there were times he did it in the day.  He would listen for someone moving to\nmake sure no one was around before engaging in such conduct.              \nIn 1998, during weekends and/or after work hours, when the Applicant knew that\nthey weren\u2019t around, the Applicant would telephone female employees to hear their\nvoices on the answering machine.  He would then hang up without leaving a message.\nOn average, he called three separate women about twenty to thirty times each.  (Tr. P.\n98).  One of the women was so annoyed by the hang-ups that she had the call traced\nand found out that it was the Applicant.  She admonished him for the conduct and he\nnever did it again.  He states that he learned his lesson from this situation.\nAgain in 1998, during the weekend, the Applicant entered the offices of female\noffice workers, who worked in other buildings, when they were not present and look at\ntheir personal belongings.  The Applicant explained that he did not go into their drawers\nor anything like that.  He had wanted to meet these women and wanted to see if there\nwas a picture of them on their desk.  He simply looked at what was sitting on their desk.\n(Tr. p. 60 - 61). \nIn 1996 or 1997 and in 2004, the Applicant accidentally collided into other cars\nwith his car while in parking lots and failed to notify the owners of the vehicles.  The\nApplicant testified that in 1996, while in the company parking lot, he accidentally hit a\nfellow coworkers car.   He noticed the damage, but did not report it.  He panicked and\nfelt bad about the situation, but that was all.  In 2004, he was in a supermarket parking\nlot when he again hit another car on accident.  He thought the damage if any was\nminimal and did not notify the owner of the vehicle.  At the time, the Applicant was upset\nthat the owner of the vehicle had boxed him in and thought that it was probably the\nother person\u2019s fault.  (Tr. p. 86-87).   \n\n4\nIn June 2008, the Applicant received a lay-off notice from his employer that\nbecame effective on August 21, 2008.  Applicant was hired by another defense\ncontractor on October 13, 2008.  No one at his present company knows anything about\nhis previous misconduct and he does not want them to, as it is embarrassing. \nApplicant testified that he was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\n(OCD) in August or September 1997.  He initially started seeing a psychologist who\nreferred him to a psychiatrist that he has been seeing once every three to four months\nsince October 1998.  Applicant is currently on various medications for his condition and\nbelieves that he has a chemical imbalance in his brain.  His admits that his perception of\nreality was at times kind of disturbing.  His medical records describe this as having\nunwanted thoughts that cause him to become anxious.  His psychiatrist has not been\ntreating him specifically for any of the conduct that is set forth in the SOR.  The\nApplicant and his psychiatrist believe that his condition is fairly under control, as long as\nhe is on medication.  (Tr. p. 116 and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).  Applicant\nexplained that at his new company, the parking lot is quite large and he parks in the\nback to avoid any problems.  Also, the women are older and not attractive.     \nNine letters of recommendation from professional colleagues, previous\ncoworkers, neighbors and friends of the Applicant attest to his hardworking, self-driven\nand reliable nature.  He is considered conscientious and honest and very\nknowledgeable in his field.  He was known to stay late or work on weekends to\ncomplete the necessary work assignment, and was noted as one of the few engineers\nthat followed the rule to lock his computer when he left the office to keep its monitor out\nof vision of passerbys.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G).  None of the individuals who wrote\nletters on behalf of the Applicant have any knowledge of his misconduct of concern in\nthis case.  (Tr. pp. 149 -150).    \nApplicant received various awards and certificates for outstanding achievement,\ntechnical excellence, and team contribution for his superior work product on a variety of\nprojects during his previous employment.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F).\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n5\nGuideline D -Sexual Behavior\n12. The Concern.  Sexual Behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  No adverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be\nraise solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n13.(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that\nthe person is unable to stop to that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder; \n13.(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress;\n13.(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or\njudgment.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of\nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources;\n16.(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\n\n6\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that\ncountry or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States may service as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other\ngroup.\n  \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology\n39.  The Concern.  Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations\npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability\nto properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.  Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n40.(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology systems or\ncomponent thereof;\n40.(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology system;\n40.(f) introduction, removal or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or\nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, when\nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n7\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) that\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a\nrational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and\nhis ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of\nproof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\n\n8\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's questionable sexual behavior, personal\nconduct and use of information technology has a direct and negative impact on his\nsuitability for access to classified information.  \nThe Applicant has engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior that involved him\naccessing, viewing and downloading pornographic material on his employer\u2019s computer\nfrom 1998 or 1999 to at least 2005.  At times, he masturbated while looking at the\npornography.  This sexual misconduct was offensive and against company rules and\nregulations.  In 1998, he called at least three female employees at least twenty to thirty\ntimes each, to hear their voices on the message before hanging up.  He also entered\ntheir offices to see their pictures on their desks. He believes that he is now in control of\nhis behavior.  However, he does not want anyone to know about his sexual perversions\nof the past and has kept it a secret from his current employer.  Considering this\nevidence in totality, this demonstrates a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior and\nhigh risk conduct that was careless, lacked discretion and good judgment and could\nsubject him to pressure, coercion and/or blackmail, which in turn could subject the\nGovernment to a security risk.\n  \nThe Applicant\u2019s high risk behavior places him in a vulnerable position to be\nsusceptible to pressure, coercion and/or blackmail.  He engaged in these activities as\nrecently as 2005, four years ago.  This demonstrates questionable judgment and lack of\ndiscretion.  The Applicant states that he has been diagnoses with OCD and is on\nmedication that helps to prevent these impulses.  However, presently, the risk is great\nthat he may fall prey to exploitation, coercion or duress.  Under Guideline D,\nDisqualifying Conditions 13(b), \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk\nsexual behavior that the person is unable to stop to that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable\nto coercion, exploitation, or duress;\u201d and 13(d), \u201csexual behavior of a public nature\nand/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment,\u201d apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are even remotely applicable.  The Applicant has not met his burden of\ndemonstrating that his sexual behavior does not raise a security concern, and Guideline\nD is found against the Applicant.\nIn 1996 or 1997 and in 2004, the Applicant damaged vehicles in parking lots and\nfailed to notify the owners.  This behavior is not indicative of trustworthiness and\nreliability.  In fact it is outrageous and unacceptable.  With respect to the Applicant\u2019s\npersonal conduct, Under Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 16.(d) \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\n\n9\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (3)\na pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, (4) evidence of significant misuse of\nGovernment or other employer\u2019s time or resources\u201d and, 16.(e) \u201cpersonal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, - - - may serve\nas a basis for  exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or\nother group\u201d apply.  None of the mitigating factors are applicable.\n \nUnder Guideline M, Disqualifying Conditions 40.(a) \u201cillegal or unauthorized entry\ninto any information technology systems or component thereof,\u201d 40.(e) \u201cunauthorized\nuse of a government or other information technology system\u201d and 40.(f) \u201cintroduction,\nremoval or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any\ninformation technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules,\nprocedures, guidelines or regulations\u201d apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is an intelligent, educated\nprofessional that knew or should have known that his perverted sexual behavior\nviolated at least company policy and was reckless and negligent as best.  Instead, he\nacted in a way that was immature, self-destructive and ignorant of the consequences.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the\nguidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nand/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his sexual misconduct, personal conduct and misuse of\ninformation technology and the impact that it can have on his ability to safeguard\nclassified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to\novercome the Government's case opposing his request for a security  clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3  of the SOR.    \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against the Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: Against the Applicant\nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 3.a.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1. f of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 58 years old. She is married and has two grown children, ages 35 and 40. She enlisted in the U.S. Army in October 1969, and received an honorable discharge in December 1971. For the past ten years, she has worked as an owner- operator truck driver. From June 2002 to one week ago, she drove for a federal contractor, hauling classified freight. She quit the company because she was not receiving enough work to meet her expenses. She will begin driving for another federal contractor within a week. Her husband also owns and operates the truck with her. He has a security clearance. About ten years ago, Applicant\u2019s husband had heart surgery. He was out of work for six months, leading to financial problems for them. After he returned to work, they were unable to obtain sufficient hauling assignment for another six months because of his medical condition. (Tr. 39). During that time, she made minimum payments on her debts because she not could afford to pay them in full. Between 2002 and 2004, some of her debts became delinquent. (Tr. 35-37). She admitted that she did not call the creditors to work out a repayment plan or obtain credit counseling while the debts were accumulating. (Tr. 40). In July 2007, she started resolving her delinquent debts. (Tr. 48). On May 27, 2008",

On \nMay 27, 2008, Applicant submitted a letter and two exhibits that I marked as AE E, F \nand G, and admitted into the record without objection by the Government. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 27, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1. f of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 58 years old. She is married and has two grown children, ages 35 \nand 40.  She enlisted in the U.S. Army in October 1969, and received an honorable \ndischarge in December 1971. For the past ten years, she has worked as an owner-\noperator truck driver. From June 2002 to one week ago, she drove for a federal \ncontractor, hauling classified freight. She quit the company because she was not \nreceiving enough work to meet her expenses. She will begin driving for another federal \ncontractor within a week. Her husband also owns and operates the truck with her. He \nhas a security clearance.   \n \n \nAbout ten years ago, Applicant\u2019s husband had heart surgery. He was out of work \nfor six months, leading to financial problems for them. After he returned to work, they \nwere unable to obtain sufficient hauling assignment for another six months because of \nhis medical condition. (Tr. 39). During that time, she made minimum payments on her \ndebts because she not could afford to pay them in full.  Between 2002 and 2004, some \nof her debts became delinquent. (Tr. 35-37). She admitted that she did not call the \ncreditors to work out a repayment plan or obtain credit counseling while the debts were \naccumulating. (Tr. 40).  In July 2007, she started resolving her delinquent debts. (Tr. \n48).  \n \n \nOn May 27, 2008, Applicant submitted a budget, along with a debt repayment \nplan that she executed on May 23, 2008, for purposes of resolving four unpaid debts. \nThe debt reduction plan will begin in June 2008 and requires a $575 monthly payment. \n(AE G). According to the budget, she and her husband have a net monthly income of \n$21,416. Their monthly expenses, including those related to the cost of operating the \ntruck, total $12,269.  She makes monthly payments of $7,432 on other obligations, such \nas her mortgage, vehicle loans, and credit cards, in addition to the monthly payment for \ndebt management plan. She has a net remainder of about $1,714 per month for other \nexpenses.  She has not incurred any additional delinquent debts since 2004. (Tr. 55-\n56). \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n The SOR alleged Applicant failed to satisfy six delinquent debts, totaling \n$40,470. The status of those debts, as enumerated in the SOR, is as follows: \n \n \n1.a.  Applicant is making monthly payments of $400-425 on an $8,085 debt owed \nto a credit card company for charges she made to operate her truck. The current \nbalance is $5,285. She anticipates paying off the debt sometime in 2009. (AE C and D). \n \n \n1.b. Applicant paid the $7,242 balance owed to a credit card company. (AE A \nand B). \n \n \n1.c. The $6,733 debt owed to a credit card company is unresolved and is \nincluded in the recently executed debt reduction plan. \n \n \n1.d. The $2,153 debt owed to a credit card company is unresolved and is \nincluded in the recently executed debt reduction plan. \n \n \n1.e.  The $6,644 debt owed to an automobile company is for a leased vehicle \nthat Applicant returned. The debt is included in the recently executed debt reduction \nplan. \n \n \n1.f. The $9,617 debt owed to a credit card company is unresolved and is included \nin the recently executed debt reduction plan. \n \n \nSince July 2007, Applicant paid or resolved approximately $15,200 of the \noutstanding delinquent debt. Within the past month, she executed an agreement to \nrepay the remaining $25,200 through a repayment plan that begins in June 2008. She \nintends to resolve all of her debts, stating, \u201cI got myself into it, I have to get out of it.\u201d (Tr. \n58). Based on Applicant\u2019s candid testimony and demeanor, I believe she will make \nthose payments in order to resolve her obligations and maintain her employment.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating delinquent debt after her husband had heart \nsurgery in 1998. He was unable to return to work for six months and then worked at on \na reduced schedule for another six months. She managed to make minimum payments \non many of her outstanding obligations until 2002 at which time they started to become \ndelinquent, some of which remain unresolved until very recently. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n \n(d)  the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue; and \n \n      (f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n Applicant=s delinquent financial obligations accumulated between 2004 and \n2004, and four of them remain current. Because the problems have been ongoing since \narising, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply.  \n \n \n AG \u00b6 20(b) has partial application in this case. Applicant\u2019s debts began \naccumulating as a consequence of her husband\u2019s surgery in 1998 and his inability to \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nreturn to full-time work for about a year later. That was a situation outside of her control. \nHowever, she admitted that she did not take any steps to manage the debts during that \nperiod of time, but instead allowed them to accrue. Thus, full consideration of this \ncondition cannot be applied. \n \nApplicant recently entered into a debt reduction plan with a credit counseling \ncompany to pay the four delinquent debts, totaling $25,200, on a monthly basis. She \nsubmitted a copy of her budget, which indicates that she is able to afford the monthly \npayments on her income, such that her financial obligations are now being resolved and \nunder control. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. \n  \nApplicant presented evidence that she paid or resolved two delinquent debts, \ntotaling about $15,200, over the past year. That evidence demonstrated her good-faith \neffort to manage her financial affairs, sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d).  \n \nThere is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) and AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 58-year-old woman, \nwho served in the U.S. Army for two years in the early 1970\u2019s.  She and her husband \nhave been the owners and operators of a truck for over ten years. For the past five \nyears, they have hauled government freight. Subsequent to her husband\u2019s surgery \nabout ten years ago, she began accumulating delinquent debts that she failed to \nmanage or resolve. However, given her recent resolution of $15,200 of the debt and the \nexecution of an agreement to pay the remaining $25,200, coupled with a budget that \nprovides sufficient income to pay her obligations, I believe similar financial problems will \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nnot recur. The Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 06-12930, \u201cthat an applicant is not \nrequired to show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has \nestablished a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken \u2018significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u2019 ISCR Case No.04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul.6, 2006).\u2019\u201d  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant is a hardworking \nindividual, who readily acknowledged her financial mistakes and committed to resolving \nthem. There is no evidence in her background to indicate that her financial problems \nmay create a security risk. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through f: \n For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant mitigated the security concerns under \nGuideline B, but he did not mitigate the security concerns under Guideline C. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on January 3, 2006. On \nMarch 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines B and C. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 17, 2008; answered it on \nthe same day; and requested an administrative determination without a hearing before \nan administrative judge. DOHA received the request on March 24, 2008. On April 29, \n2008, Department Counsel requested a hearing. The request for a hearing is attached \nto the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nMay 12, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on May 14, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on May 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 17, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through L, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until July 1, 2008, to enable him to \nsubmit additional documentary evidence. Applicant timely submitted AX M, and it was \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX M is attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit III. (HX II is discussed below.) DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on June 26, 2008. The record closed on July 1, 2008.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Egypt, and Applicant did not object. I took administrative notice as requested by \nDepartment Counsel (Tr. 46). The request for administrative notice and supporting \ndocumentation are attached to the record as HX II. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out below in my findings of fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR and offered explanations. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old test technician for a federal contractor. He has worked \nfor his current employer since March 2003. He has never held a security clearance (GX \n1 at 26).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the past 18 months describes him as respectful, \ndedicated, extraordinarily helpful, and a \u201ctake-charge person\u201d who presents creative \nideas (AX A). A co-worker describes him as dedicated and reliable (AX B). Another co-\nworker describes him as \u201cvery goal driven\u201d and dedicated (AX C). A third co-worker \ndescribes him as hard-working, reliable, trustworthy, and candid (AX D). \n \n \nApplicant was born and educated in Egypt. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering from Cairo University in 1965. He served in the Egyptian Army \nfrom May 1968 to July 1982 and retired as a colonel.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified he was a second-class citizen in Egypt because he is a \nChristian. He testified he was forced to retire as a colonel because officers selected to \nbe generals are given government positions after retirement, but government positions \nare not given to Christians (AX J; Tr. 75-76). \n \nApplicant worked as an electronics engineer and part-time teaching assistant for \nthe American University in Cairo, Egypt from January 1986 to until 1997 (AX G; Tr. 59-\n60). His colleagues and supervisors were impressed with his technical skill, dedication, \nintegrity, and loyalty (AX K and L).  \n \nApplicant began working as a radio engineer for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, \nEgypt in October 1988, where he had access to sensitive information. He, his wife, and \ntheir son emigrated from Egypt to Canada in 1993. They applied for U.S. immigration \nvisas, which they received in 1995. Applicant continued to work for the embassy and \nAmerican University until 1997, traveling between Canada and his jobs in Cairo. He \nreceived cash awards for superior performance at the embassy in December 1989 and \nJanuary 1993, and certificates of appreciation for his performance during a visit to the \nembassy by the President of the U.S. in November 1990, visits of the Vice-President of \nthe U.S. to the embassy in 1994 and 1996, and visits of the White House staff during \nAugust 1994 to April 1995 (GX 2 at 4-10).  \n \nApplicant returned to the U.S. in 1997, and he has worked for federal contractors \nin the U.S. since his return. He believes he will lose his job if his application for a \nclearance is denied (Tr. 55). \n \n \nApplicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in April 2001, and he obtained a U.S. \npassport in November 2001 (GX 5). He retained his Egyptian passport after becoming a \nU.S. citizen (GX 4), but he did not use it after obtaining a U.S. passport (GX 6 at 1). The \nEgyptian passport expired in February 2002. On June 19, 2008, he surrendered it to his \nfacility security officer, who destroyed it (AX M).   \n \nApplicant married an Egyptian woman in March 1973. His spouse is a dual \ncitizen of Egypt and Canada. She attempted to emigrate from Canada to the U.S. in \n1997, when Applicant returned from Egypt, but was informed she no longer had a visa. \nShe remained in Canada and became a Canadian citizen. She moved from Canada to \nthe U.S. in August 2004, sponsored by Applicant. She is now a permanent alien \nresident of the U.S. and resides with Applicant. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship \n(Tr. 67). They have one son, who is a U.S. citizen (Tr. 67). His spouse\u2019s mother and \nbrother are citizens of Egypt. Her mother lives in Egypt and her brother lives in Saudi \nArabia where he works for a construction company. Her brother supports their mother, \nwho is not employed and lives alone (Tr. 85). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased (Tr. 62). He has a brother who became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in March 1993 and resides in the U.S. He has two sisters who \nare citizens and residents of Egypt. Both sisters are married to Egyptian citizens and \nare housewives. They both live in Cairo. One sister is married to a retired artist, and she \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhas two children, a son who is a medical doctor and a daughter who is a pharmacist \nand a citizen and resident of England (Tr. 71-72). His other sister is married to a retired \nengineer and has two daughters, one a software engineer and another who is not \nworking (Tr. 72). He contacts his sisters one or two times a year by telephone. Neither \nsister nor their spouses are connected to any foreign government and neither sister is \naware that Applicant is being considered for a security clearance. He has not visited \neither sister in person since 1995 (GX 1 at 19-21; GX 6 at 2; GX 7 at 2). \n \nApplicant receives military retirement pay of about $500 a month from the \nEgyptian government (Tr. 62). He and his family also are entitled to health care benefits \nin Egypt, based on his status as a retired military officer. He is unwilling to renounce his \nEgyptian citizenship because he would forfeit his retirement pay if he did so (Tr. 74-75).  \n \nApplicant has rented an apartment in Cairo, Egypt since 1971. He has kept it \nbecause he has a grandfathered lease that costs him only about $5 per month. He \nestimates it would now cost $400-500 per month for a comparable apartment. He has \nnot used it since he moved to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen, except for a short \ntime when he visited Egypt in 2007 in an unsuccessful attempt to arrange a marriage for \nhis son (AX J at 4; GX 7 at 1; Tr. 73, 80). \n \nApplicant purchased a home in the U.S. in 1998. The loan is paid off, and the \nhouse is worth about $140,000 (Tr. 77). He has about $25,000 in his retirement account \nTr. 78). \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts. Egypt is a republic with a \nstrong executive, a legislature with 444 popularly elected members and 10 members \nappointed by the president, and a judicial system based on the continental legal system. \nUnder the current president, the courts have demonstrated increasing independence, \nand the principles of due process and judicial review have gained wider acceptance. \nEgypt is the most populous country in the Arab world, with a developing economy and \none of the largest armed forces in the region. The U.S. and Egypt have a strong and \nfriendly relationship based on shared interests in achieving Middle East peace, regional \nsecurity and stability, and strong economic relations. The U.S. has provided Egypt with \nextensive military and economic assistance, and has helped Egypt to modernize its \narmed forces. The two countries regularly engage in combined military exercises, \nincluding deployments of U.S. forces to Egypt. Although Egypt has suffered a series of \ndeadly terrorist attacks, its strong opposition to terrorism and its effective intelligence \nand security services have made Egypt unattractive to terrorist groups. Nevertheless, \nthe northern Sinai region is a haven for criminal networks that smuggle weapons and \nfunds among Egypt, Gaza, and Israel. Terrorist organizations, including those operating \nin Egypt, target the U.S. for intelligence to exploit and undermine U.S. national security \ninterests. Egypt\u2019s human rights record is generally poor because of limitations on \npolitical activity, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, poor prison conditions, and torture \nand abuse of detainees.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse is a dual citizen of Egypt and Canada and \nresides with him in the U.S. (\u00b6 1.a); his brother is a dual citizen of Egypt and the U.S. \nand resides in the U.S. (\u00b6 1.b); his two sisters are citizens and residents of Egypt (\u00b6 \n1.c); he receives military retirement pay from Egypt based on his service in the Egyptian \narmy (\u00b6 1.d); he owns an apartment in Egypt (1.e); and he traveled to Egypt \u201cin at least \nor after\u201d March 2007 (\u00b6 1.f). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \n\n \n7 \n \n \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant displayed some antipathy and resentment toward Egypt \nas a result of his forced retirement from the Army and treatment as a second class \ncitizen because of his religion. Antipathy toward a foreign government is not dispositive \nunder Guideline B, because a person can be vulnerable to foreign influence without \nhaving any positive or favorable feelings toward the foreign government. See ISCR \nCase No. 99-0424 at 36-37 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001), 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59.  \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). In \nassessing whether there is a \u201cheightened risk,\u201d the issue is whether the risk of foreign \ninfluence is greater than it would be if the person resided in the U.S. The term \u201cforeign\u201d \nis broader than officially recognized governments and extends to non-U.S. and anti-U.S. \ngroups operating in a foreign country. A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002). The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003).  \n \nThe citizenship and residences of Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and grandchildren \nwere not alleged in the SOR. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be \nconsidered: A(a) to assess an applicant=s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant=s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether \nan applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a \nparticular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide \nevidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.@ ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). Additionally, the Appeal Board \nhas determined that even though crucial security concerns are not alleged in the SOR, \nthe Judge may consider those security concerns when they are relevant and factually \nrelated to a disqualifying condition that was alleged in the SOR. ISCR 05-01820 at 3 n.4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 8 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2003) \nand ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)). I have considered the \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and grandchildren for the \nlimited purpose of evaluating the totality of his family ties in Egypt, evaluating his \nvulnerability to indirect foreign influence exercised through his spouse and sisters, and \nin my whole person analysis set out below. I conclude AG \u00b6 7(a) is raised. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). For the same reasons applicable to AG \u00b6 7(a), I conclude AG \u00b6 7(b) also is raised. \n \n \nA security concern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a \nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). \nApplicant\u2019s spouse obtained Canadian citizenship after leaving Egypt, and she now \nresides in the U.S. and intends to become a U.S. citizen. Her dual citizenship, based \nsolely on her place of birth and parentage, does not raise a significant security concern. \nHowever, the presence of her mother in Egypt raises a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of indirect \nattempts to influence Applicant through his spouse and her mother. Based on the \npresence of Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law in Egypt, I conclude AG \u00b6 7(d) also is raised. \n \n \nA security concern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated \nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(e). Although Applicant\u2019s apartment is now quite valuable, his \nreluctance to surrender it is based on its bargain rental rate, not its resale value or \nsentimental value. Because it is a rental property, it has no resale value to Applicant. He \nhas used it only once since he moved to the U.S. On the other hand, his military \nretirement pay is economically important to him. I conclude that his entitlement to \ncontinued military retirement pay raises AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), (d), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant has infrequent contact with his sisters and their families, \nbut has feelings of obligation toward them. He has not rebutted the presumption that he \nhas feelings of affection or obligation toward his mother-in-law. Egypt and the U.S. are \nfriends and allies, and there is no evidence that Egyptian intelligence services target the \nU.S. Thus, it is unlikely that the Egyptian government would cut off Applicant\u2019s military \nretirement pay to gain information from him. Nevertheless, terrorist and criminal \nelements operating in Egypt pose the threat of placing Applicant in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of his family members and the interests of the U.S. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to Egypt appears to be minimal, but his sense \nof loyalty or obligation to his family members is not minimal. On the other hand, he has \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S. He worked for the U.S. Embassy in \nCairo for almost nine years after his retirement for the Egyptian Army. He was trusted \nand highly regarded by embassy officials. He also worked for almost 11 years at the \nAmerican University in Cairo, a non-governmental organization, but one that projects \nU.S. influence in the area. He has worked for U.S. government contractors continuously \nsince 1997. He, his son, and his brother are U.S. citizens, and his spouse intends to \nbecome a U.S. citizen. He owns a home in the U.S. He allowed his Egyptian passport to \nexpire in 2002, and he used his U.S. passport when he visited Egypt in 2007. He \nrecently surrendered his expired passport to his facility security officer so that it could be \ndestroyed. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c).  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his sisters are infrequent, but he has not rebutted the \npresumption that they are not casual. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Egypt was solely to assist his son in an unsuccessful attempt \nto marry an Egyptian woman. He used his U.S. passport for this visit. I conclude his visit \nto Egypt in March 2007 has no independent security significance. See ISCR Case No. \n02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant served in the Egyptian Army for 18 years while an \nEgyptian citizen and before becoming a U.S. citizen (\u00b6 2.a), he desires to retain his \nEgyptian citizenship to remain eligible to receive his military retirement pay (\u00b6 2.b), and \nhe receives military retirement pay from the Egyptian Army (\u00b6 2.c).  \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a \nway as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or \nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. Dual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient \nto warrant an adverse security clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 \nWL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an \napplicant is a dual national, but rather whether an applicant shows a preference for a \nforeign country through actions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may arise from \u201cexercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d \nincluding but not limited to \u201cmilitary service,\u201d \u201caccepting educational, medical, \nretirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country\u201d or \u201cusing \nforeign citizenship to protect financial or other business interests in another country.\u201d \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(2), (3) and (4). Applicant\u2019s military service occurred before he became a \nU.S. citizen, and it does not raise a disqualifying condition. However, his acceptance of \nmilitary retirement pay and the medical benefits associated with his status as a retired \nmilitary officer and his unwillingness to cause termination of his retirement pay by \nrelinquishing his Egyptian citizenship raise this disqualifying condition, shifting the \nburden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). Applicant acquired Egyptian citizenship at birth, but he has continued to exercise \nit by receiving military retirement pay from the Egyptian government. Thus, I conclude \nAG \u00b6 11(a) is not established. No other enumerated mitigating conditions are \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult with strong ties to the U.S. and a long \nrecord of service to the U.S. He does not have the financial resources to retire, and he \nfeels that an adverse clearance decision will cost him his current job. He has a modest \nincome, and he relies on his military retirement pay to support himself and his family. \nHowever, Athe consequences to an applicant=s career and the financial well-being of \n\n \n11 \n \n \nhimself or his family are not a relevant consideration in an adjudication of an applicant=s \nsecurity eligibility.@ ISCR Case No. 02-09220 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2004). Applicant \nmade it clear at the hearing that he is unwilling to relinquish his military retirement pay. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence, but he has not \nmitigated the security concerns based on his exercise of Egyptian citizenship. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He denied the \nfinancial considerations allegation with explanation.  He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  Department counsel was prepared to proceed on January 31, \n2008.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 1, 2008, and \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreassigned to me on February 13, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March \n19, 2008, for a hearing on April 30, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The \ngovernment offered four exhibits, marked Government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, \nwhich were received without objection.  Applicant submitted four documents, marked \nApplicant Exhibits A-D, which were received without objections.  Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf.  The record was left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  \nApplicant timely submitted one document, marked Applicant Exhibit E.  The document \nwas admitted to the record without objection from Department Counsel.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008.  Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and has worked for the past three years as an \nelectrician in a Navy shipyard.  He now works in the same shipyard on electrical designs \nfor ships.  He served almost eight years on active duty in the Navy as an electrician, \nand held a security clearance while on active duty. (Applicant Exhibit A, Discharge Form \n214, dated June 16, 2003)  He was married but is now divorced and he has not re-\nmarried.  There were no children born of the marriage. He receives a thirty percent \nVeteran\u2019s Administration disability as a result of his Navy service. (Tr. 22-24; \nGovernment Exhibit 1, Electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing (e-QIP), \ndated November 30, 2006) \n \nApplicant and his wife divorced in December 2001 when Applicant was on active \nduty.  Applicant took all of his personal items from their home and moved back to his \nship which was about to deploy.  Applicant\u2019s wife had the divorce papers drafted, and \nhe signed them in a car dealer\u2019s parking lot for his wife.  Applicant\u2019s agreement with his \nwife was for him to assume all credit card and furniture debts from the marriage.  His \nwife was to keep their car and to assume payments on the vehicle.  He does not know if \nthe payment agreement was in the papers or if it was verbal.   \n \nApplicant paid the credit cards debt of about $6,000, and the furniture bill of \nabout $2,000.  Credit reports show that the debt for the car is delinquent for $13,162.  \nThe original purchase price was about $16,522.  Applicant assumes his wife made \nsome of the payments.  He did not know the debt was delinquent until he purchased a \ncondominium in November 2005, and when he received the SOR in November 2006. \n(Tr. 28-30; Government Exhibit 2, credit report, dated November 30, 2006; See also, \nGovernment Exhibit 3, Interrogatories, dated October 29, 2007, at 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current credit report shows he pays his debts as agreed.  The only \ndelinquent debt listed is for the car payment noted above.  (Government Exhibit 3, credit \nreport, dated October 12, 2007, at 6-20; Government Exhibit 4, Credit report, dated April \n23, 2008)  Applicant has not been able to contact his wife since 2002.  He requested \ncopies of the divorce papers from the courts but only received a copy of a divorce \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndecree.  (See, Government Exhibit 3, Interrogatories, dated October 29, 2007, at 5; \nApplicant Exhibit E, e-mail, dated May 28, 2008) \n \nApplicant has not contacted the creditor because he does not believe he should \npay the debt because of the agreement with his former wife.  He acknowledges co-\nsigning the loan agreement with his former wife.  Applicant received a loan to purchase \na condominium in 2005, and a car loan in September 2007. (Tr. 19-32; Applicant Exhibit \nB, Condominium receipt, dated November 10, 2005; Applicant Exhibit C, Loan \nagreement, dated September 7, 2007).  Applicant also has extensive funds in his \nshipyard 401K account.  (Applicant Exhibit D, account statement, dated March 25, \n2008).  Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement shows monthly income of $3,165, with \nmonthly expenses of $1,785 leaving monthly discretionary funds of approximately \n$1,100.  This income does not include income from his Veteran\u2019s Administration \ndisability.  (Government Exhibit 3, Interrogatories, dated October 29, 2007, at 4).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent car debt is a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations),   \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  Applicant has one debt that is still \npast due.  Since the debt has not been paid, it casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) and it applies.  The debt arose \nfrom Applicant\u2019s divorce.  He was to pay credit card and furniture bills and his former \nwife was to assume payment of the car debt. Applicant paid his part of the agreement \n\n \n5 \n \n \nshowing that he acted responsibly.  It was his wife that did not fulfill her part of the \nagreement.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  Applicant does not believe he \nhas an obligation to pay the debt.  He has not made any arrangements to pay the debt \nso the mitigating condition does not apply.   \n \n \nSince Applicant signed the loan agreement with his wife for the car, he does \nhave a legal obligation to pay the debt.  Even though he does have a legal obligation for \nthe debt, this obligation may not result in a security concern.  There is a security \nconcern for a failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations.  Applicant has shown he is living within his means, that he satisfies \nhis debts, and that he meets his financial obligations.  He has a reasonable objection to \npaying a debt that should be paid by his wife.  He may have a legal obligation to pay the \ndebt but his failure to pay it under the circumstances does not show he is not living \nwithin his means, that he does not satisfy his debts, and does not meet his financial \nobligations.  His refusal to pay the car debt does not show that he has poor self-control, \nthat he lacks judgment, or that he has an unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations.  His financial information shows that he is not financially overextended and \nthat he is not at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  His refusal to \npay the debt under the circumstances does not show he is financially irresponsible, and \ndoes not raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Applicant has presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant\u2019s \nalmost eight years of active duty in the Navy during which he successfully held a \nsecurity clearance.  I considered that his one financial issue was caused by his wife\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfailure to pay a car loan that she was obligated to pay by her divorce from Applicant.  I \nconsidered that Applicant\u2019s other financial obligations are paid as agreed, that he has \nbeen granted loans from other financial institutions, and he has a positive balance in his \nretirement account.  He manages his finances in a manner that does not create a \nsecurity concern.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 19, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on January 9, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 14, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on January 30, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, \nFebruary 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through Z, without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to \nkeep the record open until February 11, 2007, to submit additional matters.  Applicant \nsubmitted her letter dated February 5, 2008 (AE AA), copies of checks (AE BB), and \ncopies of bank statements (AE CC), without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is \nmarked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The record closed on February 11, 2007. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 11, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing the amount of the \ndebt in \u00b6 1.b from \u201c$2,401\u201d to \u201c$361.\u201d Applicant did not object and the motion was \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 19, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.i, 1.m, 1.n, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t of the SOR, with \nexplanations. She denied the remaining allegations. She also provided additional \ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She attended \ncollege but did not obtain a degree. She is married for the fourth time. Her first two \nmarriages ended in divorce. Her second husband is deceased. She separated from her \nthird husband shortly after they were married, but the marriage ended when he passed \naway. She has two children from her first marriage; ages 23 and 19; two children from \nher second marriage, ages 15 and 12; and an adult stepchild from her current \nmarriage.1  \n \n \nApplicant has had financial issues for a number of years.  She was married to her \nsecond husband from about 1992 to 1997. He did not work but liked to spend what he \nhad not earned. They went through a difficult divorce and he did not pay his share of the \ndebts or child support for their two children. He passed away in about 2001, owing \nApplicant about $24,000 in back child support. Applicant was a single mother with four \nchildren and she could not pay her debts. She filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in about \nOctober 1998. Her debts of approximately $30,000 were discharged in about February \n1999.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was laid off in April 2005. He found work with a temporary \nagency, but did not obtain permanent employment until about June 2006, at a much \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 55, 76-81; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-22, 54-56, 79; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nlesser salary than before he was laid off. Applicant lost her job in about June 2005. She \nfound sporadic work as a waitress and a bartender but did not resume full time \nemployment until January 2007. Applicant and her husband had a total income in 2004 \nof almost $159,000, which included about $23,000 withdrawn from Applicant\u2019s \nretirement account. Their total income for 2005 was about $172,000, which included \nabout $95,800 withdrawn from her husband\u2019s 401(k) retirement account. Income taxes \nwere withheld from the withdrawals from the retirement accounts in 2004 and 2005. \nTheir total income in 2006 was about $50,000. They bought a house before they lost \ntheir jobs and were involved in remodeling the house. They used the money withdrawn \nfrom the 401(k) to pay off the contractors and subcontractors but the house went to \nforeclosure. They had equity in the house and sold the house before foreclosure. They \nmade about $50,000 net profit from the sale. They used a sizable amount of that money \nfor the costs of renting and moving to their new home.3  \n \n \nApplicant became very ill after she lost her job. Her medical insurance was \nthrough her husband\u2019s employment. They could not afford to maintain the very high \npremiums after they both lost their jobs and they lost their medical insurance. They \nincurred substantial medical bills that they are still paying. One of Applicant\u2019s children \nhas a severe learning disability which was very expensive to diagnose and treat. \nAnother child has emotional problems and incurred costs for counseling and treatment.4   \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling approximately $17,188. Individual \ndebts are discussed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a debt of $361 to a telephone/internet company placed in \ncollection with a collection company in about October 2001. Applicant denied this debt \nand stated it belonged to her deceased ex-husband.  She testified she has never used \nthat telephone/internet provider and that the service was for an address where she has \nnever lived. She stated the address is where her deceased ex-husband and his widow \nlived. The debt of $413 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is to the same collection agency as in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, on behalf of a cable company. Applicant denied this debt and stated she \nnever lived in the city covered by this cable company. She sent dispute letters to the \ncollection company on December 20, 2007, but has not yet received a response about \neither debt. The credit bureau report (CBR) of January 4, 2008, lists the debt as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. It also lists the collection agency, amount, and account number for the \ndebt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and states the account is disputed. However, it lists the \nunderlying creditor as the cable company from SOR \u00b6 1.c, instead of the \ntelephone/internet company in SOR \u00b6 1.b.5 \n \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 44-47, 53; GE 1; AE X-Z. \n \n4 Tr. at 47-49, 90. \n \n5 Tr. at 28-31, 71-74; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE H, I. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the debt of $422 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. She stated she \nthought she paid the debt. She sent a letter to the creditor on December 20, 2007, \nasking to start paying $50 per month in January 2008. She testified that she mailed the \nfirst payment, but the check had not cleared her bank as of the date of the hearing.6 \n \n \nApplicant stated the debt of $4,340 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was to a home \nimprovement retailer. She has made arrangements to pay $100 per month. She made \n$100 payments in November and December 2007 and January 2008.7 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a debt of $1,384 to a collection company for an account placed \nin collection in 2001. The underlying creditor is not named. Applicant stated she has no \nidea who the creditor is and that she has never received a phone call or letter from this \ncreditor. This debt is listed on the CBR of October 12, 2007 and the CBR of October 23, \n2007, submitted by Applicant with her response to Interrogatories. It is not listed on the \nCBR of February 27, 2007, or the most recent CBR of January 4, 2008.8 \n \n \n \nApplicant initially denied but later admitted the debt of $840 to a collection \ncompany on behalf of an athletic club, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The account number \nassociated with this debt only appears on the CBR of October 12, 2007. SOR \u00b6 1.o \nalleges a debt of $1,061 to the same collection company. The evidence indicates these \nare duplicates and represent the same debts. Applicant sent a letter to the collection \ncompany on December 20, 2007, asking to start paying $50 per month and included a \n$50 payment.9 \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debt of $1,291 to a financial institution as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.h. The creditor responded to Applicant on January 7, 2008, and stated they were \ndeleting the account from her credit file.10  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. lists a debt to an automobile financing company of $2,639, which was \ncharged off in 1998. This was a 36 month auto lease. Applicant stated this debt was \nincluded in her bankruptcy and she did not reaffirm the debt. She testified that the \nvehicle was in her name but her ex-husband kept it after the divorce. His wife told \nApplicant that the vehicle was repossessed at some point after his 2001 death. The \ndebt is not listed on the two most recent CBRs submitted as evidence.11 \n \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 31-32; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE L. \n \n7 Tr. at 32-33; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3-5; AE BB. \n \n8 Tr. at 37-38; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5. \n \n9 Tr. at 38; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5; AE C, W. \n \n10 Tr. at 38-39; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE K, Q. \n \n11 Tr. at 22-26, 39; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a debt of $1,105 to a financial institution for a credit card \naccount. Applicant denied owing this debt and did not recognize the creditor. This debt \nis listed on the CBRs submitted as evidence, but they all indicate a zero balance on the \naccount.12 \n \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $654 debt to a gas and electric utility as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. She stated this was for power at her ex-husband\u2019s house and she has never \nlived at that address. She contacted the utility company and disputed the debt. She was \nwaiting for a response. The debt is not listed on the two most recent CBRs submitted as \nevidence.13 \n \n \nThe $203 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l is to a collection company on behalf of a \ntelephone services company. Applicant stated she never had an account with this \ncompany. The debt is not listed on the three most recent CBRs submitted as \nevidence.14 \n \n \nApplicant and her family had extensive medical issues and a number of medical \ndebts. She paid many bills in addition to what was alleged in the SOR. She admitted \nowing the two $50 medical debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n, but indicated she \nwas unaware she owed the debts as she never received notification of the debts. The \ndebts were being collected by the same collection agency. The CBRs listed different \naccount numbers and addresses for the collection agency. She sent $50 checks to both \naddresses, but one was returned as not deliverable as addressed. It appears Applicant \nmay have been one digit off on the address. SOR \u00b6 1.p alleges a medical debt of $850 \nto a collection agency. She sent a letter to the collection company on December 20, \n2007, asking to start paying $50 per month and included a $50 payment. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q \nand 1.r allege medical debts to a collection agency in the amounts of $154 and $284. \nShe sent letters to the creditor on December 20, 2007, asking to start paying $50 per \nmonth in January 2008. She submitted proof that she made two $50 payments in \nJanuary 2008. SOR \u00b6 1.t alleges a medical debt of $340 to a collection agency. The \ndebt rose to $500 with interest. Applicant initiated a payment schedule of $50 per month \nstarting in June 2007. She made seven monthly payments of $50 and lowered her \nbalance to $150, with the last payment scheduled for February 2008.15 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $747 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s. She has \nmade arrangements to pay $100 per month and made a payment of $103 on December \n28, 2007.16 \n \n                                                          \n12 Tr. at 39; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5. \n \n13 Tr. at 39-40; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5. \n \n14 Tr. at 40-41; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5. \n \n15 Tr. at 41-44; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, B, F, G, P-W. \n \n16 Tr. at 43; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE N, W. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nIn addition to the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has paid other debts. She \nowes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and her state for back taxes. Applicant and \nher husband have made regular payments for the past few years through automatic \ndeduction of $115 per month to the IRS and $118 per month to their state. The IRS and \nthe state also keep any refund due Applicant and her husband.17 \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. She and her husband are \nconsidering it but they are concerned because of the number of companies in that \nbusiness that are not reputable. Unlike some of her previous husbands, Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent husband is a responsible individual. He adopted Applicant\u2019s two youngest \nchildren and is supportive of their combined efforts to resolve their finances. They plan \non paying their delinquent debts. Once one debt is paid they will concentrate on paying \nanother. She testified that they hope to have their delinquent debt paid by the end of \nthis year.18 \n \n \nApplicant has worked for her current employer since January 2007. She is very \nhighly regarded and received a promotion from a supervisor position to a manager \nposition after six months. Character letters on her behalf describe Applicant as a \nconsummate professional, intelligent, self-motivated, dedicated, efficient, dependable, \ntrustworthy, and mature, with a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and ambition.19 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n                                                          \n17 Tr. at 50-53, 70; AE AA, CC. \n \n18 Tr. at 63-66, 80-81, 91. \n \n19 AE O. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay her \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second husband did not work but liked to spend money. He did not \naccept responsibility for their debts or his children after the divorce. He died in 2001, \nowing Applicant about $24,000 in child support. Applicant was on her own with four \nchildren and could not pay all the debts. She filed for bankruptcy and had her debts \ndischarged in about 1999.  She was back on track by 2005, then both she and her \nhusband lost their jobs. Applicant did not resume full time employment until January \n2007. Her husband also was underemployed through at least 2006. They lost their \nmedical coverage and their financial problems were aggravated by a series of costly \nmedical expenses for Applicant and her children. These are conditions that were largely \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control. They have been repaying their debts since they both started \n\n \n9 \n \n \nworking again, including debts and medical costs that were not alleged in the SOR. I \nfind her behavior was responsible under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable. \nThey have payment plans for several debts and are still waiting to hear from some \ncreditors, but Applicant is committed to paying all the debts that are legitimately hers. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially applicable. She has not received counseling, but there are clear \nindications that her financial problems are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant disputed a number of the debts. She stated some of the debts \nbelonged to her ex-husband. The manner in which the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c are listed on the CBRs provides a basis to question their legitimacy. The debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.o appear to be duplicates. A number of the debts, including those in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g. 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l, are not listed on the most recent CBRs in evidence. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j is listed on the CBRs submitted as evidence, but they all indicate \na zero balance on the account. The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.h responded to Applicant in a \nletter and stated they were deleting the account from her credit file. AG \u00b6 20(e) is at \nleast partially applicable to the above allegations in the SOR.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant went through a difficult \nmarriage in the 1990s. After her divorce she was unable to cover her living expenses as \na single mother and ended up filing for bankruptcy. She met her new husband and their \nfinances were in order until they both lost their jobs in 2005. They lost their medical \ncoverage and incurred substantial medical bills for Applicant and her children. Since \nthey returned to work, she paid several debts, disputed some debts, and has payment \nplans in effect for other debts. Applicant is highly regarded by her company and was \npromoted to a manager position after six months. She credibly testified that she is \ncommitted to paying all the debts that are legitimately hers. Applicant\u2019s finances are not \nperfect. However, the issue is not whether Applicant has unpaid debts; the issue is \nwhether Applicant\u2019s debts make her a security risk. I find they do not.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEDWARD W.

On March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 25, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR on April 10, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. On June 30,\n2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of eight\nexhibits (Items 1-8). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed\nSeptember 25, 2008\n\nIn the enrolled creditor list, Applicant included an account number for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d held by\n1\nthe collection agency but not for the original creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. His credit report of June 2007\nshows that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the assignee collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. \n2\nhim to respond within 30 days of receipt. No response was received by the August 8,\n2008, due date. On September 15, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM, including\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4), eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\n13 delinquent debts totaling $7,513 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m). Applicant admitted the\nallegations, and provided documentation of a settlement offer of a $2,600.15 debt that\nwas not alleged.

A check of Applicant\u2019s\ncredit on June 16, 2007 (Item 7), revealed several past due balances charged off and/or\nin collection.\nDOHA submitted interrogatories to Applicant in or before November 2007, asking\nhim to document the current status of the debts listed in the June 2007 credit report.\nApplicant provided a debt negotiation agreement signed by him on November 15, 2007.\nIn return for a monthly payment of $176.04, the debt resolution firm was to negotiate\nwith the creditors listed under the plan, including those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.m,1\nas well as with some creditors not listed in the SOR. The amount of total debt to be\nresolved in the plan was $9,992.15, although the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d was listed twice, as\na $987 balance owed the collection agency and a $970 debt owed the original creditor.\nApplicant authorized the debt resolution firm to deduct $176.04 from his checking\naccount on a monthly basis starting December 15, 2007. Applicant had $375.84 in a\nchecking account as of October 26, 2007 (Item 6).\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial delinquency is reflected in the following table.\nDebt \nDelinquency history\nRepayment Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a $379 telephone\ndebt, in collection\n$379 for collection Sep 06\n(Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), Feb 08 credit report as\nunpaid (Item 8), no proof\nof payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.b $225 satellite\ntelevision debt, in\ncollection\n$225 for collection as of\nAug 06 (Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), Feb 08 credit report as\nunpaid (Item 8), no proof\nof payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.c $221 satellite\ntelevision debt, in\ncollection\n$221 for collection as of\nDec 03, no activity since\nSep 02 (Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), Feb 08 credit report as\nunpaid (Item 8), no proof\nof payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.d $1,004 debt, in\ncollection\nUpdated balance of SOR \u00b6\n1.m (Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan as\n$987 (Item 6), Feb 08\ncredit report as $1004\nbalance (Item 8), no proof\nof payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.e $404 telephone\nservices debt, in collection\n$404 for collection Jun 06,\nlast activity Feb 04 (Items\n7, 8)\nOn Feb 08 credit report as\nunpaid as of Oct 07 (Item\n8), no proof of payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.f $312\ncommunications services\ndebt, in collection\n$312 for collection as of\nJul 05 (Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), Feb 08 credit report as\nunpaid (Item 8), no proof\nof payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.g $848 debt,\ncharged off\nRevolving charge opened\nApr 01, $350 credit limit,\n$848 in collection, no\nactivity since Jun 01\n(Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), Feb 08 credit report as\nunpaid (Item 8), no proof\nof payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.h $137 debt,\ncharged off\n$127 past due balance\nowed since Nov 04,\ncharged off Mar 05, for\ncollection (Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan as\n$127 (Item 6), Feb 08\ncredit report as charge off\n(Item 8), no proof of\npayment\n\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1.i $763 debt,\ncharged off\nInstallment sales contract\nopened Sep 06, high credit\n$863, $763 balance\ntransferred Jan 07 (Item 8)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), Feb 08 credit report as\ncharge off (Item 8), no\nproof of payment\nSOR \u00b6 1.j $480 debt,\ncharged off\n$780 loan taken out Apr\n06, $480 charged off\nbalance in collection Sep\n06 (Items 7, 8)\nDebt repayment plan as\n$544.15 (Item 6), Feb 08\ncredit report as $499 past\ndue (Item 8), no proof of\npayment\nSOR \u00b6 1.k $944 utility\nservices debt, in collection \nLast activity Mar 05, for\ncollection Apr 05, $944\ncharged off by assignee\nMay 07 (Item 7)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), no proof of payments\nSOR \u00b6 1.l $826 debt, in\ncollection\n$710 debt charged off May\n06, $826 bal May 07 (Item\n7)\nDebt repayment plan (Item\n6), no proof of payments\nSOR \u00b6 1.m $970 debt, in\ncollection\nRevolving charge opened\nSep 03, $845 high credit,\ncharged off balance.

The record does not contain any evidence that he paid\n2\nthe settlement amount.3\nA subsequent check of Applicant\u2019s credit on February 7, 2008, showed that a\n$97 debt (not alleged) had been paid after collection, but that no progress had been\nmade on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j. Applicant had been late twice since May 2007 on\nhis car loan taken out in January 2006 (Item 8). The $1,398 delinquent cellular phone\ndebt (not alleged), and those debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k. and 1.l, all undisputed by Applicant,\ndid not appear on the credit report. \nFollowing his discharge from the Army, Applicant attended a technical institute\nfrom which he received an \u201cAOS\u201d degree in microcomputers in December 1999. From\nMay 2000 to May 2007, he was employed as a technical services representative for a\nsatellite television provider. He began his present employment in early June 2007 (Item\n5). The available record contains no information about his income or expenses. He has\nbeen married since July 1992 (Item 5). There is no indication that he and his spouse\nhave any children.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n6\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admits financial delinquency in excess of the $7,513 alleged in the\nSOR. His credit reports and other financial records (the debt repayment plan and recent\nsettlement offer) reflect past due balances totaling about $12,140 as of late 2007.\nSignificant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\n\n7\nMany of the debts in the SOR were referred for collection within the past three\nyears. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are therefore too recent to satisfy mitigating\ncondition AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). His e-QIP\nshows that he has been steadily employed since May 2000.  There is no indication that\nhis debts were due to an unexpected expense or other factor, such as low income, that\ncould negate the reasonable inference of financial mismanagement generated by\nseveral delinquent accounts. AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) cannot be applied based on the\nfacts presented for review. \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided documentation of a debt\nrepayment plan under which the debts alleged in the SOR, and about $2,846 in\nadditional debt not alleged, would be eventually settled and/or satisfied in return for his\nmonthly payments of $176.04. While this qualifies as a good-faith effort to resolve the\ndebts under AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), it amounts to at best a promise to pay in the\nabsence of any evidence that the repayment plan had been accepted by his creditors\nand put into effect by the debt resolution firm. Applicant presented no proof of any\npayments on the debts even after he had been apprised of the government\u2019s concerns\nabout the premature nature of the debt resolution plan. Similarly, it is unclear whether\nhe settled the $2,600.15 debt owed on an account in collection that was neither alleged\nin the SOR nor included in the debt repayment plan (Item 4). AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully\napply, even though he is credited with satisfying the $97 debt (not alleged) and seeking\nthe assistance of a debt negotiation firm. In the absence of a documented track record\nof repayment, either directly to the creditors or through the debt resolution firm, AG \u00b6\n20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d), also does\nnot apply. He had $375.84 on deposit in a checking account as of late October 2007\n(Item 4). While this would be sufficient to cover a couple of monthly payments under the\ndebt repayment plan, it is unclear whether he can afford to keep up with the payments. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n8\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant made no effort to address his delinquent debt until November 2007,\nwhen he was apparently prompted by the clearance investigation and/or by\ninterrogatories from DOHA. He then sought the assistance of a debt resolution firm. His\nfailure to address his debts in a timely manner raises considerable doubts about his\nfinancial judgment. His February 2008 credit report shows he was making his payments\non his automobile loan, but also that he had been late twice since May 2007. While he\nis not required to satisfy or settle all his delinquent debts before he can be granted\naccess to classified information, he has yet to demonstrate that he can handle his\nfinancial obligations responsibly.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On June 23, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  The SOR was subsequently amended to add security concerns under\nGuideline F.  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On October 24,\n2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel timely cross-appealed pursuant to the aforesaid Directive provisions.\nThe following issues are raised by the appeal and cross-appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision under Guideline E is sustainable; whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision under Guideline\nJ is sustainable; and whether the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\n\nIn addition to his ten felony offenses, Applicant had five misdemeanor arrests for larceny by check or bad\n1\ncheck, two of which resulted in convictions, and one conviction for the misdemeanor offense of failure to return rental\nproperty.\n3\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n(1) Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline E should\nbe reversed and that the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision under Guideline J should be affirmed because\nthe Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had not deliberately falsified his security clearance\napplication.  The Board finds this argument persuasive.\nApplicant executed a security clearance application (SCA) on June 19, 2007.  In response to\nQuestion 23, which asked whether he \u201chad ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense,\u201d Applicant disclosed only a 1987 felony conviction for habitual traffic offender.  He did not\ndisclose ten other felony offenses which had occurred between 1986 and 1994, including two\nseparate perjury convictions in 1989 and 1990.  In response to Question 27, which asked whether\nApplicant had any unpaid judgments in the past seven years, Applicant stated \u201cno\u201d and failed to\ndisclose a 2002 unpaid judgement.\nWhen Applicant was questioned by a government investigator as to why he failed to disclose\nall of his felony charges and convictions, Applicant stated he listed only the one felony habitual\noffender driving charge \u201cbecause of feeling that all the charges were related, including the perjury\ncharge and therefor did not feel it was necessary to list the additional charges.\u201d  This explanation was\ninconsistent with another statement to the investigator, that his perjury conviction was related to a\nprevious bad check conviction.  Moreover, his first perjury conviction came two years after his 1987\nhabitual offender offense.  Applicant did not offer any further explanation as to the omission of his\nmultiple felony offenses in his two answers or his reply to the government\u2019s file of relevant material.\nApplicant asserted that he did not disclose his 2002 judgement because he thought it had been paid.\nHowever, the evidence indicated that it was still owing.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written record.  As a result, the Judge did\nnot have an opportunity to question Applicant about his omissions and observe his demeanor.  In\nsuch circumstances, the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination as to Applicant\u2019s explanations\nfor his omissions are not entitled to the same deference on appeal that it would receive had it been\nmade in the context of a hearing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04302 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 30,\n2005). \nIn this case, Applicant had two prior felony convictions for perjury, as well as multiple\nconvictions relating to larceny by check.   In reaching her decision, the Judge did not give sufficient\n1\nweight to the extent to which those crimes of moral turpitude undermined Applicant\u2019s credibility and\nhis assertions that his failure to disclose multiple matters of obvious security concern was not\ndeliberate.  As to the issue of Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications, the Judge failed consider an\n\nSee Government Exhibits 9-13.\n2\n4\nimportant aspect of the case, failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for her favorable\nconclusion, and offered an explanation that ran contrary to the record evidence as a whole.  Because\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of the SCA is not otherwise mitigated, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under\nGuideline E is not sustainable.  \n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline J should be reversed\nbecause his criminal conduct is not recent, and that he has demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation to\nmitigate the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument to be\npersuasive.\nIn her decision, the Judge found against Applicant as to Guideline J stating: \u201cunder Guideline\nJ AG \u00b6 32(e), his felony convictions preclude him from holding a clearance unless a waiver is\ngranted.\u201d  Decision at 11.  This specific finding as to AG \u00b6 32(e) was an error.\nThe requirements set forth in Guideline J AG \u00b6 32(e) reflect legislation, the Smith\nAmendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986), which is no longer in effect.  It was repealed on January 28, 2008\nby the Bond Amendment (Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b).  The Bond Amendment continues the\nrequirement for disqualification for persons who were sentenced to and served imprisonment for\nmore than a year unless the individual receives a waiver for merit.  However, this disqualification\nnow only applies to prohibit favorable clearance adjudications that would provide access to Special\nAccess Programs (SAP), Restricted Data (RD), or other information commonly referred to as\nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) for covered individuals.  The statutory modification\nended the former Smith Amendment\u2019s applicability as to adjudications of \u201ccollateral\u201d security\nclearances.  The SOR in Applicant\u2019s case was issued on June 23, 2008, subsequent to the enactment\nof the Bond Amendment.  It was also issued after the Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Interim Guidance\nfor the implementation of the Bond Amendment.  Accordingly, the Smith Amendment-related\nprovision set forth at Guideline J AG \u00b6 32(e) does not apply in Applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 07-11963 at 5-6 (A.J. Aug. 20, 2008)(Decision containing a detailed explanation as to\nDirective modifications necessary as a result of the Bond Amendment).  However, because of the\nBoard\u2019s holding as to Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SCA, as set forth above, the Judge\u2019s\noverall adverse decision under Guideline J is sustainable on independent, alternative grounds.\nTherefore, on the facts of this case, the Judge\u2019s error in applying AG \u00b6 32(e) is harmless.\n(3) Finally, Department Counsel argues that the Judge erred by not treating the state court\njudgments  against Applicant, that were submitted by the government in their FORM, as prime facie\n2\nevidence to establish SOR paragraphs 3(b), (c) and (f).  The Judge discounted those judgments based\non Applicant\u2019s failure to list the underlying debts in his bankruptcy proceeding, her own discussion,\nwithout citation to the record, of the possibility that the debts could have been paid but never\nreported, and her otherwise erroneous finding that none of the judgments were in the credit reports.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument on this issue has merit.  The government was only responsible for\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n3\nId. at \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n4\n5\npresenting evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR that had been controverted.   Applicant\n3\nwas responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts proved by\nthe government, and had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.   \u201cOnce it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion . . . never shifts\n4\nto the government.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 06-26613 at 5 (A.J. Jul. 31, 2007).  For similar reasons as stated\nabove, the Judge\u2019s error is harmless in light of her ultimate decision.\nOrder\nThe ultimate decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned; Michael Y Ra\u2019anan       \nMichael Y.

On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR, which he answered on July 7, 2008. He requested a\ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOctober 24, 2008\n\nItem 3 (Response to SOR, dated July 7, 2008); Item 4 (Response to Amended SOR).\n1\nItem 5 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (E-QIP, also SF-86), dated June 19, 2007) at 1, 4, 7-8, 11-\n2\n12.\nItem 1 (SOR); Item 3, supra note 1; Item 4, supra 1.\n3\n2\nOn July 23, 2008, Department Counsel prepared an Amended SOR adding an\nadditional allegation under Guideline E and new allegations under Guideline F.\nDepartment Counsel mailed the Amended SOR to Applicant on this date. Applicant\nresponded to the Amended SOR on September 11, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on September 17, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nSeptember 17, 2008. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a written response\nbut no additional evidence on October 2, 2008. DOHA assigned this case to me on\nOctober 10, 2008. The government submitted 15 exhibits, which have been marked as\nItems 1-15 and admitted into the record. Applicant has not submitted any evidence in\nsupport of mitigation.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 7, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 2.a of the SOR. He denied all the new allegations listed in the\nAmended SOR, with explanations.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 41 years old, works as a laborer for a Department of Defense\ncontractor. He began his job with this employer in January 2006. He has three children,\nages 19, 12, and 11. He and his wife married in 2005.2\nAs a teenager and young adult, Applicant behaved contrary to the rules and laws\nof society. On October 29, 1986, December 15, 1986, and April 11, 1987, the police\narrested and charged Applicant on three separate occasions with larceny by check, a\nmisdemeanor offense. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to 30 days in jail\non his first arrest. The State nolle prosequi or dismissed the two remaining charges. On\nApril 28, 1987, the police again arrested Applicant and charged him with a bad check, a\nmisdemeanor offense, and on June 25, 1987, the police arrested and charged him with\na misdemeanor offense for failure to return rental property. The court found him guilty in\nboth cases. The record does not provide information on the sentence imposed, if any.   \n3\nOn September 28, 1987 and March 1, 1987, the police arrested and charged\nApplicant with bad check and making, drawing, uttering, and delivering a fraudulent\ncheck, felonies. The court found him guilty on the March 1, 1987 bad check charge.\nAgain, the record contains no information on the sentenced imposed, if any. In July\n1987, the police arrested and charged Applicant as a habitual traffic offender, a felony,\n\nId.; See State Code \u00b6 46.2-391.\n4\nId.\n5\nIn his interview, Applicant indicated that a neighborhood police officer stopped and arrested him when he was\n6\ndriving to or from work. He had no other method of transportation to work. Item 6 (Interrogatories, with\ntestimonies) at 3-4. \nId.; Item 1 (SOR); Item 3, supra note 1; Item 4, supra 1;See State Code \u00b6 46.2-391.\n7\nItem 7 (Bankruptcy court papers); Item 8 (Adverse Information Report, dated June 17, 2008); Item 14 (July\n8\n7, 2007 credit report); Item 15 (July 15, 2008 credit report covering the time period December 1998 to July\n2008); Response to FORM.\n3\nbased on his traffic offenses, failure to pay fines, and driving on a suspended license.\nThe court convicted him and sentenced him to five years in jail. He served 14 months in\njail and the remainder of his sentence on probation. The record contains no evidence\nwhich shows the basis for the habitual traffic offender arrest, except for Applicant\u2019s own\nstatements about his arrests.  \n4\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant with perjury, a felony, on August 25,\n1988. The court found him guilty on January 3, 1989, but the record contains no\ninformation on the sentence imposed, if any. The police arrested and charged him again\nas a habitual traffic offender, a felony, based on traffic offenses and a separate charge\nfor perjury on May 19, 1990. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to a total of\nseven years in jail. He served 14 to 18 months of his sentence.  \n5\nThe police arrested him twice more when he was driving a vehicle to work and\ncharged him as a habitual traffic offender, a felony, on December 9, 1992 and March\n23, 1993. The court sentenced him to one year in jail for each offense. He was\nincarcerated on January 26, 1994. He served six to eight months.  In 1995, Applicant\n6\npetitioned the court to have the habitual traffic offense ban lifted. The court granted his\nrequest. He has a valid drivers license and no additional arrests since 1993.7\nThe record contains two credit reports, dated July 7, 2007 and July 15, 2008.\nBoth reports indicate that Applicant pays his bills timely and as agreed, with two\nexceptions. Both reports indicate the court entered a judgment against Applicant in\nFebruary 2002, which Applicant denies owing, and an unpaid medical bill, which is not\nlisted in the Amended SOR. Neither credit report lists any other unpaid judgments\nagainst Applicant. Applicant self-reported that he and his wife filed a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy petition in March 2008 because he co-signed a note for another person who\ndefaulted on the note and the creditor was seeking payment from him. His case was still\nin process as of July 16, 2008.The above medical bill was included in the bankrupcty\nfiling.8\nThe record contains three court information sheets, which reflect that three\ncreditors obtained judgments against Applicant. The first court record indicates that a\nhospital obtained a judgment against Applicant on February 1, 2002 in the amount of\n\nItem 9. Under state law, the ability to enforce this judgment, if unpaid, expires in December 2008. State\n9\nCode\u00b6 16.1-69.55 B.3.\nItem 10. The time to collect this judgment, if unpaid, has expired. State Code\u00b6 16.1-69.55 B.3.\n10\nItem 13.\n11\nItem 4, supra note 1; Item 7, supra note 7.\n12\nItem 4, supra note 1; Item 11; Item 12.\n13\nItem 5, supra note 2 at 19-20; Item 6, supra note 6, at 4.\n14\nItem 4, supra note 1, at 2; Item 5, supra note 21-22.\n15\n4\n$218.61 plus prejudgment interest of $77.96 and interest from the date of judgment.9\nThe second court record indicates that a realty company obtained a judgment against\nApplicant in the amount of $519.59 on December 18, 1998.  The third court record\n10\nshows a judgment entered against Applicant on September 20, 1996 in the amount of\n$928.  The court records do not show that the judgments have been satisfied; however,\n11\nApplicant denies owing these debts, stating that he paid these debts or that the debt\nwas resolved by the court. The judgments are not listed as debts owed in his\nbankruptcy petition.  \n12\nThe record contains two court case information sheets showing that a hospital\nfiled two separate garnishment actions against Applicant on January 7, 1998 and April\n6, 1998. The record also shows that the garnishee (employer, bank or other entity\nholding assets of a judgment debtor) never filed an answer to the garnishment. The\ncourt held a separate hearing for each garnishment on March 30, 1998 and July 17,\n1998, respectively. The information sheet shows the result of the hearing as \u201cother\u201d in\nboth cases. The name of the garnishee is not listed and no amount for a garnishment is\nlisted. Applicant denies that his salary was garnished. Thus, I infer that the court never\nissued the garnishment.  \n13\nWhen Applicant completed his SF-86, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 23 a, which\nasks if he had ever been arrested and charged with a felony offense. In his explanation,\nhe indicated that he had been arrested for a felony offense and listed his July 1987\nfelony arrest as a Habitual Traffic Offender and indicated the amount of time he served\nin jail. He did not list his other felony arrests as a habitual traffic offender as he\nconsidered all his subsequent arrests to be related to his first arrest. Thus, he did not\nthink it was necessary to list these arrests.14\nConcerning his finances, the Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 27 a through\nd. This question requests information about bankruptcy, garnishment, repossessions,\nliens, and judgments for the last seven years. Applicant did not list the 2002 judgment.\nAll other judgments are more than seven years old and he filed bankruptcy months after\ncompleting his SF-86. In his response to the Amended SOR allegations, Applicant\nstated that the judgment had been resolved in the 90s.15\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n16\nAppeals  Appeal Board, which under its decisional law does not review a case de novo. See ISCR Case No.\n07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). The Supreme Court\nin United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667.m 690 (198) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 (1974), the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d And, in United States v. First City\nNational Bank, this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the court should make\nan independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . . . give any special weight to\nthe [prior] determination of\u201d the administrative agency.\n(internal footnotes omitted). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board criticized\nthe administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and then\ndecided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations and\nultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes witness\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n16\n\ncredibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11(App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008).\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and\n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a\ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and\nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.\nBetween October 1986, when Applicant was 19 years old, and August 1988, the\npolice arrested him four times for misdemeanor offenses related to check writing and\nfailure to return rental property, twice for felony check fraud, once for felony perjury, and\nonce for habitual traffic offender, a felony. Between 1990 and 1993, the police arrested\nApplicant three more times as a habitual traffic offender, a felony. His felony arrests\n\n7\nresulted in convictions and sentences totaling 14 years. He served about three years in\njail. The disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 31 (a), (c) and (f) apply. The government\nestablished its case.  \nAG 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement; and,\n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be\nmitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries\nof the Military Departments or designee; or the Directors of Washington\nHeadquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),\nNational Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver.\nApplicant\u2019s check writing crimes occurred between October 1986 and April 1987,\nwhen he was 19 years old. He has not written a bad check in over 20 years. His felony\nconvictions related primarily to noncriminal traffic offenses, failure to pay traffic fines,\nand driving on a suspended license. Applicant finally learned to follow the rules of the\nroad. He has a valid driver\u2019s license and has not been arrested for any traffic offenses in\nmore than 15 years. He is married and a father. He works regularly and manages his\nfinances. He paid his traffic fines and the court lifted his designation as a habitual traffic\noffender in 1995. His criminal conduct occurred many years ago and the record\ncontains evidence of successful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) may be applicable.\nHowever, because he has several old felony convictions for traffic offenses and perjury\nwhen he was young, AG \u00b6 32 (e) prohibits mitigation of criminal conduct unless the\nDirector of DOHA grants a waiver based on meritorious circumstances. Guideline J is\nfound against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n17\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86 when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 27 b about his financial record and failed to list all his felony\narrests when he answered Question 23. This information is material to the evaluation of\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. He denies,\nhowever, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these questions. When a\nfalsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.\nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\n17\nomission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nAt the time he completed his SF-86, Applicant thought he had paid all the\njudgments against him in the 1990s. He listed no outstanding judgments as debts owed\nin his bankruptcy petition. He did not intentionally falsify his answer to Question 27 b.\nConcerning his felony criminal arrests, Applicant acknowledged in his SF-86 that he had\na felony arrest and had been sentenced to five years in jail. With this answer, he put the\ngovernment on notice that he had a felony criminal conviction and had served time in\njail. He had two arrests and convictions for perjury in 1988 and 1990, which raises a\nserious question about his honesty in the past. The issue now is whether his\nexplanation for failing to list all his felony arrests is truthful given his past perjury\nconvictions. His perjury convictions are 18 years old. He has not been charged with\nperjury or any other crime which raises questions about his honesty in 18 years. All his\narrests as a habitual offender related to traffic offenses, not crimes related to honesty.\nHe viewed his subsequent arrests as a habitual traffic offender and his perjury as a\ncontinuation of the first arrest for this offense. Given that he changed his life, his\nconduct and his youthful attitude and became a law-abiding member of society, I find\nthat he did not intentionally falsify the SF-86. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\n9\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that he pays his bills as agreed,\nmeaning timely and in the amount due. The old judgments are not listed on his credit\nreports. Because judgments are enforceable for ten years in the jurisdiction where the\njudgments were obtained and Applicant lives, see State Code 16.1-69.55 B.3., I\nconclude that the 1998 judgment would still be listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports if\nunpaid for two more months. Outside of these two small judgments, which Applicant\nresolved, he has no history of not paying his debts and bills. Instead, his credit reports\nreflect the opposite.  \nThe court does not directly collect the money due and owing as a result of a\njudgment; rather the judgment creditor must collect the debt and can do so through a\nvariety of legal mechanisms, including garnishment. If the debtor pays the judgment\ncreditor directly, then the judgment creditor is responsible for notifying the court that the\njudgment has been satisfied. In the instant case, Applicant denied owing the judgments\nlisted in Amended SOR allegations 3.b, 3.c and 3.f stating that the debts are paid. In\nlight of his denial of these allegations, the burden of proof shifts to the government to\nestablish that the debts are owed. The court case information sheet is not sufficient\nevidence to establish that Applicant has not paid these debts. As discussed above, the\njudgment creditor may not have filed a line of satisfaction with the court once the debt\nwas paid. If this is the case, the court records would still consider the debt unpaid. In\naddition, Applicant did not include these judgments in his bankruptcy, which I find is an\nindication the debts are paid. His credit reports reflect a very good payment history on\nhis bills, another indicator he has been truthful about paying these debts. The record\nevidence establishes only that a creditor filed a garnishment action on two separate\noccasions in 1998, not that the court issued the garnishment and Applicant\u2019s salary was\ngarnished, particularly since the garnishee did not file an answer and is not identified.\nThe government has not established its case as to allegations 3.b through 3.f. As for the\nbankruptcy, Applicant does not deny he filed for bankruptcy protection. He did not seek\nprotection because of unpaid bills, but because someone else defaulted on a note he\ncosigned. He pays his bills as shown by the credit reports.  Thus, the government has\nnot established a security concern as he lives within his means and manages his\nfinancial obligations. The allegations under Guideline F are found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\n\n10\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When he\nwas 19 years old, the police arrested and charged Applicant with misdemeanor and\nfelony larceny and bad checks several times in less than a year. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) He\nhas not been arrested, charged or convicted for the crimes related to bad checks since\n1987. Prior to July 1987, Applicant\u2019s driving resulted in fines, arrests and suspension of\nhis license. Despite the suspension of his driver\u2019s license, Applicant continued to drive.\nThis conduct resulted in his habitual traffic offender arrests and confinement in jail.\nSince his last incarceration, Applicant has undergone significant behavioral changes. He\nfinally matured. He understood the negative consequences of his conduct and changed\nhis attitude and behavior. He complies with the state motor vehicle laws. He has not\nbeen arrested for any traffic violation in 15 years or criminal conduct in 18 years. He\nserved his time in jail and paid the court fines imposed by the court. Since his last\nrelease from jail, he follows the rules of society. He works and supports his family. He\npays his bills on a regular basis and has not accumulated excessive, unpaid debts. He\nand his wife filed for bankruptcy seven months ago, not because of excessive unpaid\ndebt, but because he co-signed a loan for an individual who has now defaulted and the\ncreditor is seeking payment from him. He is married and has three children. As a result,\nhe has focused his attention on providing a stable domestic environment for his family.\nHis bankruptcy filing cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the\nissue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. His\nfinances are insufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nAlthough not violent crimes, his youthful crimes involving perjury and bad checks,\nwhich pertain to honesty, an important character issue in a security clearance\ndetermination. In the last 15 years, Applicant has conformed with the general rules of\nsociety and is to be commended for his change in behavior. In his discussions with the\ninvestigator, he provided all the information about his youthful conduct and the\npunishment imposed on him. He has been truthful about his finances. His conduct in the\n\n11\nlast 15 years reflects a real change in him. I would grant Applicant a clearance given the\nchanges he has made in the last 15 years; however, under Guideline J AG \u00b6 32(e), his\nfelony convictions preclude him from holding a clearance unless a waiver is granted.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and\npersonal conduct, but not his criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 29, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 3, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 12, 2008, and requested \na hearing before an Administrative Judge.

GE 1, Tr, 85-86. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his e-QIP, credit reports, Response to Written \nInterrogatories, and several state and federal tax lien records. GE 1 \u2013 8. \n\n \n3\n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified nine separate line items, which consist of three \nfederal tax liens totaling $40,507, and six state tax liens totaling $12,424, for a \ngrand total of $52,931. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.i. Applicant stated he did file his tax \nreturns, but did not have the money to pay his taxes. Tr. 49. \n \nApplicant encountered financial problems as a result of a costly divorce in \n1997. Being short of cash, he increased the number of his deductions to have \nmore available cash. He explained: \n \nBecause at the time I had just [gone] through a divorce and I was \nhaving financial problems and I was trying to get as much money \nthere because I was living on my own, had my own apartment. First \ntime I ever lived on my own.

I realized it was \nwrong and I\u2019ve since then, I\u2019ve changed back to zero where it was \nsupposed to have been. Tr. 41. \n \nTo resolve his debt with the IRS and state tax liens, Applicant retained the \nservices of a nationally recognized tax resolution company in December 2007. \nThis company specializes in reaching settlements and/or assisting clients resolve \ntheir tax difficulties. This tax resolution company has yet to meet with respective \ntax officials. Applicant has been paying $420 every month to the IRS through \npayroll deduction from his full-time job since June 2006. Response to SOR, AE E, \nTr. 28, 32, 37-40, 50-51. Currently, Applicant is paying off his state tax debt \nthrough garnishment since early 2008, in which 25% ($159) is deducted bi-\nmonthly from his part-time pay check. Before his pay was garnished, he was \nmaking payments by money order. Response to SOR, Tr. 34. On June 10, 2008, \nhe took out a loan through his Thrift Savings Plan to pay off the remainder of his \nstate tax lien. AE F. To maintain these payments and get out from his tax debt, \nApplicant also took on his second job in July 2006.  Tr. 25. \n \nApplicant also is seeking financial counseling through his Employee \nAssistance Program (EAP), an employee benefit offered through his full-time \nemployer. Tr. 26-27, 43-44. \n \nApplicant provided two employer-related reference letters from his full-time \njob supervisors. Both of these individuals hold the rank of Sergeant. His \nsupervisors were uniform in their praise of Applicant. Included in their comments \nwere \u201c[Applicant] reports on duty each day on time,\u201d \u201cconducts his duties in a \nprofessional manner,\u201d \u201cexcellent role model for other employees,\u201d \u201cvery \ndependable,\u201d and has \u201cattributes demonstrat[ing] someone with an exceptional \ncharacter.\u201d AE D, AE G. \n \n\n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as \nto obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n5\n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern \nis that an Applicant\u2019s \n \n \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged he made some poor financial decisions. His \nproblems stem primarily from increasing the number of deductions while going \nthrough a divorce to increase the amount of his disposable income. When his \ntaxes became due, he did not have the money to pay them, and his problems \nwere compounded when penalties and interest were imposed. He is paying down \nhis tax liabilities through payroll deductions to the IRS and through garnishment to \nthe state tax officials. These payment arrangements were initiated before his SOR \nwas issued in February 2008. He also retained the services of a tax resolution \ncompany in December 2007 to guide him through this process, and he has sought \nbudget counseling through his Employee Assistance Program. In the interim, he \nremains current on his payments to the IRS and state tax officials. To further \ndemonstrate his resolve to pay his tax liabilities, he took on a part-time job in July \n2006 and more recently applied for a loan through his Thrift Savings Plan to pay \noff his state tax liabilities. Applicant demonstrated through his actions and \ndemeanor that he has the resolve and wherewithal to put his financial difficulties \nbehind him. \n \n \nHis reference letters are noteworthy. He is a reliable and conscientious \nemployee, where he is employed in two highly visible federal facilities. His \nsupervisors consider him trustworthy and value him as an employee. \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6\n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt \nor establish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial \nbreaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, \nhigh debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, \ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be \nexplained by subject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets \nor returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of \ngambling losses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay \ngambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by \ngambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \nlisted supra, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are applicable or partially \napplicable: \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Since 2006, \nApplicant has been actively repaying his state and federal tax obligations. It was also \nin 2006 that he obtained a part-time job so he could pay his past due taxes. This \nshows he is acting responsibly under the circumstances, has initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay, and the problem is being resolved. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his illegal drug use. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn January 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H, Drug \nInvolvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 25, 2008, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on February 28, 2008. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nApril 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on March 7, 2008. He responded on \nApril 3, 2008, and enclosed performance appraisals. I received the case assignment on \nApril 17, 2008. I have marked the performance appraisals as Exhibit (Ex.) A, and they \nare admitted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 5, 2007, Applicant admitted both \nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has a Bachelor \nof Science degree in engineering. He has been with his current employer since 2005, \nand his previous company from 2001 to 2005. He has never been married and has no \nchildren.1  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, from about 1994 through \nOctober 2007. He would smoke the marijuana on weekends at his home or with friends \nat their homes.2 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \ncertified as true on August 1, 2006. He listed his marijuana use from 1994 through \nFebruary 2006, and stated: \n \nMy use of controlled substances is exclusive to Cannibus (sic). I\u2019m willing \nto discuss this issue further if needed, in person. The take-away for you is \nthat it is more important for me to modify my personal, private lifestyle and \nserve my country, than not.3 \n \n \nApplicant continued to smoke marijuana after he submitted his SF 86. He \ndescribed his use of marijuana to a background investigator on February 5, 2007. He \ntold the investigator that he made an effort to try and stop smoking the marijuana after \nFebruary 2006, because he wanted a security clearance and wanted to be a law-\nabiding citizen, but he continued to smoke marijuana. He stated that he would continue \nto try and stop smoking marijuana, but he did not feel that the government had the right \nto make him stop, as his marijuana use was a personal choice and no one had the right \nto make that choice for him. He stated that he did not feel that he was dependent on the \ndrug. He claimed marijuana allowed him to become very focused without any negatives. \nHe expected to continue to smoke marijuana on the same basis as he had for the past \n12 years, which was occasionally and only on the weekends.4  \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; Items 4, 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n4 Item 5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after his background interview on February \n5, 2007. A statement was not provided but the interview was summarized in a Report of \nInvestigation (ROI). He was sent Interrogatories containing the ROI and was asked if \nthe ROI accurately reflected the information that he provided to the investigator. He \ncertified on October 25, 2007 that it did. He was provided an opportunity to add \nadditional information regarding the matters discussed during his interview and stated: \n \nHaving read the adjudicative guidelines within DoD Directive 5220.6, I now \nunderstand the government\u2019s position regarding drug involvement of \nsecurity clearance applicants. I understand that disclosure of my personal \nconsumption of cannabis may raise a security concern. In an effort to \nmitigate that concern, I submit herewith this signed statement of intent to \nimmediately cease possession and consumption of cannabis.5 \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM dated April 3, 2008, Applicant stated that in \nretrospect, he realized that his continued infrequent marijuana use between the time he \nsubmitted his SF 86 on August 1, 2006, and October 2007, was \u201can error in judgment.\u201d \nHe wrote that his continued use was \u201cthe result of substantial-work related pressure.\u201d \nApplicant described a hectic and stressful work environment in which he was managing \nthree major projects. He stated: \n \nFor over a year I have basically been in damage control mode. There are \nmore days than not that I leave work completely, mentally exhausted. The \njob I have results in significant personal stress. It has been my experience \nthat, when used sparingly and in balance, consumption of cannabis \nsignificantly attenuates the stresses I incur from performing my job.6 \n \nApplicant wrote \u201ca signed statement of intent [not to use illegal drugs] with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d He further stated that he no longer associates \nwith individuals who use drugs. He has taken up a musical instrument and takes music \nlessons and practices during his leisure time. Applicant submitted performance \nappraisals which indicated that he is a conscientious, dedicated, and valued employee.7  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n5Id. \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n7 Ex. B. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \n\n \n5 \n \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(b) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana possession8 and use are sufficient to raise the above \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana up until about October 2007. That is too \nrecent to be mitigated under AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant wrote in his response to \nInterrogatories on October 25, 2007, and again in his response to the FORM, \u201ca signed \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d He states \nhe has disassociated from his drug-using associates and contacts and avoids the \nenvironment where drugs are used. I find Applicant has done enough to raise AG \u00b6 \n26(b) as a factor in mitigation.  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8 Marijuana must be possessed in order to be used. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant used marijuana until \nOctober 2007, without regard for the law. He was 43 years old when he last smoked \nmarijuana. He continued to smoke marijuana after submitting his SF 86 in August 2006, \nand after his background interview in February 2007. I considered Applicant\u2019s positive \njob performance, the changes in his lifestyle, and his stated intent not to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. However, he has not established a long enough track record of living \ndrug-free to overcome the many years of drug use, poor judgment, and disregard for the \nlaw.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Conese, Personal Representative \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence), based on Applicant\u2019s ties to Hong Kong. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on March 2, 2006. On \nMarch 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 11, 2008; answered it on \nMarch 20, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on March 27, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nApril 21, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on April 29, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on April 30, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 21, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, presented \nthe testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was \nadmitted without objection. The record closed on May 21, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 5, 2008.  \n \nEvidentiary and Procedural Rulings \n \nAuthentication of a Report of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 2, DOHA interrogatories that included a \npersonal subject interview extracted from a report of investigation, without calling an \nauthenticating witness as required by the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the \nauthentication requirement to Applicant, and she waived it (Tr. 48-50). Accordingly, I \nadmitted GX 2 in its entirety.  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Hong Kong and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The request and its \nenclosures were not admitted in evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HX) I. I took administrative notice as requested by Department Counsel (Tr. 43). \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR and \noffered explanations. Her explanation regarding SOR \u00b6 1.d, that the person is no longer \na citizen of Hong Kong but is now a citizen and resident of the U.S., amounts to a \ndenial, and I have treated it as such. Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at \nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old native of Hong Kong. She, her mother, and her brother \nemigrated from Hong Kong to the U.S. in 1997, shortly before the transfer of Hong Kong \nfrom the United Kingdom to the PRC (Tr. 59-60). Her father remained in Hong Kong. \nApplicant was then about 13 years old (Tr. 60). She attended 8th grade, high school, \nand college in the U.S., receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in May 2006.   \n \nApplicant, her mother, and her brother became U.S. citizens in May 2003 (Tr. \n61). Applicant testified that she and her family members are dual citizens because they \nautomatically became PRC citizens when Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC in \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1997, with no action on their part (Tr. 65). She also testified she would be willing to \nrenounce her PRC citizenship if it were necessary (Tr. 59). \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was selected to participate in a three-year leadership \nprogram operated by a government contractor, in which she works a 40-hour week \nrotating across the various engineering disciplines and participates in an academic \nprogram leading to a master\u2019s degree. She testified her long-term goal is \u201cto become a \nleader\u201d for her employer (Tr. 82). She held an interim clearance for a short time, but she \nhas never held a permanent security clearance.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager testified she is technically very competent and very \nconscientious. She earned a \u201cresounding chorus\u201d of favorable comments from \nsupervisors and peers for her performance as a team player (Tr. 17-18). In a written \nstatement, he described her as \u201cdependable, reliable, hard-working, conscientious, and \nhonest in all her assignments and interactions with others.\u201d He also commented on her \n\u201cconstant loyalty and dedication.\u201d (AX A.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were divorced in 2003, and they have no contact with each \nother (Tr. 68-69). Both parents are financially self-sufficient. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother has never worked outside the home. She returned to Hong \nKong at some time after May 2003, because she did not speak English well and found it \ndifficult to interact with others (Tr. 84). Applicant traveled to Hong Kong during school \nbreaks in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2005, to visit her mother, and she stayed with \nher mother during these visits (Tr. 79). Her mother last visited her when she came to \nApplicant\u2019s graduation in 2006 (Tr. 71). She speaks with her mother about two to three \ntimes a month. \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had no contact with her father for about \nsix months. During her multiple visits to Hong Kong, she saw her father once (Tr. 79). \nShe has not been comfortable with her father since the divorce (Tr. 85). She became \nemotional when testifying about her father (Tr. 69), and she was reluctant to be specific \nabout the basis for their estrangement. She appears to blame him for the divorce (Tr. \n85). Her father is an electrician and a director of a small, privately-owned electrical \nconstruction company (Tr. 74-75). She knows he lives in Hong Kong, but she does not \nknow his current address (Tr. 67). She last saw her father about two years ago. He did \nnot attend her college graduation (Tr. 78).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother lives and works in the U.S. He is a consultant for an \ninformation technology company (Tr. 64). \n \nApplicant testified she does not talk to her family about her work, and they do not \nask about it (Tr. 57-58). None of her immediate family members are politically active or \nconnected to the government of Hong Kong or the PRC. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s college roommate was a citizen of Hong Kong, but is now a U.S. \ncitizen and resident (Tr. 58). After they graduated from college, they did not remain in \nclose contact. Their contact is now limited to an occasional email, perhaps once a \nmonth (Tr. 59). By contrast, Applicant testified she has developed very close \nrelationships with her 13 classmates in the leadership development program (Tr. 92). \nThe relationships go beyond work and school and include travel and social events (Tr. \n93). \n \n \nWhen Applicant first came to the U.S., she held a passport issued by the United \nKingdom. It expired in July 2005, and she now holds only a U.S. passport.  \n \n \nHong Kong has been a special administrative region of the PRC since July 1997. \nHong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, except in the areas of defense and \nforeign policy. While defense and foreign policy are a PRC responsibility, Hong Kong is \nan independent customs authority and economic entity separate from the PRC, with the \nauthority to make international agreements on its own behalf in commercial and \neconomic matters. Hong Kong has one of the world\u2019s most open and dynamic \neconomies. It remains a free and open society where human rights are respected, \ncourts are independent, and there is a well-established respect for the rule of law. \nHowever, residents are limited in the ability to change their government, and the \nlegislature is limited in its power to affect government policies. \n \n \nHong Kong is an active member of the global coalition against terrorism. It has \ncooperated in eliminating funding for terrorist networks and combating money \nlaundering, and it has enacted legislation designed to comply with the United Nations\u2019 \nanti-terror resolutions and financial task force recommendations.  \n \n \nDue to the substantial role of the PRC in the areas of defense and foreign policy, \nthe relationships between the PRC and the U.S. are relevant on Guideline B cases \narising from family and other connections with Hong Kong. The PRC has an \nauthoritarian government dominated by the Communist Party. It has large and \nincreasingly sophisticated military forces. The U.S. and the PRC have been rivals since \nthe Cold War, with particular disagreement on Taiwan.  Despite political disagreements, \nthe U.S. and the PRC have become major economic and trading partners. The PRC \naggressively targets sensitive and protected U.S. technology and military information, \nusing worldwide intelligence operations, including those in Hong Kong. It is one of the \nmost aggressive practitioners of industrial espionage. U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry \nare considered prime intelligence targets.   \n \n \nThe PRC has a poor human rights record. It suppresses political dissent, and it \npractices arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners. Travelers to the PRC can expect to be placed under surveillance, with their \nhotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines monitored and personal possessions, \nincluding computers, searched without their knowledge or consent. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe PRC considers persons of Chinese descent born in Hong King to be PRC \ncitizens. However, the PRC and the U.S. have agreed that all U.S. citizens entering \nHong Kong on U.S. passports will be considered as U.S. citizens by Hong Kong \nauthorities, even though such persons may be considered PRC citizens by PRC \nauthorities.  \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of Hong Kong and the U.S. \nand resides in Hong Kong (SOR \u00b6 1.a); her father is a citizen and resident of Hong \nKong (SOR \u00b6 1.b); her brother is a dual citizen of Hong Kong and resides in the U.S. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); her college roommate is a citizen of Hong Kong residing in the U.S. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d); and she traveled to Hong Kong in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2001, and 2005 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG & 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Nevertheless, the nature of \n\n \n7 \n \n \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The new guidelines recognize that the nature of the country \ninvolved is a factor that must be considered. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress \nis significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Under \nthe old guidelines, any risk of foreign influence was sufficient to raise a potentially \ndisqualifying condition. The new guidelines require a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The totality of an \napplicant\u2019s ties to a foreign country as well as each individual tie must be considered.  \nISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of the U.S. His dual citizenship is \nsolely the result of a unilateral decision by the PRC to declare that anyone born in Hong \nKong or the PRC is a citizen of the PRC, and it does not raise a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nforeign influence. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s present relationship with her former roommate, \nnow a U.S. citizen, does not raise a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign influence. However, the \nfacts that Applicant\u2019s mother resides in Hong Kong and her father is a PRC citizen \nresiding in Hong Kong are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(a). Applicant\u2019s travel to Hong Kong \nwas solely to visit her mother, and it has no independent security significance. See \nISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). Applicant is close to her mother. She is estranged from her father, but it was not \nclear from her testimony whether she still has any feelings of affection or obligation for \nhim. I conclude AG \u00b6 7(b) is raised. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s mother has never worked outside the home, has no \npolitical affiliations, and has no governmental connections. Her father is an electrician \nby trade and he runs a private electrical construction company. Like her mother, he has \nno governmental connections or political affiliations. Neither parent is involved in high-\ntechnology industries likely to engage in industrial espionage or be used as a conduit for \nindustrial espionage. The Hong Kong government, unlike the PRC, has a good human \nrights record and does not use abuse of its citizens as a means of military or industrial \nespionage. The Hong Kong government has strong economic and political connections \nwith the U.S., independent of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s only connections to Hong Kong, like \nher brother\u2019s, are through her parents. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is established for \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members.  \n \n \nThere is no information in the record about Applicant\u2019s former roommate\u2019s family \nties or background. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of establishing \nAG \u00b6 8(a) for her former roommate. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family \nmembers could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family \nmembers were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. The Appeal \nBoard consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that an applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a choice between \nthe interests of the family member and the interests of the U.S. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to \napply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk. Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty and obligation to her parents is certainly not minimal. \nHowever, her relationships and loyalties in the U.S. are strong. She left Hong Kong \nwhile it was still a British colony. She has no sense of loyalty or obligation to the current \ngovernment of Hong Kong or the PRC. She has lived in the U.S. since she was a child. \nShe was educated in the U.S. and has been a citizen for more than five years. She has \nformed strong bonds with her classmates in the leadership development program. Her \nmanager regards her as a conscientious, dedicated, and loyal team player. She aspires \nto be a leader in the U.S. In the unlikely event that she was required to resolve \nconflicting loyalties to her family or the interests of the U.S., I am satisfied she would \nresolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThere is no evidence indicating whether Applicant had a close relationship with her \nformer roommate when they were students, but it is clear that they now have only \noccasional and casual contact. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is established for her former \nroommate. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. She left Hong Kong \nwhen it was a British colony, and she has no attachment or sense of obligation to the \ncurrent government of Hong Kong or the PRC. She came to the U.S. as a child, and she \nhas matured into a talented, dedicated adult with strong ties to the U.S. She was \nselected for a highly competitive leadership development program. She has excelled in \nher academic pursuits and impressed her peers and supervisors with her interpersonal \nskills, loyalty, and dedication. She aspires to be an industry leader in the U.S. She is \ncircumspect about discussing sensitive information and does not discuss her work with \nher family. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude \nshe has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nOn March 19, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a determination \nbe made on the administrative record. Department Counsel timely converted the case to \na hearing before an administrative judge in accordance with \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request to convert Applicant\u2019s case to a hearing is marked as \nHearing Exhibit I. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 1, 2009. The case \nwas assigned to me on May 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was \nissued, scheduling the hearing for June 15, 2009. The case was heard on that date. The \nJuly 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \n\u2013 5. Applicant testified and offered 10 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A - J. The record was held open until June 30, 2009, to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted a one-page document which \nwas admitted as AE K. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE K is marked as Hearing \nExhibit II. The transcript (Tr) was received on July 13, 2009.  \n \nAfter the hearing, it was discovered a portion of the beginning of the hearing was \nnot properly transcribed. On July 9, 2009, I held a telephone conference with Applicant \nand Department Counsel. I explained the situation to both parties. I gave Applicant two \noptions. First, the hearing could be re-opened to cover the portion of the hearing that \nwas not properly transcribed. Second, the parties could enter into a Stipulation of \nTestimony which covered what transpired during the portion of the hearing that was not \ntranscribed based on the parties\u2019 handwritten notes. Applicant chose to enter into a \nStipulation of Testimony. I prepared a draft Stipulation of Testimony regarding what \noccurred during the first part of the hearing based on my notes. I provided Applicant and \nDepartment Counsel a copy of the draft Stipulation of Testimony on July 9, 2009. The \nparties were given until 16 July 2009 to provide comments pertaining to the Stipulation \nof Testimony. Based on the comments submitted, a final Stipulation of Testimony (4 \npages) was completed and signed by the parties on July 22, 2009.  I received \nApplicant\u2019s signature page on July 28, 2009. The Stipulation of Testimony is marked as \nHearing Exhibit III. \n  \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e and \ndenies all of the remaining allegations in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old chief electronic technician employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor seeking to maintain his security clearance.  He has \nworked for the same company for over 33 years. He has held a security clearance since \n1975. In 1977, he married for the first time. He and his first wife separated in September \n1996. They divorced in 2002. He remarried on May 16, 2002. He and his second wife \nseparated in December 2008. He has three adult children and an adult step-daughter. \n(Tr at 7-8; Gov 1; Stipulation of Testimony)  \n \nOn April 10, 2007, Applicant completed a questionnaire for sensitive positions \n(SF 86) as part of his periodic update of his security clearance. (Gov 1) A subsequent \nbackground investigation revealed that Applicant had eight delinquent accounts. The \ndelinquent accounts included:  a $4,570 account placed for collection in August 2003 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 4, 9; Gov 5 at 3); a $2,297 account that was charged off in       \nMay 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 4, 8; Gov 5 at 2); an $868 delinquent account that was \nplaced for collection in April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 4 at 5; Gov 5 at 2); a $3,047 \n\n \n3 \n \n \njudgment entered against Applicant in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 5; Gov 5 at 1); a \n$4,405 department store account that was placed for collection in June 2004          \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 4 at 7, 8; Gov 5 at 2); a $2,933 credit card account that was placed for \ncollection in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 4 at 8); a $2,632 account that was placed for \ncollection in March 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 4 at 6; Gov 5 at 2); and a $50 medical \naccount that was placed for collection in April 2005. (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 5 at 1) \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant states he has been employed for over 33 \nyears. He claims the only debts he has is a car that he purchased in March 2005, and \nhis home which he has owned for over 28 years. He owes $10,000 on his mortgage and \nhas over $100,000 in equity. He disputes most of the debts in the SOR. He and his first \nwife separated in 1996. The divorce was final in 2002. His first wife died on June 30, \n2006. After her death, he began to get bills for accounts that he claims were not his. He \ndisputed these debts with the credit reporting agencies. If they are proven to be his \ndebts, he has no problems paying the accounts. He believes his first wife opened these \naccounts in his name without his knowledge. (Answer to SOR; Stipulation of Testimony; \nAE D \u2013 AE H) \n \nApplicant admits that he owes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e which is a $4,405 \ndepartment store account that was placed for collection. Applicant had entered into an \nagreement to settle the account for $2,100. He paid $100 a month towards this account \nfor seven months. He stopped the payments because he could never get anything in \nwriting from the company regarding the settlement agreement.  He doesn\u2019t believe he \nwas receiving credit for the money that he paid to the company.  He intends to pay the \naccount once the company explains what happened to the $700 that he already paid. \n(Tr at 4, 17; Gov 3 at 6, 12)  \n \nApplicant also admits that he owes the $50 medical account alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h.  He has not paid the bill because he does not know who to contact to pay the bill. \n(Tr at 5, 11) The SOR alleges a generic medical bill. No specific creditor is mentioned.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is found for Applicant due to the lack of specificity in the pleading.   \n \nApplicant claims that he has no open credit card accounts. He is not sure \nwhether his current wife opened credit card accounts with his name on the account as a \njoint creditor. (Tr at 6)  \n \nApplicant sent in formal disputes to the credit reporting agencies for the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. (AE A; AE B; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE H) \nIf the debts are discovered to be his responsibility he intends to pay them. He is capable \nof paying the debts. (Tr at 16) \n \nApplicant owes a federal income tax debt from tax year 2007. The tax debt was \nthe result of a misunderstanding between he and his wife. He thought they were going \nto file joint tax returns but his wife filed in the status of married, filing separately. \nApplicant owed more taxes as a result. The balance on the tax debt is $1,332.11. He \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhas been paying $100 a month to the Internal Revenue Service since January 2008. (Tr \nat 10, 12-15, AE J)    \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $3,000. He has approximately \n$1,000 left over after expenses. His expenses include: mortgage $679; truck payment \n$470; $200 utilities; cell phone $50; payment to IRS $100. (Tr at 9-11) \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance appraisal covering the period from October \n2007 to September 2008 indicates that he met or exceeded expectations. It was noted \nthat Applicant \u201cConsistently meets the requirements of the job in all respects.\u201d His \nappraiser commented that Applicant\u2019s performance was \u201cgreat\u201d over the past year. (AE \nC) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s credit reports listed eight \ndelinquent accounts, a total approximate balance of $20,829, which implies Applicant \nhas a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant \ndisputes the majority of these accounts. He claims that his first wife opened these \naccounts without his knowledge. Applicant has held a security clearance for over 33 \nyears and these financial issues appear to contradict his track record of financial \nresponsibility. He does not live beyond his means and has $100,000 in equity in his \nhome. He has taken steps to formally dispute the debts and intends to pay the debts if \nthey are proven to be his accounts. Considering the circumstances, the delinquent \naccounts do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment.   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant disputes most of \nthe debts, claiming his ex-wife opened these accounts without his knowledge.  Applicant \nis separated from his current wife. Although he is not sure his current wife opened any \ncredit card accounts, it is a possibility. Applicant has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances by disputing the delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agencies. \nHowever, this mitigating condition is given less weight because although Applicant paid \n$700 towards the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e which he admits is his debt, he stopped \npayment on the account in August 2008 and the status of the account is unresolved.  \nHowever, the majority of the delinquent debt appears to have occurred as a result of \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control and Applicant has taken responsible steps \ntowards resolving the accounts. \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant credibly testified that he did not \nopen the majority of the delinquent accounts. He has taken steps to resolve the \nsituation by disputing the accounts with the credit reporting agencies. If it is determined \nthat the debts are his, he has the money to pay the debts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) applies. Applicant believes that his first wife opened credit card accounts in his \nname which he did not discover until after her death in 2006. He began to receive \ndelinquency notices after her death. He disputed the debts with the credit reporting \nagencies but is still waiting for the result. His financial situation is stable and if the debts \nare proven to be his responsibility, he has the means to resolve the accounts.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 33-year \nemployment history as well as his 33 years of holding a security clearance. Applicant \nformally disputed the accounts and will pay the accounts if it is determined they are his \nresponsibility.  He lives within his means and is capable of paying any of the debts if it is \ndetermined they are his responsibility. Applicant met his burden to mitigate the concerns \nraised under financial considerations. However, he should remain proactive in resolving \nthese accounts in order to avoid financial concerns in the future with regard to his \nsecurity clearance.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

As a first offender,\nApplicant was ordered to undergo a substance abuse screening and assessment and perform\ncommunity service.  Applicant completed his probation, and the charge was dismissed.  On his\nsecurity clearance application, Applicant indicated that he was motived to use marijuana in August\n2006 by an upsetting incident in his neighborhood in May 2006.  However, he listed the dates of his\nmarijuana use as January 2001 to the present.  On his application, Applicant also admitted using the\nprescription drug Adderall without a prescription, obtaining it from a friend who had a prescription.\nApplicant stated on his application that he used Adderall from January 2006 to the present, but he\ntestified that he did not use it while he was on probation for the marijuana offense.  Applicant was\n\u201cvague and somewhat evasive\u201d in his testimony regarding Adderall.  Decision at 3.  The Judge stated\nthat Applicant\u2019s testimony \u201cwas not credible or reasonable\u201d . . . and that \u201che often gave different\nresponses to the same question.\u201d   Id. \nApplicant contends that he was denied due process.  Specifically, he maintains that he did\nnot understand his burden of proof and was misled by the Judge as to that burden.  He argues that\nif he had properly understood his burden of proof, he would not have waived the 15-day notice\nrequirement and would have spent more time preparing for the hearing.  Applicant\u2019s argument is not\npersuasive.\nApplicant represented himself at the hearing.  Although pro se applicants cannot be expected\nto act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the\nDirective; if they fail to take such steps, that failure does not constitute denial of their rights.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-24460 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2008).  A review of the record shows that\nApplicant received a copy of the Directive, and in response to a question by the Judge, indicated that\nhe had read at least a portion of it.  Transcript at 49.  Paragraph E3.1.15 of the Directive states that\n\u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  Moreover, at the\n\n3\nbeginning of the hearing, the Judge made the following statement to Applicant: \u201cThe government\ntoday has the obligation to prove by substantial evidence any contested facts.  However, they have\nno such obligation as to any facts to which you have already admitted.\u201d  Transcript at 5.  It was\nshortly after that explanation that the Judge asked Applicant if he waived the 15-day notice rule.\nApplicant stated that he had waived it.  Transcript at 7.  Applicant had knowledge of the burden of\nproof before he stated that he waived the 15-day notice.  If Applicant needed more time to prepare,\nhe could have requested it.  Since he did not make the request, he cannot now claim error.  Applicant\nhas not shown that he was denied due process.\nApplicant also argues that the Judge did not properly apply the whole-person concept to the\nfacts in Applicant\u2019s case.  In her decision, the Judge listed factors set forth in the Directive (at \u00b6\nE2.2(a)) as relevant to a whole-person analysis.  Throughout her decision, the Judge applied those\nfactors to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Applicant contends that the evidence he provided should have led\nthe Judge to reach a favorable security clearance based on the whole-person concept.  In making his\nargument, Applicant weighs the record evidence differently than the Judge and reaches different\nconclusions.  His ability to do so is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge did not apply the\nwhole-person concept properly, or weighed the evidence in a way that was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-33312 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2005).  The Judge has\na duty to make findings and conclusions that reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record\nevidence as a whole and adequately take into account an applicant\u2019s overall conduct and\ncircumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-06194 (App. Bd. Jul. 15, 2004).  The Judge\u2019s findings\nand conclusions in this case reflect an interpretation of the record evidence that is consistent with\nthe whole-person concept.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 22, 2008. He requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on February 21,\n2008, and I received the case assignment on the same day. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on February 21, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 5,\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nApplicant waived his right to 15 days notice.\n1\nDepartment Counsel offered three documents for administrative notice concerning the Controlled\n2\nSubstance II Adderall. I accepted the documents at the hearing.\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated June 2007 ).\n3\nId.\n4\nTr. 38-39.\n5\nTr. 15; 39.\n6\n2\n2008.  The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were received without\n1\nobjection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, without\n2\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 13, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received January 25, 2008, Applicant admitted some\nof the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. He denied all other\nallegations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility\nfor a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1986, and he received his undergraduate degree in 1996.  He is not\n3\nmarried. He has been with his current employer since October 1992.4\nApplicant used marijuana while he was in high school. He would smoke with his\nfriends on the weekends. After graduation from high school, Applicant continued using\nmarijuana occasionally in college.5\nApplicant lived with his grandmother from the age of 16. He returned to live with\nher after graduating from college. She died in 1997 and he inherited the house. He\nadmitted that he used marijuana in 1998 because he was on his own and had the\nopportunity to do so.6\nIn August 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of\nmarijuana. At the time, he was attending a concert with a friend. Applicant had his own\npipe at the time. He was sitting in a car preparing to smoke from a pipe that belonged to\nhis friend. Applicant placed the pipe under the seat when the police arrived. When\nquestioned by the police, he initially denied that he had been in possession of the pipe.\nHe eventually admitted to the officer that the pipe belonged to him. He went to court for\nthe charge as a first offender. The judge ordered Applicant to undergo a substance\nabuse screening and assessment and to perform 24 hours of community service.\n\nTr. 26; AE A.\n7\nTr. 20.\n8\nTr. 18.\n9\nGE 2 (Interrogatories, dated October 2007).\n10\n3\nApplicant completed his probation which ended on January 28, 2008. The charge was\ndismissed.7\nApplicant completed his security clearance application in June 2007. When\nApplicant responded to section 24 (use of illegal drugs and drug activity), he explained\nin detail that his 2006 use of marijuana was motivated by an incident that occurred in\nMay 2006 in his neighborhood. He recounted that he witnessed a shooting two doors\ndown from his home and watched the man die. However, he listed the dates of use for\nmarijuana from January 2001 to the present.\nIn response to section 24 (use of illegal drugs and drug activity), he also noted he\nused the prescription drug Adderall. Adderall is a Schedule 2 Controlled Substance. He\nnoted that he had a friend who used the prescription medication and that he wanted to\nsee what it does for your attention. He listed the dates of use as January 2006 to the\npresent (June 2007). His answer to the SOR lists the same dates.\nAt the hearing, Applicant contradicted that information. He stated the dates were\na mistake because he did not use Adderall when he was on probation. He could not\nanswer when he actually started or stopped using the prescription medication. He was\nvague and somewhat evasive in his testimony regarding his reason for trying his friend\u2019s\nprescription medication. He testified that at first he did not realize it was an\namphetamine, but he continued to use it for a while in tablet form. He took the\nprescription when he had a lot of work to do because he could work eighteen hours\neasily.  He also stated that turning 40 was a difficult thing for him and that this behavior\n8\nwas an aberration on his part.  \n9\nThe Department of Defense interviewed Applicant in 2007 as part of his security\nclearance investigation. His answers to questions concerning his use of marijuana differ\nfrom his responses to the SOR and his testimony at the hearing. However, he confirmed\nthe information was correct when he signed the Interrogatories.  Applicant states that\n10\nhe has no dependency on marijuana. At one point, Applicant testified that his pipe had\nresin from 1998 when the police arrested him in 2006. Although, at the hearing he\nadmitted carrying a pipe, he denied any other use from 1998. His testimony was not\ncredible or reasonable. When Applicant was cross examined during the hearing he\noften gave different responses to the same question.  \n\nTr. 50.\n11\nAE B (Packet of Recommendations).\n12\n4\nApplicant stated that he has never been in any other trouble in his life. He does\nnot believe this will happen again. He acknowledged that he did not realize the\nseriousness of taking prescription medication without a prescription.  \n11\nApplicant\u2019s current employer praises his outstanding work. He has several letters\nof recommendation from 1992 to the present.12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Applicant acknowledged using\nmarijuana sporadically for a period of time in high school, college and again in 2006. He\nalso admitted using Adderall without a prescription for a period of time as recent as\n2007. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nUnder AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is\nalso potentially disqualifying. In 2006, Applicant was arrested for possession of\nmarijuana with drug paraphernalia. He had his own pipe. He completed probation in\nJanuary 2008. The charge was then dismissed. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26 (a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nillegal use arose when he was in high school and college. However, he recently used\nmarijuana in 2006. He completed his probation only a month ago. I do not find that this\nmitigating condition applies.  \n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 26 (b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation. As noted above, some of the problems arose\nfrom Applicant\u2019s immaturity. However, Applicant was almost 40 years old when he used\nthe marijuana at the concert and decided to use his friend\u2019s prescription drug - Adderall.\nHe has not had an appropriate period of abstinence for mitigation. In addition, his\ninconsistencies do not convince me of his future intentions concerning the illegal drug\nuse.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\ncommunity standing.\nApplicant\u2019s inconsistency in his answers to questions concerning marijuana use\nand the time period during which he used Adderall leaves me with doubts about his\nreliability and judgment. He was unable to answer questions in a clear, straightforward\nmanner. I find his personal conduct creates a vulnerability and raises a security concern\nunder the above disqualifying condition. After reviewing the mitigating conditions, I do\nnot find that any apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\n\n7\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a high school student. He is now 40 years old and employed with a\ndefense contractor. Although the marijuana use is limited in scope, Applicant\u2019s 2006\nincident with marijuana and his various inconsistent statements in his security clearance\napplication, his answers to the SOR and his testimony at the hearing do not convince\nme that his poor judgment is not likely to recur. His poor judgment to use Adderall for a\nperiod of time because he was approaching 40 is troubling. Applicant has not met his\nburden of proof in this case. His testimony was at times not credible, especially in light\nof the statement concerning resin in his pipe from 1998.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old single woman from Brazil, who emigrated to the United States in 1992. She attended both college and graduate school in the U.S., earning degrees in business administration and computer science, respectively. She became a naturalized citizen in 1999. Her mother and sister are also naturalized U.S. citizens. All reside in the U.S. For the past four years, Applicant has worked as a computer manager tasked with installing educational software onto hard drives located on a military base (Tr. 12). Both her supervisors and her clients are pleased with the quality of her work (Tr. 23). At the time Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, she worked for a company that required her to travel to Brazil on short notice (Tr. 14). Because she could travel there quicker with a Brazilian passport than with a U.S. one, Applicant applied for, and received a Brazilian passport (Answer). Since leaving this job in 2004, she has retained and renewed her Brazilian passport. She needs it to expedite her travel to Brazil in case of a family emergency. When Applicant\u2019s Brazilian passport expires in 1 2009, she plans on renewing it (Tr. 19). Applicant has no Brazilian property or public welfare interests.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2008, and requested a hearing. I was\nassigned the case on April 29, 2008. On May 6, 2008, the hearing was scheduled for\nMay 7, 2008. At the hearing, I received three government exhibits and the testimony of\ntwo Applicant witnesses. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 11, 2008. Upon\nreviewing the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s application for eligibility to\nhold a security clearance is denied.\nJune 30, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s father and grandparents are Brazilian citizens and residents. Some of her grandparents have experienced\n1\nserious health problems over the years (Tr. 15).\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old single woman from Brazil, who emigrated to the United\nStates in 1992. She attended both college and graduate school in the U.S., earning\ndegrees in business administration and computer science, respectively. She became a\nnaturalized citizen in 1999. Her mother and sister are also naturalized U.S. citizens. All\nreside in the U.S.\nFor the past four years, Applicant has worked as a computer manager tasked\nwith installing educational software onto hard drives located on a military base (Tr. 12).\nBoth her supervisors and her clients are pleased with the quality of her work (Tr. 23).\nAt the time Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, she worked for a\ncompany that required her to travel to Brazil on short notice (Tr. 14). Because she could\ntravel there quicker with a Brazilian passport than with a U.S. one, Applicant applied for,\nand received a Brazilian passport (Answer). Since leaving this job in 2004, she has\nretained and renewed her Brazilian passport. She needs it to expedite her travel to\nBrazil in case of a family emergency.  When Applicant\u2019s Brazilian passport expires in\n1\n2009, she plans on renewing it (Tr. 19). \nApplicant has no Brazilian property or public welfare interests. She has not voted\nin a Brazilian election since emigrating to the U.S.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n3\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States\u201d (AG \u00b6 9). Here,\nApplicant\u2019s possession of a Brazilian passport triggers the application of AG \u00b6 10(a),\n\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\u201d\nAbsent any foreign influence security concerns, the fact that Applicant traveled to\nBrazil on several occasions over the years, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e, does\nnot generate a security risk. I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThere is no record evidence of any enmity between the Brazilian and U.S.\ngovernments, nor any record evidence that the Brazilian government engages in\nespionage against the U.S. Since emigrating to the U.S., Applicant has assimilated into\nU.S. society, earning two advanced degrees, and becoming engaged to a U.S. citizen\nwho is a member of the armed services.\nThe possession of a foreign passport, alone, is significant enough, however, to\ngenerate a security risk, because it raises the possibility that its holder may engage in\nforeign travel that the U.S. would not be able to verify. Applicant maintains the Brazilian\npassport solely in the event she needed to travel there quickly during a family\nemergency. The negative security significance of possessing a foreign passport \u201cis not\nnegated or diminished because an applicant engages in these acts for personal reasons\nor for personal convenience\u201d (ISCR Case No. 99-0424(App. Bd. (February 8, 2001)). \nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\nhas not mitigated the foreign preference security concern.\n\n4\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the whole person factors in the Foreign Preference section of the\nDecision, above. Upon considering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions\ntogether with the whole person factors, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is\ndenied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",
