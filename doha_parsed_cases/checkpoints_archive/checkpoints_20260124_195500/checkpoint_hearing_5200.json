Cohen, Esquire\nMay 1, 2008\n______________\nRemand Decision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 30,\n2004. On April 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 25, 2007, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on June 29, 2007.  A motion to join both the Applicant\u2019s hearing and her\nhusband\u2019s hearing was considered and granted, based upon a showing of good cause.\n(See, ISCR 06-07293, November 27, 2007).  A notice of hearing was issued on July 10,\n2007, scheduling the hearing for August 23, 2007.  At the hearing the Government\npresented one exhibit.  The Applicant presented four exhibits and called one witness,\nher husband.  She also testified on her own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on September 6, 2007.\n\n2\nThe initial decision in this matter was issued by the undersigned Administrative\nJudge on November 27, 2008, granting the Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  Department\nCounsel appealed the decision to the Appeal Board, and both Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel filed appeal briefs.  On April 16, 2008, the Appeal Board remanded\nthis case to the Administrative Judge for a new decision under Guideline B.  The Appeal\nBoard stated in a footnote that \u201cThe Judge\u2019s favorable finding under Guideline E is not\nchallenged on appeal\u201d.  (See ISCR Case No. 06-07192, at 2 (App. Bd. April 16, 2008).)\nTherefore, only Guideline B will be addressed in this remand decision.  The Appeal\nBoard noted that:\n\u201cThe Judge should issue a new decision which discusses the\napplication of  DC7(d) in light of the Judge\u2019s ultimate findings and\nconclusions with regard to Applicant\u2019s husband.\u201d  (See Id. at 3).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 57 years of age and has a Master of\nBusiness Administration degree.  She is Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of a\ndefense contracting company.   As an officer of the corporation it is required that she\nhave a clearance for the corporation to have a Facility Security Clearance.  She seeks a\nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant is a native born American citizen.  Her husband was a dual citizen\nof the United States and Israel.  He has now surrendered his Israeli passport and\nrenounced his Israeli citizenship.  (See Tr. 97).  The Applicant\u2019s husband has worked in\nthe defense industry for over thirty years, and has held a security clearance for many of\nthose years.  He is highly respected in the defense industry and has demonstrated\nloyalty and responsibility toward the United States.  He is President and Security Officer\nof the company for which the Applicant is employed.  There is no evidence in the record\nthat the relationship between the Applicant and her husband creates a heightened risk\nof foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.  (See Remand Decision 06-\n07293 (May 1, 2008).)   \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of\nIsrael.  The Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and the Applicant do not communicate well\ntogether.  Her mother-in-law does not speak English and the Applicant\u2019s Hebrew is very\nlimited so their communication is very difficult.  Her sister-in-law speaks English, but\nvery little.  Although the Applicant\u2019s husband speaks to his mother and sister in Israel on\na monthly basis, the Applicant, for the most part, is unable to communicate with them.    \n   \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Israel.\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the government and\n\n3\nexercises executive power.  According to the Department of State Report on Human\nRights, the Israeli government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but\nthere are some issues with respect to treatment of Palestinian detainees, conditions in\nsome detention and interrogation facilities, and discrimination against Israel\u2019s Arab\ncitizens.  Terrorist suicide bombings are a continued threat in Israel and the U. S.\nGovernment has received information indicating that American interests could be the\nfocus of terrorist attacks.  American citizens have been urged to exercise a high degree\nof caution and common sense when visiting restaurants, businesses, and other places\nassociated with U.S. interests and/or located near U.S. official buildings.  The theft of\nsensitive and proprietary information threatens the national security in both military and\neconomic terms, and it reveals the intelligence-gathering capabilities of foreign\ngovernments and foreign companies.  The National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000\nReport to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists\nIsrael as one of the active collectors of proprietary information.  Furthermore, Israeli\nmilitary Officers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in  the United\nStates.\n \nA letter of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant by the Senior\nRabbi at their synagogue indicates that he considers her to be a honest, trustworthy,\nupstanding and respectable member of society.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n7(a)  contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion; \n7(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which\nthese person are located, or the positions or activities of those person in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\n\n5\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in Foreign Influence that indicates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has foreign contacts in Israel (Guideline B).  This evidence can indicate poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and 7(d) sharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with\nforeign person, the country in which these person are located, or the positions or\n\n  The Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted \u201cApplicant\u2019s Brief to the Administrative Judge on Remand\u201d on April 30, 2008. \n1\nThis document has not been considered in making this decision.\n6\nactivities of those person in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S., and 8(c) Contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also apply.\nThe Applicant\u2019s husband is a United States citizen who has held a security\nclearance for many years, and who has an impeccable record demonstrating\nresponsibility, honesty and trustworthiness, toward the United States government and\nthe defense industry.  There is no evidence in the record indicating that the Applicant\u2019s\nrelationship with her husband would create a heightened risk of foreign inducement of\nany kind.        \nThe Applicant has little or no contact with her mother and sister-in-law in Israel.\nIn fact they don\u2019t even speak the same language.  Furthermore, her relatives in Israel\nare not affiliated in any way with the Israeli government, nor do they know or understand\nwhat the Applicant does for a living.  Sufficient mitigation has been shown.  Accordingly,\nI find for the Applicant under this guideline.  \nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case, I have also\nconsidered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The Applicant is 57 years of age and is the\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer for a defense contracting company.  She has\nenormous responsibilities within her company and on behalf of the United States.  She\nis a native born United States citizen who has four children all born in the United States\nwho reside here.  Her husband was, at one time, a dual citizen of Israel.  He has\nformally and forever renounced his dual citizenship with Israel and surrendered his\nIsraeli passport.  There is nothing in the record to question her loyalty or show that she\nwill not uphold and protect the national interests of the United States above all.\nFurthermore, there is no evidence in the record to conclude that the Applicant would\nsuccumb to any inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the government of\nIsrael or through her husband.  Considering all of the facts and circumstances, I find\nthat she has mitigated the concerns arising from her foreign influence.\n \nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline B Foreign Influence and Guideline E Personal\nConduct of the SOR. Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guidelines B and E.1\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence\nsupports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations\nexpressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The\nlikelihood or not of the hypothetical ever occurring may further affect the weight to be assigned. \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 12, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under  Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C\n(Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 27, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  There was no cross-\nappeal.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board remands the case to the Judge for the issuance of\na new decision.\nIn the Formal Findings section of her decision, the Judge found in favor of Applicant under\nGuideline B and SOR paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b), and against Applicant under Guideline C and SOR\nparagraphs 2(a) through 2(f).   However, a close reading of the text of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates\n1\njust the opposite\u2014that she actually found in favor of Applicant under Guideline C and against\nApplicant under Guideline B.  In the Conclusions section of her decision, the Judge listed the\napplicable Guideline C Disqualifying Conditions.  She then discussed the security implications of\nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship with Israel, his possession and use of an Israeli passport to visit his\nfamily members in Israel, and his subsequent renunciation of his Israeli citizenship and the surrender\nof his Israeli passport.  Afterwards the Judge stated: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, I find for\nthe Applicant under Guideline C (Foreign Preference).\u201d   The Judge then listed the applicable\n2\nGuideline B Disqualifying Conditions and discussed why Applicant\u2019s connection to his two family\nmembers in Israel created a potential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and his desire to help those individuals or their country.  Following that\nanalysis, the Judge then stated: \u201cAccordingly, Guideline B, Foreign Influence is found against\nApplicant.\u201d   \n3\nAs a threshold matter, the Board concludes that both parties misread the Judge\u2019s decision as\nfinding against Applicant under Guideline C and in favor of Applicant under Guideline B.  This was\napparently due in part to the discrepancy between the conclusions in the text of the Judge\u2019s decision\nand the Formal Findings.  It was also apparently due in part to the fact that the Judge relied\nextensively on Applicant\u2019s negative responses to a hypothetical question  as to his willing to bear\n4\n\nIn his brief, Applicant\u2019s counsel asserts that DOHA engages in the discriminatory practice of only questioning\n5\napplicants with family members in Israel as to whether they would bear arms for the U.S. against that country.\nApplicant\u2019s assertion in that regard without merit.  Applicants with family members in other countries are also asked that\nquestion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-02172 (A. J. May 16, 2003) (South Korea); ISCR Case No. 01-02204 (A. J. Sep.\n4, 2001) (Switzerland); ISCR Case No. 03-21111 (A. J. Bd. Jun. 7, 2006) (Afghanistan); ISCR Case No. 01-10189 (A.\nJ. Dec. 31, 2001 (United Kingdom); ISCR Case No. 00-0127 (A. J. Nov. 7, 2000) (Ireland); ISCR Case No. 03-04132\n(A. J. Mar. 29, 2004) (People\u2019s Republic of China); ISCR Case No. 02-01987 (A. J. Nov. 12, 2003) (Cuba); ISCR Case\nNo. 01-26993 (A. J.

Feb. 22, 2006).\nThis was evidence which the Judge could properly consider along with the other evidence of record in reaching\n6\nher decision.\nAs noted above, the Board concluded that Guideline C had been resolved in favor of Applicant.  Therefore,\n7\nthat Guideline is no longer at issue.\nIn conducting her analysis, the Judge should be cognizant of the Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. 03-21434\n8\nat 3-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007).\n3\narms for the U.S. against Israel  in her analysis of the security concerns presented by Applicant\u2019s\n5\nforeign family ties under Guideline B.   Applicant\u2019s responses in that regard had actually been\n6\nasserted as factual allegations under Guideline C.\nThe Board recognizes the presence of some ambiguity in this matter.  Therefore, in order to\nbe fair to the parties, the most expeditious resolution is to remand the case to the Judge for the\nissuance of a new decision.  In her new decision, the Judge\u2019s analysis should address all the relevant\ncircumstances relating to the Guideline B allegations,  including the current significance of\n7\nApplicant\u2019s foreign family ties, Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S., the circumstances under which\nApplicant has previously held a security clearance, the evidence as to Applicant\u2019s character, and the\nidentity of the country in accordance with Directive.8\nOrder\n \nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

The Applicant is 60 years of age and has a Ph.D in Engineering. He is President and Security Officer of a defense contracting company. As an officer of the corporation it is required for him to have a security clearance for the corporation to have a Facility Security Clearance. He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).

Cohen, Esquire\nMay 1, 2008\n______________\nRemand Decision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP), on March 10, 2006.  On April 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 22, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on June 29, 2007.  A motion to join both the Applicant\u2019s hearing and his\nwife\u2019s hearing was considered and granted, based upon a showing of good cause.\n(See, ISCR 06-07292, November 27, 2007).  Accordingly, a notice of hearing was\nissued on July 10, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 23, 2007.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented three exhibits.  The Applicant presented nine exhibits and called\none witness, his wife.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The Applicant submitted one\nPost-Hearing Exhibit consisting of two pages.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non September 6, 2007.\n\n2\nThe initial decision in this matter was issued by the undersigned Administrative\nJudge on November 27, 2007, denying the Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed the decision to the Appeal Board, and both Applicant and Department\nCounsel filed appeal briefs.  On April 16, 2008, the Appeal Board remanded this case to\nthe Administrative Judge for a new decision under Guideline B stating, \u201cthe Board\nconcluded that Guideline C had been resolved in favor of the Applicant.  Therefore that\nGuideline is no longer at issue.\u201d  (See ISCR case No. 06-07293 at 3, fn 7 (App. Bd. April\n16, 2008).)  Accordingly, only Guideline B will discussed in this Remand Decision.  The\nAppeal Board further noted that:\nIn her new decision, the Judge\u2019s analysis should address all relevant\ncircumstances relating to the Guideline B allegations, including the current\nsignificance of the Applicant\u2019s foreign family ties, Applicant\u2019s ties to the\nU.S., the circumstances under which the Applicant has previously held a\nsecurity clearance, the evidence at to Applicant\u2019s character, and the\nidentity of the country in accordance with Directive.  (Id. at 3 (footnote\nomitted).)\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 60 years of age and has a Ph.D in\nEngineering.  He is President and Security Officer of a defense contracting company.\nAs an officer of the corporation it is required for him to have a security clearance for the\ncorporation to have a Facility Security Clearance.  He seeks a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born and raised in Israel.  He moved to the United States in\n1973, for graduate school, and obtained his doctorate degree in Engineering in 1978.\nSince then, he has worked in the defense industry and has held a security clearance\nmuch of that time.  From 1978 to 1987, even before becoming a United States citizen,\nhe held a DoD security clearance.  (Tr. p. 123).  In 1987, he became a United States\ncitizen.  Sometime later, the Applicant formed his own company, where he has used his\nscientific, engineering and management experience, and has for the past sixteen years\nworked as a defense contractor.  His company employees 16 people and runs several\nmillions of dollars of research and development in support of DoD, with a significant\nportion in classified fields.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, D and E).\nThe Applicant\u2019s elderly mother is 85 years old and in poor health, and his sister,\nwho is his mother\u2019s caretaker, is 51 years old.  Both are citizens of and reside in Israel.\nHis mother has always been a housewife, and his sister works part time selling\ntupperware and dietary supplements.  She lives with the Applicant\u2019s mother is an\napartment that they own, worth approximately $90,000.  Neither of them have any\n\n3\ntechnical education or are affiliated with the Israeli government in any way.  The\nApplicant contacts his mother or sister at least once a month or so.  When Applicant has\nan occasion to speak to his mother or sister, they discuss his mother\u2019s health.  (Tr.\np.71).  Since coming to the United States, he has traveled to Israel every two to three\nyears to visit his mother.  The Applicant provides no financial support to his mother or\nsister of any kind.  His mother is a Holocaust Survivor who is supported by the lifetime\ncompensation she receives from Germany and social security from her deceased\nhusband. \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife and four children were born and reside in the United States.\nHe has many extended family members from his wife\u2019s side that reside in the United\nStates.  His net worth in the United States in approximately $5,000,000.  He has no\nassets of any kind in Israel.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  \nNumerous character references that include his past supervisor, professional\ncolleagues in the defense industry, and his rabbi, all attest to the Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment.  They highly recommend the Applicant for a\nsecurity clearance.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit  G).\nThe Applicant has made many significant technical contributions to the United\nStates security and defense industry over the past 30 years.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E,\ntabs 1 through 10).   He has also received many awards, commendations and special\nrecognition for his major contributions to the defense industry.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nG).\nI have considered the relationship that does exist between the United States and\nIsrael.  The fact that Israeli tourists may enter the United States without a visa, the large\nfinancial assistance the United States provides to Israel, and the treaties between the\nUnited States and Israel, specifically bi-lateral agreements involving defense,\ncommerce, atomic energy, aviation, energy, mutual security, and terrorism.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit H).\n  \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Israel.\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy whose prime minister heads the government and\nexercises executive power.  According to the Department of State Report on Human\nRights, the Israeli government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but\nthere are some issues with respect to treatment of Palestinian detainees, conditions in\nsome detention and interrogation facilities, and discrimination against Israel\u2019s Arab\ncitizens.  Terrorist suicide bombings are a continued threat in Israel and the U. S.\nGovernment has received information indicating that American interests could be the\nfocus of terrorist attacks.  American citizens have been urged to exercise a high degree\nof caution and common sense when visiting restaurants, businesses, and other places\nassociated with U.S. interests and/or located near U.S. official buildings.  The theft of\nsensitive and proprietary information threatens the national security in both military and\neconomic terms, and it reveals the intelligence-gathering capabilities of foreign\ngovernments and foreign companies.  The National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000\nReport to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage lists\nIsrael as one of the active collectors of proprietary information.  Furthermore, Israeli\n\n4\nmilitary Officers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in  the United\nStates.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which\nthese person are located, or the positions or activities of those person in that country\nare such that it is unlikely  the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\n\n5\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\n\n6\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign\nconnections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises\nlegitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the\ninterests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government\nmust be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nThe Applicant by reason of birth, was at one time, an Israeli citizen.  However, he\nhas lived in the United States since 1973, obtained an advanced education, became a\nrespected United States citizen, and made the United States his permanent home.  He\nhas a wife and four children who were all born in the United States and reside here.  He\nhas a net worth of approximately $5,000,000 in the United States and no assets in\nIsrael.  He has worked in the defense industry for over 30 years, held a security\nclearance for many of those years, and has incurred no security violations.  He is highly\nrespected in his field and has made major contributions to the United States security\nand defense program.  The Applicant has so much invested in the United States that\nthe possibility that he could succumb to foreign influence of any type is extremely\nminimal.  \nThe Applicant has only two family members in Israel that include his elderly\nmother and caretaker sister.  He has limited conversation with them that revolve around\nhis mother\u2019s health.  Neither his mother or sister have any association with the Israeli\ngovernment.  Although they know that the Applicant owns a company that is somehow\naffiliated with defense, they are not capable of understanding what the Applicant does\nfor the Defense Department, nor do they know that the Applicant has applied for a\nsecurity clearance.  The Applicant has no assets in Israel and does not stand to inherit\nany.  Furthermore, Israel is a close ally of the United States.  \n\n  The Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted \u201cApplicant\u2019s Brief to the Administrative Judge on Remand\u201d on April 30, 2008. \n1\nThis document has not been considered in making this decision.  \n7\nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\nMitigating Condition 8(c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation also applies.\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case, I have also\nconsidered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The Appellant is 60 years of age and is the\nPresident and Security Officer of a defense contracting company.  He has worked in the\ndefense industry and held a DoD security clearance for a considerable period of time.\nHe has an impeccable record demonstrating the utmost respect, responsibility, honesty\nand trustworthiness toward the United States government.  Under the particular facts of\nthis case, I find that he has mitigated the concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence\nand Guideline C, Foreign Preference.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines\nB and C.      \n1\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n2.a.: For the Applicant\n2.b.: For the Applicant\n2.c.: For the Applicant\n2.d.: For the Applicant\n2.e.: For the Applicant\n2.f.: For the Applicant\n2.g.: For the Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

He\nhas a history of not meeting his financial obligations. He has six outstanding debts totaling\napproximately $32,304 and $29,736 of that amount represents child support. Applicant proffered\nevidence that he has been paying on this child support debt for the past eight years. He continues to\nowe $2,568 for five other outstanding delinquent debts. Applicant has not mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application, signed September 17, 2004).\n1\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer, dated August 10, 2006).\n2\nThe Government submitted six items in support of the allegations in the SOR.\n3\n3\nREMAND STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 17, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and completed a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86).  On June 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR\ndetailed reasons under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a document  sworn to on August 10, 2006 and\nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel\n2\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on October 18, 2006. A complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file\n3\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He had 30 days to respond\nto the FORM and chose not to respond. The case was assigned to me on December 1, 2006.\nOn January 31, 2007, I issued a decision denying Applicant a clearance. I concluded\nApplicant had not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. On February 15, 2007,\nApplicant filed a notice of appeal with the Appeal Board. The Chief Department Counsel declined\nto brief the issue or contest Applicant\u2019s appeal. On July 25, 20007, the Appeal Board remanded the\ncase for a new decision, which takes into account Applicant\u2019s submission in response to the FORM.\nIn the Appeal Board\u2019s decision, the Board indicated that the original file before me, on which I based\nmy decision, contained Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, dated November 17, 2006, which was\nforwarded to Department Counsel on November 21, 2006.\nREMAND FINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s submission in response to the FORM, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 52-year-old machinist who has worked for a defense contractor since June\n2004. He attended college in September 1976 and was awarded a degree in February 1978. Applicant\nis married. He divorced his first wife in 1979. The record is devoid of the number of children in his\nfamily. He did not list his children on his SF 86.\n\nIn his undated response to the FORM, Applicant listed four debts. However, the debts for Fashion Bug and\n4\nCitifinancial were not mentioned in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s Appeal, with attachments.\n5\n4\nA May 8, 2006, credit bureau report, which serves as a basis for allegations in the SOR,\nindicated that Applicant has six delinquent debts, totaling approximately $32,304. The debts at issue\nare these:\n\u00b61.a/DirectTV/Nationwide ($86)  This account has been placed for collection. As\nof May 8, 2006, this debt has not been paid. In his response to the FORM, Applicant\ndid not specifically address this debt but indicated he owed $201.00 for a delinquent\ntelevision bill. In his note on November 17, 2006, explaining his finances, he\nindicated that the television bill was \u201cunpaid,\u201d the amount owed is \u201c$201.00,\u201d and\nthe explanation \u201c[w]ill be paid by 01/06/07.\u201d In his note with his appeal in March\n2007, regarding an explanation of his finances, he lists a debt for a delinquent\ntelevision account. The status is \u201cunpaid,\u201d amount owed is \u201c$201.00,\u201d explanation\n\u201c[w]ill be paid as soon as possible.\u201d  \n4\n\u00b6 1.b/DirectTV/RSKMGMTNAN ($86) This account has been placed for\ncollection. As of May 8, 2006, this debt has not been paid. See \u00b6 1.a above.\n\u00b6 1.c/Child Support Enforcement ($29,736)  This debt is for delinquent child\nsupport. Question 34 of his SF 86 stated (Your Financial Record - Wage\nGarnishments  In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished for any\nreason). He answered \u201cyes\u201d and noted that in 1998 his paycheck was garnished for\nchild support. Applicant indicated that the balance on this account is now\n$27,346.87. He stated that \u201cthis account was set up and collected $50.00 every week\nfor the past 6 years after remaining dormant/settled for 3 years.\u201d \u201cFor the past two\nyears, $65.00 per week has been paid on this balance. (Nonstop, uninterrupted\npayments have been made for the past 8 years total.)\u201d5\n\u00b6 1.d/Medical creditor ($970) This account has been placed for collection. As of\nMay 8, 2006, this debt has not been paid. Applicant did not address this debt when\nhe submitted his response to the FORM.\n\u00b6 1.e/Medical creditor ($1,000) This account has been placed for collection.

Applicant did not address this debt when\nhe submitted his response to the FORM.\n\u00b6 1.f/Medical creditor ($426) This account has been placed for collection. As of\nMay 8, 2006, this debt has not been paid. Applicant did not address this debt when\nhe submitted his response to the FORM.\nApplicant has offered proof that he has been paying on his child support debt for the past few\nyears. At the time the SOR was filed, the child support debt was listed as being $29,736, but has\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n6\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\nDepartment of the Navy v.

In addition, Applicant has $2,568 in unpaid delinquent debts for five other\naccounts, as indicated in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst the policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n6\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n7\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n8\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n9\ndecision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n11\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n12\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n13\n\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n14\n6\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n14\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nUnder Guideline F, a security concern exists for an individual who is financially overextended.\nThe person is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial\nobligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be unconcerned,\nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. Applicant has a\nhistory of financial problems. He has an outstanding debt for child support that had been $29,736 but\nhas been reduced to $27,347. Although he has been paying on this debt for the past eight years, there\nwas a period of time when it was dormant and he is attempting to rectify that situation. Although he\nhas been paying on the child support debt, it shows that he has been financially irresponsible in the\npast in handling this debt. Moreover, there are five other delinquent debts listed on Applicant\u2019s credit\nreport totaling approximately $2,568. He had made no movement toward paying them off. Thus,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 1 (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) and FC DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply.\nVarious conditions can mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Applicant\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish mitigating circumstances. In his response to the\nFORM, he noted that a debt for $201 for a delinquent television account would be paid by January\n2007. However, in March 2007, he sent updated information with his appeal and indicated that this\nsame debt would be paid as soon as possible. Payment of a debt in the future is not a good faith effort\nto pay a debt. Applicant has not provided any evidence regarding why these five debts are still\ndelinquent. Moreover, in his submission in March 2007, he failed to provide information on three\nmedical debts totaling $2,396 that were listed in the SOR. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) 3 (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), FC MC 4 (the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control),\nand FC MC 6 (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) do not apply.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nis financially irresponsible when it comes to paying his debts. He is to be commended for diligently\npaying child support for the past eight years. However, he has five other debts that have not been paid.\nMoreover, Applicant failed to explain why his financial situation is preventing him from paying these\ndelinquent debts. In balancing all the information of record, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\n\n7\nthe security concerns arising from his financial difficulties. Based on the evidence of record, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-06338 at 3 (Sep. 7, 2004).\nApplicant identifies other errors, such as Applicant\u2019s age and years of service in the Air Force.

Applicant states, and Department\n1\nCounsel acknowledges, that Applicant began using JPAS in August 2004, and Applicant therefore\ndemonstrated that the period of violation was shorter.  The Judge also mischaracterized computer\nuse under JPAS, apparently believing that JPAS could only be accessed on one computer, which\nApplicant moved into his office in July 2005.  Decision at 3.  Although these are factual errors, they\nare harmless errors when viewed in the context of the record as a whole.   It is not likely that the\n2\nJudge would have reached a different decision if he had found that Applicant\u2019s security violations\nbegan four months later or that JPAS was accessible from more than one computer. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29,\n43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate , or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The\nJudge considered Applicant\u2019s testimony in that regard and reasonably concluded that Applicant had\nnot met his burden of proof.  Although Applicant argues that he was unaware until July 2005 of the\nrequirement that his assistant have a security clearance in order to access JPAS, the record supports\nthe conclusion that Applicant received and opened an e-mail message containing that information\nin March 2004 and was therefore on notice as to the requirement.  The Judge pointed to Applicant\u2019s\nyears of security experience.  While Applicant states that he did not receive training on the JPAS\nprogram, he had a responsibility as the FSO for his office to familiarize himself with at least the\nbasic concepts of JPAS.  The fact that he was given a user name and password for JPAS access\nshould have caused Applicant, as FSO, to realize that JPAS was more restricted than prior systems.\nSince access to the information was limited, an experienced FSO should not have shared the\ninformation itself with an uncleared employee, at least without confirming that he was allowed to\ndo so.  Moreover, as an experienced FSO, Applicant should not have allowed another employee\naccess to his user name and password.  Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is overly harsh\nbecause he did not compromise classified information.  As an FSO, he should have been aware that\nnot only classified information, but also sensitive personal information, must be protected.  Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E2.34(a) and (g). \n\n4\nThe Judge discussed why disqualifying conditions under both Guideline K and Guideline E\napplied to Applicant\u2019s conduct and why the conduct was not mitigated under the Guidelines or a\nwhole-person analysis.  The Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable based on record evidence.  Applicant\u2019s\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence and his disagreement with the Judge\nregarding the significance of Applicant\u2019s handling of protected information do not indicate error on\nthe part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08806 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2007).  The Judge\u2019s\ndecision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBrent Harvey, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 63 years old, a retired military officer, and now has 10 years experience as a\ncorporate officer.  Applicant has 40 years experience working with classified and sensitive\ninformation.  He allowed his assistant without a Secret security clearance to have access to the JPAS\nsystem for 18 months, contrary to JPAS regulations, Government advisory letters, and clear guidance\nfrom his corporate security officer.  Applicant failed to mitigate the handling of protected\ninformation and personal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On June 29, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected\nInformation) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on  December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 29, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on October 25, 2007.  On November\n14, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant\nsubmitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nNovember 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 63 years old, married, and has adult children.  He served 30 years in the U.S. Air\nForce, retiring in the grade of Colonel.  After retirement, he started work for a defense contractor as\nthe office manager of its local office, and now as a Vice-President of the company.  He also acts as\nits local facility security officer (FSO), and had that duty for 10 years.  He spends about 10% of his\nbusiness day on FSO duties. (Tr. 69, 70, 87, 90; Exhibits 1, A-C)\nApplicant has a reputation as being trustworthy and honest.  His character statements by\ncolleagues and friends show that they consider him as a man of integrity, professionalism, sound\njudgment, and competency.  Applicant had many years of experience in the Air Force with classified\nprograms, security programs, and handling classified information. (Tr. 122-145; Exhibits A-C)\nApplicant hired another retired officer in 2001 to assist him in his FSO duties.  That person\napplied for a security clearance, but was denied in March 2003.  Applicant testified at a hearing as\na character witness for that person, and wrote a letter in November 2002, on behalf of that person.\nThat person has reapplied for a security clearance, and his application is pending with the\nGovernment.  Applicant retained that person in his office and on the company payroll in a part-time\nposition.  That person had access to information in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS)\nin its original paper document configuration, and then from 2004 to 2005 on the computer-based\nsystem.  Only persons with a security clearance are permitted to have access to JPAS. (Tr. 52-54, 84,\n92, 96, 97, 109, 111, 115, 117, 118, 120; Exhibits 5-11)\n\n3\nThe JPAS system became the system of record for contractors in the Department of Defense\non October 1, 2004.  The Industrial Security Letter of July 15, 2004, explained the new requirements\nfor access to JPAS by FSO personnel and anyone else authorized access.  A Secret clearance or an\n\u201celigibility\u201d determination based on a favorably adjudicated investigation is now required for access\nto JPAS.  The information in JPAS is not classified, but privacy protected.   FSO\u2019s have a higher\nlevel of access for their duties than other persons.  JPAS training sessions were listed on-line for\nenrollment purposes by a government agency.  Contractors were made responsible for getting their\nemployees trained on JPAS.  The JPAS system is a DoD computer system, subject to the Privacy Act\nof 1974.  The system is also subject to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual\n(NISPOM), paragraph 2-200b, and the written procedures from the Defense Security Service (DSS)\ndated April 2007. (Exhibits 8-13)\nApplicant\u2019s company got access to JPAS in April 2004.  The corporate security officer in its\nheadquarters gave all company FSO\u2019s, including Applicant, a user name and password in a telephone\ncall made to each person in March 2004.  That official received the user names and passwords from\nthe DSS.  Applicant was personally responsible under his company\u2019s policy for JPAS at his work\nlocation. Applicant was notified in a memorandum dated March 12, 2004, from company\nheadquarters that his uncleared assistant could not have access to JPAS.  On July 15, 2005, that\nuncleared employee sent an email to the company\u2019s corporate security officer complimenting a\ncompany employee for her help in getting him  operational on the JPAS system, to which he was not\nauthorized access.  On July 27, 2005, that officer notified DSS that Applicant allowed the uncleared\nemployee assistant access to JPAS, even though he did not have a Secret security clearance, by\nallowing the employee to access JPAS through Applicant\u2019s account.  Applicant gave the employee\nhis user name and password.  The employee also assisted Applicant in the periodic changes of\nApplicant\u2019s password.  In July 2005, Applicant changed his procedures by moving the JPAS\ncomputer into his office and denying his assistant access to the computer, but continued to give him\ninformation from the JPAS system in paper print-out format. Applicant told a Government\ninvestigator in April 2006, that he was unaware that JPAS regulations required an appropriate\nsecurity clearance to have access to JPAS. (Tr. 22-45, 47-62, 72-77, 92-97; Exhibits 2-4, 14)\nApplicant claims he did recall receiving the Industrial Security Letters, NISPOM procedures,\nand the emailed memorandum of March 12, 2004, from his company\u2019s corporate security office, or\nreading them.  He knew he received them periodically.  Applicant had access to his email system and\nthe record on that system shows he opened the email.  DSS sent the Industrial Security Letters by\nmail to each FSO and later electronically notified each FSO that the letters were available on line\nfor reading.  Applicant was aware that JPAS was being implemented in 2004.  His office got access\nin August 2004.  After a meeting in September 2005 with a senior industrial security specialist from\nDSS about the uncleared employee having JPAS access, Applicant changed his password so the\nemployee did not have it.  Applicant did not comprehend any difference in the prior paper-based\nsystem and the new JPAS system, so he did not think there was any problem with allowing his\nuncleared subordinate access to the JPAS through Applicant\u2019s account. (Tr. 47-57, 74-84, 98, 101-\n107, 113; Exhibits 2-4, 8-13)\nApplicant received local training on JPAS, and did not use the government training programs.\nNor did he attend any company-sponsored training programs.  The corporate security officer and his\nassistant attended such a program in 2004. (Tr. 24, 81, 112; Exhibits 8-13) \n\n4\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\n\n5\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline K: The Concern: Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual's\ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or unwillingness and ability to safeguard such information,\nand is a serious security concern. \u00b6 33\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \u00b6 15\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline K: Applicant denied the allegation under this Guideline.  However, Applicant had\n30 years experience in the Air Force working on classified programs and complying with security\nregulations.  He had 10 years of private sector experience as the FSO for his work location.\nApplicant knew the JPAS was being implemented in 2004, and received a new user name and\npassword by his corporate security officer in March 2004.  The corporate security officer\u2019s senior\nsecurity coordinator on March 12, 2004, told Applicant his designated assistant was not a cleared\nperson, and consequently, could not have access to JPAS.  \nYet, Applicant continued to allow that assistant access to the JPAS system between March\n2004 and June 2005.  Applicant gave the employee his user name and password, allowed him to\nenter the JPAS system using the passwords, and perform functions on JPAS that the employee,\nwithout a Secret clearance, was not authorized to do.  That situation directly contravened the\nrequirements of the JPAS accessibility system. \n Applicant knew the employee did not have a Secret clearance because he wrote a character\nletter for him in 2002, and testified for him at his security clearance hearing in 2003.  Applicant\nknew the employee was denied a security clearance in March 2003.  \n\n6\nBased on 40 years experience in government security requirements, Applicant knew or\nshould have known of the new JPAS accessibility requirements.  Even after being told his assistant\ncould not have access to JPAS, Applicant ignored that advice and the requirements set forth in the\nIndustrial Security Letters, and other written documents discussing JPAS.  \nThe applicable Disqualifying Conditions (DC) are \u00b6 34 (a) (deliberate or negligent disclosure\nof classified or other protected information to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to\npersonal or business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at seminars, meetings, or\nconferences), and \u00b6 34 (g) (any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other\nsensitive information).\nI considered were all three Mitigating Conditions (MC) under \u00b6 35.  Two years has elapsed\nsince the last violation in September 2005, but the duration of the violations, from March 2004 to\nSeptember 2005, outweigh that passage of time.  The violations did not happen infrequently, but\nrather daily or weekly for that 18 month period.  There were no unusual circumstances involved,\nbecause Applicant knew he was acting contrary to the JPAS requirements.  Applicant as the local\nmanager could have designated another person who had a Secret clearance to be his assistant.  While\nthe situation is now unlikely to recur, the sequence of events, when compared to Applicant\u2019s\nexperience in this area, casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment\nbecause he persisted in his conduct after being told not to designate the uncleared person as his\nassistant.  Therefore, MC \u00b6 35 (a) does not apply.  While Applicant has a positive attitude toward\nhis security responsibilities, he was not a beginner in security compliance, but was the manager and\nFSO.  He refused to comply with JPAS requirements even after being told in March 2004, that he\nwas acting incorrectly.  MC \u00b6 35 (b) does not apply.  Lastly, \u00b6 35 (c) does not apply because training\nwas available, and as a manager he had the duty to obtain it.  Applicant has 40 years experience in\ncompliance with security requirements.  He is not a new and inexperienced employee, and had a duty\nto comply with JPAS requirements from the start of the program.\n \nGuideline E: Applicant denied these allegations under this guideline.  While he told the\nGovernment investigator he was unaware of the JPAS security clearance requirements when the\nsystem became operational, Applicant received an email inquiry and notification on March 12, 2004,\nfrom his company\u2019s senior security coordinator that his assistant had no security clearance and could\nnot have access to JPAS.  Applicant was on notice from March 2004 onward that his assistant was\nnot cleared for access to JPAS, but apparently chose to ignore it.  \nTwo DC under this Guideline apply: \u00b6 16 (c) (credible adverse information in several\nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not safeguard protected\ninformation); and, \u00b6 16 (d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when\ncombined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation.  This includes but is not limited to consideration of (1) untrustworthy or unreliable\nbehavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized\n\n7\nrelease of sensitive corporate or other protected information; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations).  Applicant knew for 18 months he should not have allowed his assistant to have access\nto JPAS, but persisted in that conduct.  When his company superiors discovered the violation, they\nreported it, and finally Applicant took corrective action to change his password in September 2005\nafter meeting with a Government industrial security representative.\nExamining and considering the MC under this guideline, none of the subsections under \u00b6 17\napply.  Applicant was confronted with the facts and then took action, so \u00b6 17(a) does not apply.  \u00b617\n(b, d-g) are not applicable on the facts.  \u00b6 17 (c) might apply if the situation were minor, but\nApplicant allowed a major violation of JPAS requirements for 18 months, knowing that his assistant\nwas not qualified to have access, and only changed the process after being confronted with the facts\nand the regulations.  \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nOf those factors, \u00b6 2 (1-5, 7-9) apply to the facts.  Applicant is an experienced military and\ncorporate officer with decades of security training and experience.  He was told in March 2004 his\ndesignation of an uncleared assistant for access to JPAS was wrong, but he persisted.  He failed to\neducate himself more thoroughly if he had any questions about the accessability requirements.  His\nconduct persisted for 18 months until Government officials and corporate officials confronted him.\nHe voluntarily allowed his assistant access, in part because he trusted him, hired him into the\ncompany, and found his work satisfactory.  The problem was that the assistant had been denied a\nsecurity clearance in March 2003, and Applicant knew of that denial.  Applicant found it convenient\nto have his assistant do the JPAS work because of Applicant\u2019s other corporate duties required much\nof his time.  Under such circumstances, Applicant should have hired or assigned another assistant,\nor relinquished the FSO duties.  There is a potential for coercion in the future based on this pattern\nof conduct, and a likelihood of recurrence because of Applicant\u2019s prior lack of attention to the JPAS\nrequirements.\nTherefore, I conclude the Handling of Protected Information security concern against\nApplicant.  I conclude the Personal Conduct security concern against Applicant.  Finally, I conclude\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

As\nof the date of his hearing, he had four accounts, owing approximately $5,000 that have been\ndelinquent for many years. His financial problems were, to a limited extent, the result of\ncircumstances beyond his control. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show he\nhas a track record of financial responsibility. More importantly, he deliberately falsified his security\nclearance application. Clearance is denied. \n\n  GE 1 (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated September 21, 2005.\n1\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n2\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended.\n  GE 2 (Credit bureau report (CBR), dated October 2005, and GE 6 (CBR, dated March 2007).\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 21, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  On June 12,\n1\n2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available\nto the Government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information and\nrecommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a security determination.  On\n2\nJune 29, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007. On March 29, 2007, I convened a hearing\nat which the government presented one witness and six exhibits, marked GE 1-6, to support the\nSOR. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented six exhibits, marked AE 1-6, which were\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all SOR allegations with explanations. His explanations are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old information technology technician. He attended college and\nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 5) He has no military service. Applicant\nhas never been married and disclosed no children. He has worked for his current employer, a defense\ncontractor, since June 2004, and requires access to classified information to retain his job.\nIn his September 2005 security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to\nquestions 28a and 28b, and failed to list any debts over 180 days delinquent he had during the last\nseven years, or any current debts over 90 days delinquent (respectively). The subsequent background\ninvestigation revealed he had four outstanding delinquent accounts which have been alleged in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b61.a - 1.d. \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted he acquired the alleged debts and that they are\noutstanding. Applicant testified he is not legally responsible for the alleged debts and does not intend\nto pay off the debts. SOR \u00b61.a concerns a $4,329 debt currently in collection by a collection agency\nfor a credit card account Applicant opened around June 2001. After Applicant became delinquent,\nthe credit card company charged off the debt and sold it to the collection agency around June 2002.3\nApplicant testified the credit card was sent to him by mail, unsolicited, and that he has no obligation\n\n  AE 5.\n4\n  GE 2.\n5\n  GE 3 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November 22, 2005).\n6\n4\nto pay the debt because he did not sign a contract with the credit card company. He claimed he asked\nthe credit card company twice to take the card back and they told him to keep it. He used the card\nwhen he was unemployed to pay for day to day living expenses. He averred he only charged\napproximately $1,500. (Tr. 40, 66) Applicant claimed he made some payments on the account, but\nhe was unemployed/underemployed, and his lack of earnings prevented him from making any more\npayments. In 2002, the credit card company went out of business. He has refused to recognize the\ncollection agency as the credit holder of the debt. He refused to make payments to the collection\nagency, because his contract was with the credit card company. He presented evidence showing the\ncredit card company went out of business in 2002.  \n4\nSOR \u00b61.b concerns a $360 suit (approximately value) Applicant purchased on credit in\nOctober 2002. He made some payments, but ultimately defaulted on the account. He claimed he\nattempted to contact the seller several times to make payments, but was not able to pay/contact the\nseller who had gone out of business (bankrupt). The seller charged off $174 in October 2003, and\nthe account was sold to a collection agency. Applicant has refused to pay the collection agency\nbecause his business was with the seller, not with the collection agency.\nSOR \u00b61.c concerns a $443 collection for a wireless phone service account. Applicant opened\nthe account sometime in 2004.  He entered into a dispute with the company concerning repairs to\n5\nhis cell phone, and the length of his service contract. The company refused to acknowledge that he\nonly had a one year service contract, and he refused to pay the debt. AE 6 (an invoice from the same\nwireless provider, dated March 22, 2007), shows Applicant has a current account with the provider\nand is making regular payments. \nSOR \u00b61.d concerns a $112 collection for another wireless account. Applicant testified the\n$112 was for roaming charges he refused to pay. When he entered into the wireless service contract,\nhe was told he would not be billed for roaming charges. After a month\u2019s use, he received a statement\ncollecting roaming charges and he refused to pay them. He claimed he paid other valid charges in\nthe account, but disputed the roaming charges with the provider. He presented no evidence, other\nthan his testimony, to substantiate his claims. \nOn November 22, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a government-contracted investigator\nas part of his background investigation. He was confronted with the four debts alleged in the SOR,\nand asked about his intentions with respect to the four delinquent debs. He stated he had no intention\nto pay off the debts.  \n6\nAt his hearing, Applicant testified he is not legally responsible for the alleged debts and does\nnot intend to pay off the debts. Concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1b, he explained that the original\ncreditors are out of business and he has no contract with the collection agencies. He is disputing the\ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1d, and as such, he stated he is not going to pay them. Additionally,\nhe averred that all four debts are more than seven years old. As such, he believes the debts are not\nlegally enforceable under the state\u2019s statute of limitations, and should have been dropped off from\n\n  Tr. 72-75, 83.  See AE 2, AE 3, and AE 4 for an explanation of Applicant\u2019s financial theory.\n7\n  Directive \u00b6 6.3. Each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\n8\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure\n2.\n  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201c. . . The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as\n9\nthe whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of the nature\nand seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the age of the\napplicant; the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or\nundertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and the probability\nthat the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \n5\nhis CBRs. Applicant further claimed that he resolved (discharged) the alleged debts by filing a UCC\nFinancing Statement in July 12, 2006. At his hearing, Applicant presented a convoluted financial\ntheory (UCC/Redemption Process), under which Applicant claimed he has able to discharge his\ndebts by filing a UCC Financial Statement and offering his personal credit to offset the debts.7\nApplicant testified, and the evidence shows, that he is current in all of his other financial\nobligations. Since taking his current job in June 2004, Applicant has had a monthly remainder of\napproximately $1,000 after paying his debts and living expenses. He claimed that his financial\nproblems were the result of periods of unemployment. The evidence shows he was unemployed from\n1993 to 1995, from January to July 2000, and from April to May 2004. While unemployed, he did\nnot have enough income to support himself and to pay for his delinquent debts. From 1998 to the\npresent he has worked as a mathematics teacher, program coordinator, sales representative, substitute\nteacher, and IT technician. \nApplicant testified he did not intend to falsify his security clearance application. He believed\nthat, because he was not legally obligated to pay the debts, he was not required to disclose them. He\nconsiders himself to be reliable, trustworthy, and with good judgment. In support of his assertions,\nhe submitted 33 character reference letters from supervisors, co-workers, and friends. Applicant is\ncharacterized as a hard-working person, with exceptional on-duty performance, excellent technical\nknowledge, and outstanding work ethics. In general, his references attest to Applicant\u2019s honesty,\ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and dependability. There is no evidence Applicant has mishandled,\nor caused the compromise of classified information while employed by a defense contractor.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence\nor absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the whole person concept.\n8\n9\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial\n\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n10\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n11\nthan a preponderance of the evidence.); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531.\n12\n  See, id.; Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n13\n6\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the applicable relevant adjudicative\nguidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n10\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it\n11\nis not clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels\n12\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of protecting national security.13\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to around\n2001. He accumulated approximately $5,000 in four debts resulting from periods of unemployment\nand the use of his credit to pay for day to day living expenses. As of the day of the hearing, he still\nhad the same four delinquent/charged off debts, owing approximately $5,000. Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1: A history of not meeting financial obligations;\nand FC DC 3: Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, apply in this case. \nAppellant established mitigating factors that I have considered as circumstances beyond his\ncontrol contributing to his inability to pay his debts -- i.e., his three periods of unemployment.\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 3: The conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), applies, but only to a limited\nextent. The evidence also shows that since 2001, Applicant ignored his delinquent debts and took\nlittle or no action to pay or resolve his debts. Since June 2004, he has had means to pay but refused\nto do so. Accordingly, his indebtedness, since at least when he was hired for his current job, has not\nbeen beyond his control at all.\nI specifically considered FC MC 6: The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and conclude it does not apply. Applicant\u2019s\nuncorroborated claims of contacts with creditors to make/attempt payments and to dispute his\nfinancial obligations are not sufficient to trigger the applicability of this mitigating condition. \nApplicant claimed his financial obligations are old and not legally enforceable (because of\nthe passing of the statute of limitations), that the debts should have been removed from his CBRs\nafter seven years, and that he resolved the debts by filing a UCC Financial Statement. His arguments\nare not persuasive. On balance, and after careful consideration of all information, Applicant\u2019s\nevidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his financial obligations. Applicant\npresented little or no evidence to show he paid debts, established or sought settlements/negotiations,\nestablished payment plans, budgets, sought financial assistance/counseling before or after receipt of\nthe SOR. Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that he has\nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s age, education, and work experience, his claim that he believed he\ncould resolve/discharge his financial obligations by filing a UCC Financial Statement is preposterous\nand disingenuous. He solicited credit and obtained goods and services based on his promise to repay\nhis financial obligations. Unable to repay his financial obligations, a reasonable, responsible person\nwould have used legally recognized means available to all United States citizens to revolve his credit\nproblems, i.e., settlements, negotiations, payment plans, and filing for bankruptcy protection. Instead,\nhe chose to disregard his financial obligations and waited for the passing of the statute of limitations.\nNotwithstanding the circumstances beyond his control, Applicant demonstrated a lack in\njudgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial affairs. He failed to present sufficient\nevidence to demonstrate good faith efforts to resolve his debts, or of the reasons that prevented him\nfrom discharging his financial obligations. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\n\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.\n14\n8\nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate\nquestion \u2013 whether a person\u2019s past conduct instills confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified information. An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.14\nThe government established, and Applicant admitted, that he failed to disclose the debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d in his response to questions 28a and 28b of his security clearance\napplication.\nConsidering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant deliberately failed to disclose\nhis delinquent debts. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including:\nApplicant\u2019s age, his level of education, his employment history, his demeanor and testimony, the\nnumber and value of the debts, his long term disregard of the debts, and the submission of his\nunrealistic financial theory to justify his behavior. I also considered the same reasons previously\noutlined under the Guideline F discussion, incorporated herein. Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\napplies.\nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions and concluded that none\napply. The evidence available in this case is not sufficient to support the applicability of any of the\nmitigating conditions. Although the falsification occurred in 2005, considering the totality of the\ncircumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, the passage of time alone is not sufficient to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by his behavior. The falsification occurred on the same security clearance\napplication that is now under adjudication. Additionally, for the same reasons outlined above under\nthe discussion of Guidelines F, incorporated herein, I conclude Applicant\u2019s behavior shows\nquestionable judgment, lack of reliability, and untrustworthiness. Guideline E is decided against\nApplicant.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the whole person\nconcept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s maturity, his years of good performance working for\na defense contractor, and his good reputation. Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances,\nApplicant demonstrated a lack in judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial\naffairs. He failed to provide credible information to justify or mitigate his unwillingness to satisfy\nhis delinquent debts. Moreover, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to mitigate the\noverall judgment, honesty, and trustworthiness security concerns raised by his falsifications.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are\nas follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct (Guideline E)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nJuan J.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 13,\n2004. On October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines E and\nD for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 9, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 19, 2007, and requested that his case be adjudicated\nwithout a hearing. DOHA received that request on October 24, 2007. In subsequent\ncommunication with a DOHA Department Counsel, via telephone and electronic mail on\nDecember 14, 2007, Applicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 23, 2008, and the case was\nFebruary 29, 2008\n\n2\nassigned to me on January 25, 2008. On January 31, 2008, Applicant waived his right\nto receive written notice 15 days in advance of the hearing in order to accommodate his\ntravel schedule and his desire for prompt resolution of his case. DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on February 1, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February\n7, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted exhibits (AE) A\nthrough E, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel also offered a\nstipulation between the parties agreeing that GE 1 through 4 were admissible, that was\nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. On February 8 and 18, 2008, Applicant submitted\nsigned copies of AE D and E, that were originally submitted without signatures. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to reopen the record and add these signed copies, without\nobjection by Department Counsel. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nFebruary 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice on February\n14, 2008. (Tr. at 14.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15\ndays notice before the hearing. Applicant confirmed his earlier election, discussed\nabove, and again affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. at 12-14.) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing the year in which\nApplicant was alleged to have resigned and suffered revocation of his former security\nclearance from \u201c2004\" to \u201c2002.\" (Tr. at 58.) Applicant did not object to the motion,\nwhich was granted in order to correct either a typographical error or misunderstanding,\nand to conform the SOR allegation to the undisputed evidence. (Tr. at 59.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted all of the\nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. The allegations are based on\nadmissions Applicant made in his SF 86 (GE 1), and during interviews with a Defense\nSecurity Service Special Agent on May 1, 2007 (GE 3), and May 7, 2007 (GE 2).\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of a start-up\ncorporation that is developing encryption technology for use in the government and\ncommercial sectors. He and his wife have been married since 1985, and have a 22-\nyear-old daughter. Applicant\u2019s wife and daughter live with her parents. Applicant resides\nmuch of the time in a distant state, where his business is located.\n\n3\nFor about 12 years, Applicant worked for another government agency in which\nhe was assigned to work in U.S. embassies abroad, and held a high-level security\nclearance. During one three-year overseas assignment, Applicant developed sexual\nrelationships with three women who worked at the embassy. Two of them were U.S.\ncitizens, and those relationships involved multiple sexual encounters. The third woman\nwas a local-national employee with whom he had sexual intercourse only once. \nAt Applicant\u2019s next assignment in a different country, Applicant developed a long-\nrunning sexual relationship with a 21-year-old local-national woman he met in a bar. He\nsoon learned that both she and her sister worked part-time as prostitutes to supplement\ntheir income. He and the woman had sex weekly until his transfer 18 months later.\nAbout two months after this relationship started, Applicant\u2019s wife moved back to the U.S.\ndue to a medical condition. Three months later, Applicant gave the local woman a key to\nhis apartment. Applicant returned to this country on short visits three and five months\nafter his transfer. He and the woman again had sexual relations during both visits.\nApplicant also paid several other prostitutes for sex while stationed in these two\ncountries. \nAlthough Applicant knew he was required to report sexual relationships with\nforeign nationals to his supervisor, he chose not to do so in order to keep the matters\nsecret and permit the relations to continue. About a year before Applicant left the\nsecond country, his mistress\u2019 sister visited them at his apartment with a foreign diplomat\nfor purposes of introducing the two men. Applicant was also required to report this\ncontact. He did report the contact, but falsified the circumstances under which it took\nplace in order to conceal his ongoing affair. (Tr. at 51-54, 63-67, 69-71.)\nShortly after leaving the second country in 1997, Applicant admitted to his wife, in\ngeneral terms, that he had a sexual relationship with his mistress there. He promised\nher that he would never have another extramarital affair, and asserts that he kept this\npromise. (See GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 56.) This claim, that he kept the promise, is inconsistent\nwith the admitted sexual activity during his two subsequent short return visits. (GE 2 at\n3; Tr. at 50-51.) Applicant has never admitted any of his other extramarital sexual\nactivity to his wife because it would upset her and he thinks she does not want to know.\n(GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 54-56, 62-65, 84.)\nAbout four and a half years after leaving the second country, Applicant was\nrequired to undergo a polygraph examination in connection with renewing his clearance.\nDuring the pre-test interview, he admitted to the 18-month relationship in the second\ncountry, and to lying to his boss about the meeting with the foreign diplomat. He\nunderwent a series of debriefings and polygraph examinations, and was eventually\ncleared to return to work. About nine months later, he was informed that his\nemployment was going to be terminated, and offered the option to resign or be fired. He\nchose the former option, which became effective in October 2002. Immediately\nthereafter, he founded his present company and began working to build the business.\n\n4\nApplicant submitted reference letters from five individuals, including board\nmembers and advisers of his company. They included one active-reserve and one\nretired general officer, former chief information officers for two security-related agencies,\nand a retired colonel who served as a career Intelligence officer. (Applicant\u2019s response\nto SOR; AE A through E; Tr. at 40-42.) Each offered a positive evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter. Applicant informed each person that he was seeking the letters in connection\nwith his hearing to try to obtain a security clearance, but he did not inform any of them\nof the details leading to revocation of his former clearance in 2002. (Tr. at 47-49, 72-73.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and,\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n\n6\n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\n \nApplicant engaged in multiple extramarital sexual relationships with prostitutes\nand coworkers over a five to six year period that ended about ten years ago. Some of\nthese were one-time events, and several involved longer relationships, including one\nthat lasted almost two years in total. Applicant revealed only general information about\nthe longest relationship to his wife, and resumed the affair on two occasions after\nrevealing it to her and promising to remain faithful. She knows nothing about those\nincidents, or any of the other relationships, and he does not want her to. He also\nconcealed this sexual activity from his supervisors at the time, and filed a falsified report\nconcerning contact with a foreign diplomat, despite his obligation to report such matters\nin connection with his  security clearance. This ultimately led to revocation of his\nclearance and termination of his Government employment in October 2002. Applicant\nalso concealed some or all of these matters from the board members and advisors to\nhis present company when he asked them to vouch for his character in connection with\nthese proceedings. This not only diminishes the evidentiary weight accorded to their\nopinions of his character, but increases the number of people for whom it is important to\nhim to perpetuate ignorance of his past conduct.\nThere is no evidence from which to conclude that Applicant\u2019s admitted solicitation\nof and participation in sexual relations with multiple prostitutes, while he was married to\nanother woman, was criminal in the two countries where this conduct took place.\nAccordingly, the Government has not established that AG \u00b6 13(a) applies. Applicant\napparently was able to stop the behavior about ten years ago, and no evidence was\nintroduced concerning personality disorder symptoms, so AG \u00b6 13(b) was not\nestablished. \nThe evidence does raise security concerns under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and 13(d),\nhowever. Applicant\u2019s concealment of virtually all of this activity from his wife, his then-\nsupervisors, and his current colleagues, demonstrates his susceptibility to coercion,\nexploitation, and duress should he be confronted by someone threatening to reveal it.\nMoreover, his extensive pattern of secretive and illicit casual sexual gratification, in\nviolation of legal and moral obligations to both his wife and the United States\nGovernment, reflects a serious lack of discretion and good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s sexual conduct of concern primarily took place when he was in his\nmid and late 30s, so AG \u00b6 14(a) does not provide mitigation. The latter half of the\nactivity took place when he was living separate from his wife, a situation mirroring his\ncurrent arrangements. The only evidence that such conduct might be unlikely to recur\nconcerned his pledge to his wife not to further cheat on her that he admittedly violated\ntwice, and his self-serving declaration that he intends not to repeat such actions. This\nevidence does not persuasively establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b), and his conduct\ncasts continuing doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s behavior serves as an ongoing basis for coercion, exploitation and\nduress because he continues to conceal it from his wife, family, and business\ncolleagues. Applicant persuaded five high ranking current and former Government\nofficials, on whom his future business prospects depend, to vouch for his character in\nthese official proceedings without his informing them of the nature and extent of his\nconduct raising security concerns. This both reflects his ongoing concern over public\nknowledge of his conduct and increases his ongoing susceptibility to coercion,\nexploitation or duress by enlarging the pool of people to whom revelation of his conduct\nwould be damaging and embarrassing. AG \u00b6 14(c) does not apply. Although much of\nApplicant\u2019s illicit sexual behavior was conducted in private, prostitution is not the type of\nconsensual behavior contemplated by AG \u00b6 14(d), nor was any of the conduct discreet\n(which means prudent or judicious). Applicant has not demonstrated that any AG \u00b6 14\nconditions apply to mitigate security concerns raised by his sexual behavior.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n8\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized\nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\n\n9\n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to\nthe employer as a condition of employment; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior, his deliberate lying to his supervisor about the\ncircumstances surrounding his meeting with his mistress, her sister, and the foreign\ndiplomat, and the resulting revocation of his security clearance and termination of his\nGovernment employment raise exploitation, manipulation or duress security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 16(e), for the same reasons discussed above under Guideline D. These\nactivities, if known, would adversely affect his personal, professional, and community\nstanding, particularly in light of his ongoing concealment of much of the information from\nhis family and business associates. Independent of prostitution\u2019s legal status in the\n\n10\nforeign countries involved, it is illegal in most jurisdictions of the U.S. He knowingly\nengaged in it multiple times, despite its evident potential to serve as a basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the security or intelligence services of those countries while\nhe was performing Government duties there. The Government did not assert any other\npotentially disqualifying condition under Guideline E. \nThe only potentially mitigating condition relating to security concerns arising from\nthis ongoing vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress is AG \u00b6 17(e), because\nthe existence of the past conduct remains of concern even if it was long ago and might\nbe considered unlikely to recur. Applicant has not taken any positive steps, such as\ndisclosure to his family and business associates, that could reduce or eliminate the\nvulnerability. To the contrary, he continues to conceal most of the details from these\npeople to protect his desire for ongoing beneficial relationships. Applicant has not\nestablished mitigation of security concerns raised by his personal conduct. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involved engaging in and deceptively concealing multiple extramarital sexual\nincidents, some arising from relationships formed in performance of his Government\nduties, and some with prostitutes, over a period of at least five years. He knowingly and\nvoluntarily committed and concealed each of these acts in violation of obligations to his\nwife and the U.S. Government. There is no evidence of illicit sexual conduct during the\nlast ten years, but Applicant\u2019s concealment of most details of his actions from his family\nand business colleagues is ongoing. The only evidence of rehabilitation or permanent\nbehavioral change concerning the sexual behavior is Applicant\u2019s testimony and\nstatement of intent to reform. The persuasiveness of his statements is weakened by his\n\n11\nadmission that he resumed extramarital sexual relations with his most recent mistress\nduring two visits to her country that he made after telling his wife about her and\npromising to be faithful in the future. Even should no further illicit sexual behavior take\nplace, Applicant\u2019s ongoing concealment of many of these events from family and\ncolleagues establishes continuing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from sexual behavior\nand personal conduct considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

On May 3, 2006,\nDOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 10, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe trustworthiness concerns raised under Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised\nunder Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated, in that he gave insufficient weight to the fact that\nApplicant was a motivated, devoted, hard-working employee, who was an expert in her field, and\nwho was not a threat to the Department of Defense.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nhe specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).\nThe Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case\nNo. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 1992).  The federal government has a strong interest in\nprotecting sensitive information and, pursuant to that interest, has to decide whether persons to be\nentrusted with access to such information are at risk of deliberately or inadvertently mishandling it.\nIn making such decisions, the government must determine whether a given person possesses and\nexhibits the high degree of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of persons granted\naccess to that information.  Trustworthiness determinations are not limited to consideration of an\napplicant's job performance or conduct during duty hours, and off-duty conduct can be relevant in\nassessing an applicant's security eligibility.  An applicant's technical expertise (or lack thereof) is not\na measure of whether the applicant is at risk of deliberately or inadvertently mishandling sensitive\ninformation, nor is it a measure of whether the applicant demonstrates the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons granted access to such information.  An applicant\nwith technical expertise may through conduct or circumstances demonstrate that he or she poses a\ntrustworthiness risk; an applicant without any technical expertise may through conduct or\ncircumstances demonstrate that he or she is a good candidate for a favorable trustworthiness\ndetermination.  The trustworthiness significance of the conduct alleged under Guidelines F and E\ndoes not turn on whether Applicant possesses a technical ability that could be useful to a DoD\ncontact or project.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-06033 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2005).\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\n\n3\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe determination of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems\nin ADP I/II/II sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On June 23, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 18, 2006,\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on\nDecember 19, 2006.  On April 4, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The\nGovernment moved to amend the SOR by striking subparagraph 1.g. and adding a phrase to\nsubparagraph 1.c. to incorporate that debt into the debt listed in subparagraph 1.c. to avoid\nduplication of debts.  Applicant had no objection, and I granted the motion. (Tr. 9, 10)  The\nGovernment and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is 26 years old, married, and works as a customer service representative for a\ndefense contractor in the health care insurance business.  Applicant started this job three years ago.\nHis wife works at the same company in another division.  Together, their gross income is $70,000.\nTheir monthly expenses are $3,245, minus the $600 the state pays his wife monthly for caring for\nher two young cousins.  Applicant and his wife have a monthly net income of $3,260.  His monthly\nnet income is $1,860 and her monthly net income is $1,400.  She owes $1,800 for furniture and\nappliances purchased for their house.  She also owes $2,000 on a personal loan she incurred in 2006.\n(Tr. 20-29, 34-42, 57, 58, 67; Exhibits 1, 4-6)\nIn July, 2006, they bought a house for $123,900, and placed the deed is in his wife\u2019s name.\nNo down payment was made because neither of them had any money with which to make a down\npayment.  They have two mortgages on the house, one for $99,000 at 6% interest, and the second\nmortgage for $24,000 at 12% interest.  Applicant makes the $900 monthly payment on both\nmortgages from his income.  These mortgages are adjustable rate loans, changing every three years.\nIn 2006, they also purchased a $23,000 used Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicle, placing the\ntitle in the wife\u2019s name, with no down payment being made.  The monthly payment on this loan is\n$500, which Applicant makes from his income.  The total payments for the car over the six year term\nof the fixed rate loan are $36,000.  The wife has title to these items because Applicant has bad credit\ndue to his unpaid debts, so it was easier for his wife to obtain the loans needed to purchase these\nitems.  When they married in September 2006 they spent $6,000 on their wedding, and $2,000 on\n\n4\nwedding rings.  The debt for the wedding rings is now reduced to $800. (Tr. 30-36, 49-57; Exhibits\n2-6)\nApplicant owes seven delinquent debts, totaling $8,992.  These debts arose from purchases\nhe made on several credit cards he took out while a college student, starting in 1998.  He used them\nfor living expenses.  He paid on one debt listed in subparagraph 1.d. for $2,629.  He paid $150\nmonthly for 11 payments between August 2005 to August 2006, for a total of $1,700.  He ceased\npayments when he got married in September 2006.  He has not made any payments on any of the\nother six debts for several years, though he expressed a willingness to pay them \u201ceventually.\u201d\nApplicant submitted a proposed household budget after the hearing showing he intends to pay $400\nmonthly to his creditors and has \u201cstarted setting up agreements for repayment with the proper\ncreditors\u201d over the next 20.5 months.  In his April 2005, statement to the Government investigator,\nhe stated his intent to contact his creditors and make repayment arrangements because he had\nsufficient income to start to repay his delinquent debts.  Since that time, he made only the one\nrepayment arrangement that he did not complete. (Tr. 18, 19, 32, 35, 36, 75; Exhibits 2-6, A)\nApplicant\u2019s character witness testified to his honesty and trustworthiness.  Applicant claims\nhe is a good employee and would not disclose confidential client information. (Tr. 45-48)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\n\n5\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F:Financial Considerations: The Concern: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. E2.A6.1.1\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F. Financial Considerations: Applicant borrowed money on his credit cards while\nin college with no ability to repay the money.  His current employment started three years ago, and\nhe has not tried to repay any creditor, except for partial payment to one creditor which ended when\nhe married in September 2006.  The SOR is dated June 2006, telling Applicant at that time of the\nGovernment\u2019s concern that he is not repaying regularly his delinquent debt, yet Applicant did\nnothing to repay those creditors.  Subsequently, Applicant spent, with his new wife, $6,000 for a\nwedding and $2,000 for wedding rings.  They purchased a house and a large automobile at about the\nsame time, totaling $146,000 in debt, with no down payments.  Therefore, while the Government\nwas concerned about $8,992 of delinquent debt, Applicant spent $154,000 to start his new married\n\n6\nlife, while not repaying aged delinquent debt.  After the hearing, Applicant formulated a household\nbudget designed to use $400 monthly to repay debt over the next 20.5 months, despite having\npreviously declared in April 2005, his intention to repay his delinquent debts, which he failed to do\nso.  His presentation is not persuasive based on his past record of non-payment.\nThe Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that apply to these facts are DC 1 (A history of not\nmeeting financial obligations E2.A6.1.2.1), and DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\nE2.A6.1.2.3).  Applicant has not repaid his delinquent debts, while spending his income on\nmortgages, loans, and other purchases.  Applicant had two years notice of the Government\u2019s concern\nabout these delinquent debts, as shown on his April 2005, statement.  Yet he took no significant\nremedial action to repay these debts.\nThere are no Mitigating Conditions that apply to these facts.  His present attempt to formulate\na budget and repay his creditors is not persuasive given the age of the debts and his two-year old\nstatement that he would start to repay the debts in 2005.\n\u201cWhole Person Concept:\u201d Under this concept, the elements I considered are set forth in the\nPOLICY section of this decision.  Applicant\u2019s age, the nature of the conduct, etc., do not\nrecommend a conclusion for Applicant.  He was an adult when he voluntarily took out these credit\ncards.  He knew what he was doing by charging money on the cards and that he could not repay the\nmonies because he was in college and did not have a job.  There are no behavioral changes because\nhe has incurred sizeable debt for a house and car with no down payments on either purchase .   He\nplaced a heavy financial burden on himself in the amount of $1,400 monthly, which is also the\nmonthly net amount of Applicant\u2019s joint income with his wife.  He participated in those purchases,\neven though title is in his wife\u2019s name due to  his bad credit history.  Based on his financial track\nrecord, there is a substantial likelihood of repetition of this type of behavior.  Lastly, there is a great\npossibility of pressure or coercion because of vulnerability caused by his debt load.\nTherefore, I conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d against Applicant.  I also conclude the\nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concept against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJohn D. Hyland, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On May 17, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising\nApplicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2,\n1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided upon the written record.\n\n2\nOn November 27, 2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Applicant was denied due\nprocess; and whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guidelines J and\nH is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant\u2019s counsel on appeal asks that the case be remanded so that Applicant can introduce\n\u201cdetailed information regarding successful completion of drug treatment, probation, and general\nemployment and lifestyle issues which were not made available to the Judge due to the appellant\u2019s\ndecision to represent himself during the proceeding below.\u201d  The Board construes Applicant\u2019s\nrequest as raising the issue of whether Applicant was denied due process.  In that regard, Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel has not demonstrated error by the Judge.\nA review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth\nin Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Applicant requested that his case be decided on the\nwritten record.  He was  provided with a copy of the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM),\nwhich contained the evidentiary exhibits upon which the Judge based his decision.  He was given\nan opportunity to object to those exhibits and provide his own evidence to rebut the government\u2019s\nallegations.  Applicant failed to object to the exhibits in the government\u2019s FORM or offer any\nevidence in his own behalf. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).  \nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that\nfailure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6\n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  Because Applicant did not object to the government\u2019s exhibits or provide\nhis own evidence with respect to the matters at issue, he has no valid claim for denial of due process\nunder the Directive or Executive Order, and is not entitled to a second opportunity to present\nevidence on his behalf.    \n(2) Applicant\u2019s counsel also contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security\nconcerns raised under Guidelines J and H had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, he\nargues that the Judge\u2019s findings overstate the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct by\ncharacterizing two of the four Guideline J allegations as criminal \u201ccharges\u201d for which Applicant paid\na \u201cfine\u201d rather than as \u201cordinance violations\u201d involving the \u201cforfeiture of money\u201d as provided for\nunder Wisconsin law.  Applicant\u2019s counsel also argues that Applicant \u201c has been drug free for at least\ntwo years, if not longer\u201d so that his drug use is \u201cnot recent.\u201d  Finally, Applicant\u2019s counsel restates\nthe other favorable evidence of record and argues that it was sufficient to support a favorable\ndetermination under the whole person concept.  In regard to that argument, he cites to several DOHA\nhearing decisions in which applicants with ostensibly similar circumstances received a favorable\ndecision.  These arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.    \nThe decision in another DOHA Hearing Office case does not demonstrate error by the Judge\nin this case.  A decision by a Hearing Office Judge is not legally binding precedent on DOHA Judges\nor the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. June 30, 2003).\n\n3\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).   The Board does not review a case de novo.  Considering the record evidence as a whole,\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern reflect a\nplausible interpretation of the record evidence and are sustainable.  Moreover, even if it were\nassumed for the purposes of this appeal that Applicant\u2019s characterization of two out the four criminal\nincidents was correct, it would not have materially affected the outcome of the case.\n \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the trustworthiness concerns presented by Applicant\u2019s prior conduct and circumstances had not\nbeen mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not\nestablished that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge specifically considered the recency of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse and the\nextent of his rehabilitation.  He made sustainable findings as to a serious history of improper or\nillegal drug and criminal conduct.  That history included: illegal marijuana use, sometimes on a daily\nbasis, from 1998 to at least 2003;  illegal use of cocaine, sometimes on a daily basis, between\nFebruary and July 2003; illegal use of ecstacy and crack; the purchase of marijuana; and instances\nof criminal conduct in 2000, 2003, and 2004.  The Directive does not define \u201crecent,\u201d and there is\nno \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct.  ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 5\n(App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).  The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach\na reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct.  ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at\n5 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).  Given the record in this case, it was not arbitrary, capricious or unlawful\nfor the Judge to conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use and criminal conduct were recent.  In that\nregard, the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances.  The Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence against other record evidence including the length and seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating\nevidence to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  Given the record that was before\nhim, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines J and H is not arbitrary,\n\n4\ncapricious or contrary to law.  Thus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a trustworthiness\ndesignation.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nBraden M. Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nFrom 1998 to 2005, Applicant accumulated 52 delinquent debts totaling about $29,300. In\nDecember 2006, she negotiated payment plans for 18 debts, paid off or resolved 14 debts, and\ntendered payment on one. Four debts are disputed. Fifteen debts totaling more than $19,000 are\nunresolved. Trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations are not mitigated.  Eligibility\nfor assignment to an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 7, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a favorable\ntrustworthiness determination and eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position.  This action was taken\nunder Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive), and Department of Defense\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified\n(Regulation).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Regulation, based on 52 delinquent debts totaling about $29,300.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 27, 2006, admitted the debts, submitted proof\nthat some debts had been resolved, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The\ncase was assigned to me on November 9, 2006.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on November\n27, 2006, and the case was heard on December 11, 2006, as scheduled.   Applicant affirmatively\nwaived the 15-day notice required by the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8 (Tr. 31).  I kept the record open to enable\nApplicant to submit additional evidence.  I received the hearing transcript and Applicant\u2019s additional\nevidence on December 29, 2006.  Department Counsel\u2019s response to her additional evidence is\nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  Her additional evidence has been incorporated into the\nrecord as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) L through Y.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting the reference to\nthe Regulation.  I granted the motion in part by deleting the reference to the outdated paragraph cited\nin the SOR, but I denied the portion of the motion requesting that the entire reference to the\nRegulation be deleted (Tr. 17-26).  I announced at the hearing that I would apply the adjudicative\nguidelines in the Regulation and follow the procedures in the Directive (Tr. 25).  The issue whether\nthe guidelines in the Regulation or those in the Directive should apply to this case is moot, because\nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Directive under Guideline F are the same as those\nin the Regulation.  Department Counsel\u2019s post-hearing submission on the issue is attached to the\nrecord as Hearing Exhibit II.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 28-year-old beneficiary service representative employed by a defense\ncontractor and working at a military medical facility.  She has worked for her current employer since\nJuly 2004, and has established a reputation for professionalism and attention to detail (AX L, M).\n One beneficiary referred to her as \u201chis angel\u201d in her employer\u2019s newsletter (AX N).  Her most recent\nperformance appraisal scored her performance as 280 on a 300-point scale where any rating above\n240 means the employee exceeded expectations (AX O).  She received salary increases in April 2005\nand April 2006 for exceptional performance (AX P, Q, R). \n\n4\nApplicant dropped out of high school before graduating.  She obtained her GED certificate\nand has been enrolled as a part-time university student since 2002.  She has completed about half\nthe requirements for graduating from a four-year program with a major in biology (Tr. 7, 48-49). She\nwas married in September 2006 (Tr. 37), and she has an eight-year-old son from a previous\nrelationship.  She has never received a trustworthiness determination (Tr. 56).\nThe SOR alleges 52 delinquent debts totaling more than $29,300.  Applicant admitted all the\ndebts in her answer to the SOR, and she presented documentary evidence that some of the debts had\nbeen paid.  She also produced evidence that she paid some delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR\n(AX G).

In her interview with the security\ninvestigator in March 2005, Applicant stated she intended to seek consumer credit counseling and\nconsolidate her debts (GX 3 at 2, 4).  At the hearing, she testified she was unable to enroll in a\nconsumer counseling program because many of her creditors were unwilling to accept installment\npayments (Tr. 93-94).\nThe bad checks alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g were uttered to a restaurant between\nOctober 6, 1998, and October 17, 1998, for amounts between $33.90 and $40.25.  In an interview\nwith a security investigator in March 2005, Applicant asserted she had no knowledge of the bad\nchecks, but she surmised that they might be connected to the theft of her purse in 1998 (GX 2 at 7).\nShe has paid off all the checks.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h arose from the repossession of a car jointly purchased by\nApplicant and her then-boyfriend.  They parted ways and the boyfriend moved to another state and\nmarried someone else.  Applicant kept the car but was unable to make the payments.  The car was\nrepossessed in November 1998.  She contacted the creditor in June 2006 and learned that the creditor\nobtained a judgment against the ex-boyfriend.  The deficiency owed after repossession of the car was\n$8,219, but it has increased to more than $15,000 because of interest, penalties, and related costs.\nApplicant had no contact with the creditor after June 2006 (Tr. 60-64).\nApplicant began working for an ambulance service in February 2000 and had medical\ninsurance. She was treated for carpal tunnel syndrome in 2001 and for various ailments in 2003,\nabout which she could remember little.  Although she had medical insurance, it did not cover the\nmedical bills in full (Tr. 68-69).  She was unemployed from January to February 2004, and then\nemployed part-time with no medical insurance July 2004 (Tr. 69-70). \nThe medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k were for treatment received by Applicant in\nFebruary 2000 (GX 3 at 1).  The medical bill in SOR \u00b6 1.s was for treatment of her son\u2019s ear\ninfections in October 2001 (GX 3 at 2).  The medical bills in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.ll, 1.ss, 1.tt, and 1.vv were\nrelated to her miscarriage in February 2004 (GX 3 at 6, 9; Tr. 66-67).\n\n7\nThe medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.ff, 1.gg, and 1.hh were incurred when Applicant was\nin an automobile accident with a drunk driver in June 2003.  She sued the other driver and received\na settlement in December 2003.  She assumed her lawyer had settled the medical bills (GX 3 at 10).\nIn her security interview in March 2006, Applicant asserted that the cable service bill in SOR\n\u00b6 1.kk had been paid in full (GX 3 at 11).  At the hearing, she admitted she had probably overlooked\nthis bill and that it was unpaid (Tr. 82).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i occurred when Applicant contracted for fashion photography\nin the late 1990s.  The original bill was for more than $1,200.  After paying about $500, Applicant\nreceived only five photographs.  Because she thought she received less than she contracted for, she\nrefused to make any further payments (Tr. 90).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r arose when Applicant\u2019s apartment and furniture were damaged\nby water leaking from another apartment above her.  When the apartment owner refused to pay for\nthe damage to her furniture, she moved out and was charged one month\u2019s rent for early termination\nof the lease.  She paid half the amount demanded, and refused to pay the remainder (Tr. 86-87).\nThe cell phone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.v arose when Applicant gave her son\u2019s grandmother\na cell phone with the understanding the grandmother would make the payments.  When the\ngrandmother failed to pay the bill, Applicant remained responsible (Tr. 79-80).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.zz occurred when Applicant switched long distance carriers but\nthe original carrier continued to bill her, resulting in double billing for her long distance service.\nApplicant disputes this debt (Tr. 91-92).\nApplicant\u2019s Current Financial Situation\nIn a personal financial statement dated March 15, 2005, Applicant reported net monthly\nincome of $1,927.46 (including $366 in child support from her son\u2019s father), household expenses\nof $955, debt payments of $420, and a net remainder of $552.46 (GX 3 at 16).  Her income remained\nat the same level at the time of the hearing (Tr. 95).  Her personal financial statement does not reflect\nher student loans totaling between $25,000 and $30,000, on which payments are deferred (Tr. 105).\nHer husband owns a lawn service company and earns about $1,200 per month.  He works weekends\nas a musician, earning an additional $1,200 per weekend (Tr. 96).  Her husband has taken\nresponsibility for paying all the household expenses, allowing her to use her monthly income to pay\nboth her current and delinquent debts (Tr. 104).  She has virtually no savings, but she has about\n$3,000 in her 401k account (Tr. 103-04, 115).  She no longer has any credit cards (Tr. 103).\nIn March 2005, Applicant listed monthly rent of $750, of which her fianc\u00e9 paid half.  At the\nhearing she testified she and her husband now pay rent of $550 (Tr. 98).  In March 2005, she also\nlisted a car payment of $298 among her debt payments.  This payment was for a used 1999 Dodge\ntruck, for which she had paid about $12,000.  It turned out to be a \u201clemon,\u201d and after spending\nalmost $5,000 on it, she traded it for a used 2002 Mercedes C240 at a cost of more than $20,000,\nincreasing her monthly car payments to $623 (Tr. 98-99, 109, 118).\n\n8\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out in the Regulation are used to make ADP trustworthiness\ndeterminations.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures\ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  Regulation\n\u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.  ADP III positions are \u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  Regulation \u00b6\nC3.1.2.2.  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions of the Directive\nto ADP I, II, and III positions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense\n(Counterintelligence and Security) dated November 19, 2004.  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty,\nreliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.  Appendix 8 of the\nRegulation sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions under each guideline.  \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Regulation Appendix\n8 at 132.  Each eligibility determination must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based\non the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed\nin the Regulation. \nIn security clearance cases, the government  initially must present substantial evidence to\nestablish controverted facts in the SOR that may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for\naccess to classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,\n380 (4th Cir. 1994).  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness\ndeterminations for ADP positions.\n\n9\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nUnder this guideline, \u201c[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.  A person who fails or\nrefuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless\nin his or her duty to protect classified information.  Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this\nguideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where\nan applicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  DC 3 applies where an\napplicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Id.  Applicant\u2019s financial history\nis sufficient to raise DC 1 and DC 3.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 and DC 3, the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving\nit is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent\ndebts were not recent (MC 1) or was an isolated incident (MC 2).  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.\nApplicant has multiple delinquent debts that are not yet fully resolved.  I conclude MC 1 and MC\n2 are not established.\nSecurity concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the\nresult of conditions \u201clargely beyond the person\u2019s control\u201d (MC 3).  Id.  Even if Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond her control, it is appropriate to consider\nwhether she acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties.  ISCR Case\nNo. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began shortly after the birth of her son in 1998, and several\nevents occurred that were beyond her control.  Her purse and checkbook were stolen in 1998.  She\nhad periods of unemployment or part-time employment that left her without medical insurance. She\nwas injured by a drunk driver and her car was totaled in June 2003.  She suffered a miscarriage in\nFebruary 2004.  Her son had medical problems that were not fully covered by insurance.  She gave\na cell phone to her son\u2019s grandmother and was unaware that the grandmother neglected to pay for\nthe service as she had promised.  Her Dodge truck turned out to be a \u201clemon\u201d requiring expensive\nrepairs.  \nOn the other hand, she did not respond reasonably to her financial difficulties.  She failed to\nresolve any unpaid bills after gaining full-time employment in July 2004, even though her personal\nfinancial statement reflects a net monthly remainder of more than $500.  Eight delinquent debts were\nfor less than $100, and four were for between $100 and $152, but she took no action to pay any of\nher delinquent debts until shortly before the hearing.  When she needed to replace her lemon truck,\nshe did not purchase another similar vehicle, but instead purchased a more expensive car that\nincreased her monthly car payments by more than $300.  I conclude MC 3 is not established.\n\n10\nA mitigating condition (MC 4) applies when an applicant \u201chas received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control.\u201d  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.  MC 4 is not established because Applicant has not\nsought financial counseling.\nA security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith\neffort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Id.  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts\nin a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past\nirresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security\nclearance.  \nApplicant knew in March 2005, when she was interviewed by a security investigator, that her\nfinancial situation raised trustworthiness concerns.  Applicant did not take any significant steps to\nresolve her delinquent debts until after she received the SOR in June 2006.  Nevertheless, several\ndebts have been paid or resolved (SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.g, 1.ee, 1.mm, 1.pp, 1.ss, 1.tt, 1.uu, and 1.yy), and\nthey no longer raise trustworthiness concerns.  I resolve the allegations regarding these debts in her\nfavor.\nApplicant has disputed several debts, for reasons that I found plausible and credible.  I\nresolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.r, 1.u, and 1.zz in her favor.\nApplicant has negotiated payment plans for several debts, with payments beginning in\nDecember 2006 and January 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.j, 1.k, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t, 1.w, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, 1.dd, 1.ff,\n1.gg, 1.hh, 1.jj, 1.nn, and 1.oo).  These payment plans are steps in the right direction, but they are\nnot sufficient to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns under DC 1 and DC 3, for three reasons.  First,\nthey were negotiated under pressure of qualifying for a trustworthiness determination.  Second,\nApplicant has not yet established a track record indicating she is likely to follow through on the\npayment plans.  \u201cOnly with the passage of time will there be a track record that shows whether a\nperson, through actions and conduct, is willing and able to adhere to a stated intention to refrain from\nacting in a way that the person has acted in the past.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS\n302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998).  Third, there is no evidence showing likelihood of resolution of\n15 debts totaling more than $19,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.h, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.v, 1.aa, 1.bb, 1.kk, 1.ll, 1.qq, 1.rr,\n1.vv, 1.ww, and 1.xx.).  Applicant was not required, as a matter of law, to establish that she had\nresolved every debt.  See ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006).  Nevertheless, the\nnumber and dollar amount of the unresolved debts, her inaction until she received the SOR, and her\nlack of a good financial track record leave me unconvinced that she has made or will continue to\nmake a good faith effort to resolve all her debts.  I conclude MC 6 is not established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\n\n11\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Regulation Appendix\n8 at 132.  Some of these factors are addressed in the discussion of Guideline F above, but some merit\nadditional comment.\nApplicant appears to be an exceptionally bright, articulate woman.  She enjoys her job and\nhas done it well.  She works hard to improve her educational level.  However, her failure to pay off\nher numerous small debts even though she had a net monthly remainder of about $500 is\ntroublesome.  Her purchase of an expensive automobile at a time she was in financial distress did\nnot demonstrate financial acuity. \nApplicant\u2019s resolution of many debts and skillful negotiation of several payment agreements\nwere steps in the right direction.  If she adheres to those payment agreements and addresses the\nunpaid and unresolved debts, she may well qualify for a favorable determination in the future.  See\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37, E3.1.38 (reconsideration after one year).  However, based on her record to date,\nshe has not mitigated the trustworthiness concern based on financial considerations.  Accordingly,\nI conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant her a favorable trustworthiness determination.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

He has not made any good faith efforts to resolve the debt. Applicant\ndeliberately failed to list his delinquent accounts on his trustworthiness application.  He has failed\nto mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations and personal conduct.\nApplicant's eligibility for a trustworthiness position is denied.\n\nThis action is taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \u201cAdjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\u201d dated November 19, 2004.\nThe government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated August 19, 2006) at 1-2.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 21, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On July 28, 2006, DOHA\n1\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which\nis in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\nOn August 19, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on October 12, 2006. Applicant received a complete file of relevant\nmaterial (FORM) on October 17, 2006, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  Applicant did not submit\n2\nany information or written response to the FORM by November 16, 2006. The case was assigned\nto me on January 11, 2007.\nRULING ON PROCEDURE\nOn October 11, 2006, the government moved to amend the SOR. The introductory paragraph\non page one was struck in its entirety and replaced with:\nA review of your eligibility for occupying Information Systems Position designated ADP-II\nto support a contract with the Department of Defense (DoD) has been made pursuant to DoD\nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, This office recommends that your case be submitted to an\nAdministrative Judge for a determination that you are not eligible for occupying such a position. \nThe Applicant did not object to the motion. I granted the government\u2019s motion to amend the\nSOR. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations in his SOR response under Guideline F, but denied the\nallegation under Guideline E concerning his alleged failure to disclose debts on his ADP\napplication.  The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the\n3\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\n\nItem 4 (Application for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), dated October 24, 2004) at 1-11.\n4\nItem 7 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to Financial Interrogatories ), dated May 20, 2006.\n5\nItem 4, supra note 4 at 1-11.\n6\nItem 5 (Credit Bureau Report, dated January 21, 2005) at 1-10.\n7\nItem 7, supra note 6, at 1-4.\n8\nItem 6 (Credit Bureau Report, dated April 12, 2006) at 1-5.\n9\nId. at 1-5.\n10\n4\nApplicant is a single, 29-year-old claims auditor of a defense contractor, seeking a position\nof public trust. After graduating from high school, he worked and attended a community college. He\nreceived an associate degree in 1998, and continued to take college courses and work. He received\nhis undergraduate degree in 2003. He has no prior military experience. He has been with his current\nemployer since October 2004.  His 2005 performance evaluation rated him as \u201cexceeding\n4\nexpectations.\u201d  \n5\nOn October 21, 2004, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85-P).6\nHe answered \"No\" in response to question 22.b. Your Financial Record - 180 Day Delinquencies\nwhich reads: \"Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include\nloans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.).\" His background\ninvestigation revealed nine delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of $13,537.   \n7\nApplicant\u2019s nine debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a through 1.i are not disputed.  He provided no\n8\ninformation on the origin of the debts. He acknowledges that all the debts are delinquent and\n\u201ccurrently not in repayment.\u201d Several of the debts have been in collection since 1999.  The record\n9\nis devoid of any information concerning counseling or debt consolidation plans. Although Applicant,\nproclaimed he is committed to the repayment of the debt, he admitted his current strained financial\nsituation would need to improve before he could plan to repay the debt. Applicant did not  provide\nany mitigating conditions involving medical problems or other extenuating circumstances. \n \nHis outstanding debts corresponding to the SOR \u00b6 1. a. through 1.i.  are as follows: $1,883\ncredit account in collection in June 1999; $4,969 credit account in collection in October 1999; $293\naccount charged off in November 1999; $1,943 account charged off in July 2000; $2,354 collection\naccount July 2000; $880 account in collection in November 2000; $451 account in collection in\nSeptember 2001; $467 medical account in collection in October 2001; and $297 medical account in\ncollection in October 2001.10\nApplicant\u2019s October public trust application reveals employment with a book store from\nOctober 1994 until January 2001. From January 2001 until June 2001 he was unemployed. He\nworked with a newspaper for approximately four months in 2001 and was again unemployed from\nOctober 2001 until October 2002. He worked as a research data manager from October 2002 until\nDecember 2003. His last period of unemployment lasted from December 2003 until October 2004,\n\nItem 3, supra note 3.\n11\nApplicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement, dated May 20, 2006.\n12\n Department of the Navy v.

He provided no details about his unemployment or how it\ndirectly impacted his finances in any of his responses to the SOR.  \n11\nApplicant has a net monthly income of $1,760. The reported expenses of $1,683 left a net\nremainder of $32. Applicant is currently paying the minimum amount on four accounts listed on his\nfinancial statement .  He has no savings or assets except his automobile. His 2006 credit report lists\n12\nseveral student loans in forbearance.\nApplicant denied that he deliberately failed to list his delinquent debts on his public trust\napplication form because \"he misread or misunderstood question 22.\" It was in no way my intention\nto report false, inaccurate, or misleading information.\" He stated he is committed to total compliance\nwith regard to the truthful release of any and all information requested as part of his trustworthiness\nprocedure. He did not elaborate on why or how he misunderstood the question. The debts have been\ncharged off or placed in collection since 1999. I do not find his vague statement reasonable under\nthe circumstances.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n13\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to\ngenerate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless\nin their obligation to protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving\nresponsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how\na person may behave in other aspects of life.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n14\n Id.\n15\n Id.\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n20\n6\nto comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information. \nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n14\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n15\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n16\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.17\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\n18\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to\n19\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access\n20\nto sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations,\nand Guideline E - Personal Conduct. \nFinancial Considerations\n\n7\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant's case.  Applicant had difficulty meeting his financial\nobligations since 1999.  Currently, he has nine delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of\n$13,537. He admits his financial situation is strained. His 2006 credit report confirms the debt.\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).  Applicant's\ndelinquent debts remain outstanding. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was\nnot recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated) because he still carries a significant\namount of delinquent debt.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) does not apply. Applicant had periods of unemployment, but provided\nno evidence as to the effect on his finances. Moreover, some of the debt precedes the unemployment.\nTwo accounts are for medical care, but the majority are consumer accounts. Applicant provided no\nevidence to support this mitigating condition. Also, an applicant's actions towards resolving the debt\nshould be considered.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply.\nApplicant indicates that he intends to repay based on an improved financial situation. A promise to pay\nin the future is not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concern. All of the  debts remain\noutstanding. He has not taken steps to resolve these debts. Applicant's financial problems remain.  It\nis unlikely they will be resolved in the near future. The record is devoid of any information concerning\nfinancial counseling.\nFC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Applicant has not shown that he established a record of\nsteady payments or financial stability. He made no attempts to resolve any of the delinquent accounts\nI cannot conclude that he made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts despite his good intentions. \nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.  \nIn this case, Applicant explained that he did not list his delinquent debts in response to question\n22 on the public trust application because he did not understand the question. He  did not provide any\nreason for this misunderstanding.  I find that he intentionally withheld information about his delinquent\ndebts in response to question 22 on his public trust application signed by him on October 21, 2004.\nIn his financial interrogatories, dated May 2006, Applicant acknowledges that he has the debts and has\n\n8\nnot paid due to a strained financial situation. The evidence indicates that he was aware of his financial\nsituation when he filled out his public trust application.\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities) applies.  Although Applicant claims that he had no intent to report\nfalse, inaccurate, or misleading information, he provides no reasonable explanation for not listing his\ndebts. He was required to provide a truthful answer to question 22. When he signed the application,\nhe certified that his answers were \"true, complete, and correct to best of his knowledge and belief and\nare made in good faith.\" However, he admits that he had the debts, but did not list them on his public\ntrust application. I find his actions were deliberate.\nI find that none of the mitigating conditions apply under personal conduct. Applicant has failed\nto mitigate the personal conduct concern. Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that\nhas negative trustworthiness implications. It is premature to grant Applicant a trustworthiness position\nbased on his deliberate failure to disclose his delinquent debts and his lack of action towards resolving\nhis delinquent accounts. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

He did not disclose his foreign military service on his\nsecurity clearance application.  His mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  He had email\nexchanges with three former college classmates in Taiwan.  He has refuted the allegations of foreign\npreference and intentional falsification of his security clearance application, and he has mitigated the\nsecurity concern based on foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference), B (Foreign Influence), and E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 17, 2007, and he submitted a supplemental\nanswer on May 22, 2007.  A hearing was requested by Department Counsel in accordance with\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.8 (Tr. 14).  The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2007, and heard on August 13,\n2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open to enable Applicant to submit additional evidence.  I\nreceived additional evidence on August 21, 2007, and it was admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX)\nDD.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior network engineer for a defense contractor.  He has worked\nfor his current employer since March 2002.  He does not have a clearance.  \nApplicant\u2019s  performance appraisals from 2003 to the present have all rated him as far\nexceeding expectations, except for one year when he was rated as consistently exceeding\nexpectations (AX O-S).  His colleagues and supervisors describe him as talented, loyal,\nconscientious, hard-working, and committed to his family (AX T-W).  He and his family are heavily\ninvolved in scholastic, cultural, and community activities (AX X-CC).\nApplicant was born and educated in Taiwan, receiving a bachelor of science in civil\nengineering in July 1982 (AC X).  He performed mandatory military service in the Taiwanese Army\nfrom September 1982 to June 1984 (AX D).  Military-age men were required to satisfy their military\nservice obligation before they were permitted to leave Taiwan (AX A and B).  He came to the U.S.\nin August 1984 to continue his education (AX E at 2), and he has never returned to Taiwan to visit\nfriends or family (Tr. 81).  \nIn December 1987, Applicant received a master\u2019s degree in operations research and statistics\nfrom a U.S. educational institution (Tr. 7).  Applicant met his wife, a citizen of Taiwan who was\nborn in the Republic of Korea, while working on his master\u2019s degree.  They were married in the U.S.\nin October 1988, and they both became U.S. citizens in August 2000.  They have two children who\nare native-born U.S. citizens.  \n\n SOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that Applicant\u2019s parents served in or worked for the Taiwanese Air Force for approximately\n1\n20 years.  At Department Counsel\u2019s request, I amended SOR \u00b6 2.a to substitute \u201csix years\u201d for \u201c20 years\u201d to conform\nto the evidence (Tr. 122-24).\n4\nApplicant sends his two sons to Chinese school for two hours each Sunday, because he wants\nthem to learn to speak and write Chinese and learn about Chinese culture (Tr. 85).  He believes that\nChinese is becoming an international business language, making fluency in that language and\nfamiliarity with Chinese culture valuable economic assets (Tr. 86).\nApplicant\u2019s father served as a logistics officer in the Taiwanese Air Force for about six years\nshortly after World War II (AX I) .  His mother worked as a civilian secretary for the Taiwanese Air\n1\nForce at the same time.  His sister became a U.S. citizen in 1985, and she sponsored both parents\nwhen they came to the U.S. and became U.S. citizens during the late 1980s and early 1990s (Tr. 87).\nHis parents are retired (Tr. 92).\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  His father-in-law is deceased.\nHis mother-in-law visited the U.S. on three occasions: Applicant\u2019s marriage, the birth of his first son\nin 1991, and the birth of his second son in 1997 (Tr. 69).  His telephonic contact with his mother-in-\nlaw is limited to brief, courteous greetings on special occasions such as her birthday or the Chinese\nNew Year (Tr. 70).  His telephone records reflect 15 calls to Taiwan during the past year, of which\neight were received by his mother-in-law\u2019s answering machine (AX N; Tr. 70-71).  The telephone\ncalls were initiated by Applicant\u2019s wife (Tr. 70).\nBetween January 2005 and February 2007, Applicant had email contact with three former\ncollege classmates in Taiwan.  Applicant initiated the contact after seeing a classmate\u2019s name on the\ncollege website.  None of his former classmates are connected to the Taiwanese government or\nmilitary or involved in information technology.  One of his classmates is a professor of civil\nengineering at a private, church-affiliated university (Answer to SOR; GX 3; AX M at 3).  They had\none telephone call and three or four emails exchanging news articles, but their exchanges \u201cdied down\nquickly\u201d and ended in October 2005 (GX 2 at 21; Tr. 72).  Similarly, Applicant had one telephone\ncall and four or five emails with another classmate who studied literature and pursued a career in the\narts rather than engineering, the last email occurring  in February 2007 (Tr. 109).  \nApplicant had a more extensive exchange with a third former classmate, an environmental\nengineer.  They exchanged 30-40 emails.  For the first three months, they exchanged about two\nemails a week, and then the frequency quickly dwindled.  The emails consist of exchanges of general\nfamily information, family photographs, greeting cards, news articles, movie clips, cartoons, jokes,\nand one article about self-administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (AX DD; Tr. 104-06). \nApplicant\u2019s last telephone conversation with this friend was in May or June 2005 (Tr. 105),\nand his last email as of the date of the hearing was in June 2007 (AX DD at 93-96).  The June 2007\nemail was preceded by a Chinese New Year greeting in February 2007, with no intervening\nexchanges (AX DD at 83-89).\nApplicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on April 27, 2005.  He answered\n\u201cno\u201d to question 11, asking, \u201cHave you ever served in the military?\u201d  He did not disclose his\nmandatory military service in the Taiwanese Army.  In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he\n\n5\nexplained that he answered the question in the negative because he thought it applied only to service\nin the U.S. military.\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy established as a separate, independent government by\nrefugees from mainland China in 1949.  It is a major trading partner of the U.S. (Hearing Exhibit\n(HX) I at 2).  It  has a long history of cooperation with the U.S. military, including participation in\nU.S.-sponsored clandestine intelligence missions during the Cold War, in Korea, and in Vietnam\n(AX F, G, J, K, L).  Although Applicant\u2019s father served in the Taiwanese Air Force shortly after\nWorld War II and worked in civil aviation after his military service, he did not directly participate\nin Taiwanese-U.S. clandestine missions (Tr. 90).\nUntil January 1979, the U.S. recognized Taiwan\u2019s independence.  After that date, the U.S.\nformally recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China\nand adopted a \u201cone China\u201d policy.  Taiwan has significant economic contacts with the PRC, but its\nnational security remains under constant threat from the PRC, prompting Taiwan to maintain a large\nmilitary establishment.  Taiwan obtains most of its defensive weapons from the U.S. (Hearing\nExhibit (HX I, Enclosure I at 8-9).  The Taiwan Relations Act, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3316, is the legal\nbasis for the unofficial relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan and the U.S. commitment to\nensuring Taiwan\u2019s defensive capability.  Taiwan is an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence\n(HX I at 2, 4-5).\nThe PRC has an authoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party.  It\nhas a large and increasingly sophisticated military.  It is the fourth largest economy in the world, and\nits primary trading partners include Taiwan and the U.S. (HX I, Enclosure VIII at 9, 13).  The U.S.\nis a primary intelligence target of the PRC, which uses illegal means, including espionage, to steal\nadvanced technology from the U.S.  The PRC maintains intelligence operations in Hong Kong,\nMacau, and Taiwan, using PRC nationals with connections in those locations (HX I at 2-3).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\n6\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG\n\u00b6 9.  A security concern may be raised by \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to  military service for a foreign\ncountry.  AG \u00b6 10(a)(2).  In this case, Applicant\u2019s military service was mandatory, not voluntary, and\nit occurred before he emigrated to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen.  The concern under AG \u00b6\n10(a)(2) is not raised by the evidence.  No other disqualifying conditions under this guideline are\nraised.  The security concern under this guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\n\n7\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, a\ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a\nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Both conditions\nare raised by evidence that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.b)\nand evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with former classmates who are citizens and residents of\nTaiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.c).  \nApplicant refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.d that his former classmate is employed at a\ngovernment-operated university.  The evidence shows his classmate works at a private, church-\naffiliated university.  This allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThe service of Applicant\u2019s parents in the Taiwanese Air Force (SOR \u00b6 2.a) does not raise any\ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) are not raised, because they are\ncitizens and residents of the U.S., not Taiwan.  AG \u00b6 7(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) is not raised because Applicant does not live with\nhis parents.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(f) (\u201cfailure to report, when required, association with a foreign national\u201d), 7(g)\n(\u201cunauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, or employee of a foreign\nintelligence service\u201d), and 7(h) (\u201cindications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country\nare acting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation, indecement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) are not raised because his parents are not foreign nationals,\nrepresentatives of a foreign government, or connected with a foreign intelligence service.  \nMindful that the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each\nindividual family tie must be considered (ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003)),\nI have also considered that there is no contact or connection between Applicant\u2019s parents and his\nmother-in-law, and his parents have no continuing contacts with former Air Force colleagues or the\n\n8\nTaiwanese government.  The record reflects that his parents have severed all contacts with Taiwan\nand established a new life as U.S. citizens and residents.  I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15; see ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59\n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the\nburden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.\nSep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that\na person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's\nspouse.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  \nApplicant has minimal contact with his mother-in-law.  He met his wife while studying in\nthe U.S., was married in the U.S., and has never returned to Taiwan.  His mother-in-law visited him\nand his spouse on only three special occasions.  Applicant has only infrequent courtesy telephone\ncalls with his mother-in-law.  I conclude that Applicant has rebutted the presumption that he has ties\nof affection for his mother-in-law, but he did not address, and therefore has not rebutted, the\npresumption that he has ties of family obligation.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 75 years old, retired, and unconnected with the Taiwanese\ngovernment, military, or industries likely to be involved in industrial espionage.  His three former\nclassmates are unconnected to the Taiwanese government or military.  One is a professor of civil\nengineering, one is an environmental engineer, and one has pursued a career in the arts.  None of his\nformer classmates are involved in high-technology, computer-related businesses.  While the PRC\nis known to collect intelligence through its connections in Taiwan, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and\ncollege classmates are unlikely targets because they are unconnected to the government, military, or\nhigh-technology businesses.\nTaiwan is not known to abuse its citizens as an intelligence-gathering tool.  Taiwan is a close\nally, friend, and trading partner of the U.S., and is dependent on the U.S. for its defense.  The nature\nof Taiwan\u2019s government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the U.S. are clearly not\ndeterminative.  Nevertheless, they are all relevant factors in determining whether Taiwan would risk\ndamaging its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order to\nforce a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S.  After evaluating all the evidence, I conclude the mitigating\ncondition in AG \u00b6 8(a) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  While Applicant has some sense of obligation to his mother-\n\n9\nin-law, all his immediate family members are citizens and residents of the U.S.  He has resided in\nthe U.S. for 27 years and is deeply involved in pursuing the American dream for himself and his\nfamily.  I conclude the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(b) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(c).  Applicant\u2019s contact with his\nmother-in-law is limited to courteous holiday greetings once or twice a year.  Applicant\u2019s contact\nwith two of his classmates was infrequent from the beginning.  It was more frequent with a third\nformer classmate, but those contacts have dwindled down to an occasional email.  The level of\nconversation with all three friends has been superficial and does not show the depth of personal\ninterest or involvement sufficient to raise a security concern.  See ISCR Case No. 04-08870 at 3 n.1)\n(App. Bd. Nov. 29,2006). I conclude that the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(c) is partially\nestablished.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15.  The\nrelevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  AG\n\u00b6 16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the\nomission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing his mandatory military service in the Taiwanese\nArmy was plausible.  At the hearing, he was very candid, sincere, and credible.  I conclude he has\nrefuted the allegation of intentional falsification, and that no disqualifying conditions under this\nguideline are raised.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\n\n10\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, intensely loyal adult.  He cut his ties to Taiwan in 1984,\nand he never looked back until he decided to check the website of his alma mater and initiated the\ncontacts with former classmates.  His conversations with his foreign former classmates have never\nprogressed beyond superficial exchanges.  \nApplicant\u2019s enrollment of his two sons in Chinese classes does not reflect a preference or\ninclination toward China.  Instead, it reflects Applicant\u2019s desire to acquaint his sons with China\u2019s\nrich history and culture and prepare them for living in a world where China is a significant political\nand economic player.\nApplicant was very candid, articulate, and sincere at the hearing.  He and his entire\nimmediate family have made their lives in the U.S.  The likelihood that he would succumb to\nattempted pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is nil.\nAfter weighing the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, considering the\nnature of the countries involved, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person,\nI conclude Applicant has refuted the allegations under Guidelines C and E, and he has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nParagraph 2.  Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3.

Clearance is granted.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The government alleged in SOR 1 that Applicant drank alcohol at times to excess between June 2003 and September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that in June 2003 she was charged with and convicted of DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that in March 2004 she was again charged with and convicted of DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that in September 2004 she was charged with and convicted of DUI, and that the charge was still pending trial as of the SOR issuance (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In response, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. She denied being arrested in March 2004, and claimed she was arrested for an unsubstantiated violation of the terms of her sentence from her June 2003 conviction. Under SOR 2, the government alleged Applicant deliberately falsified her response to question 16 of her SF 85P (arrests, charges, and/or convictions for any offense in the past seven years) by omitting the two arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that she deliberately falsified her answer to question 22 (debts currently more than 180 days past) by omitting from her answer several delinquent debts listed in SOR 3. (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant denied intentionally falsifying her answers to the SF 85P. Under SOR 3, the government alleged Applicant owed approximately $19,900 for 16 unpaid debts that have either been charged off as business losses or referred for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a - 3.p).

MALONE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns about her use of alcohol, two alcohol-related\narrests, her financial problems, and her deliberate falsification of her Application for a Position of\nTrust (SF 85P). Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 17, 2004, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P).\nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that\n1\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust. On May 2,\n2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security\nconcerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline G (alcohol), Guideline E (personal conduct),\nGuideline F (financial considerations), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\na DOHA administrative judge on October 13, 2006. A hearing scheduled for November 21, 2006,\nwas cancelled because Applicant took a leave of absence from her employment. The case was\ntransferred to me on November 17, 2006, due to caseload considerations, and I rescheduled the\nhearing for January 8, 2007, at which the parties appeared as scheduled. The government submitted\nten exhibits (Gx. 1- 10) that were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and\nintroduced three exhibits (Ax. A - C), which were admitted without objection. I left the record open\nafter the hearing to allow Applicant time to submit additional relevant information. Her 13-page\npost-hearing submission was timely received and admitted without objection as Ax. D. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on January 16, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged in SOR 1 that Applicant drank alcohol at times to excess between\nJune 2003 and September 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that in June 2003 she was charged with and convicted\nof DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that in March 2004 she was again charged with and convicted of DUI (SOR \u00b6\n1.c); and that in September 2004 she was charged with and convicted of DUI, and that the charge\nwas still pending trial as of the SOR issuance (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In response, Applicant admitted the\nallegations in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. She denied being arrested in March 2004, and claimed she was\narrested for an unsubstantiated violation of the terms of her sentence from her June 2003 conviction.\nUnder SOR 2, the government alleged Applicant deliberately falsified her response to\nquestion 16 of her SF 85P (arrests, charges, and/or convictions for any offense in the past seven\nyears) by omitting the two arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that she\ndeliberately falsified her answer to question 22 (debts currently more than 180 days past) by omitting\nfrom her answer several delinquent debts listed in SOR 3. (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant denied\nintentionally falsifying her answers to the SF 85P.\nUnder SOR 3, the government alleged Applicant owed approximately $19,900 for 16 unpaid\ndebts that have either been charged off as business losses or referred for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a -\n3.p).  Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.f, 3.g, 3.j, 3.l, 3.m, and 3.o.\n\n This account is the same as that listed in \u00b6 3.j. Accordingly, I find for the Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 3.j.\n2\n Tr., 46;\n3\n Tr., 79.\n4\n Tr., 81 - 82.\n5\n Gx. 2 - 4; Gx. 7; Gx. 8.\n6\n Gx. 7.\n7\n3\nUnder SOR 4, the government alleged as criminal conduct, Applicant\u2019s falsifications listed\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, insofar as her answers may violate 18 U.S.C. 1001 (SOR \u00b6 4.a); and\nApplicant\u2019s three DUI arrests and convictions listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c (SOR \u00b6 4.b).\nHer admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the transcript and\nexhibits, I make the following additional findings of relevant fact:\nApplicant is 25 years old and has worked since January 2001 for a health care and medical\ninsurance company contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for TriCare, the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military personnel and their families.\nShe is also a single mother of a four-year-old child. \nApplicant attended college for one year in 1999. While in school, she received several\nunsolicited credit cards, which she used to supplement funding her parents gave her occasionally.\nShe soon became overextended in her use of personal credit and was unable to repay those accounts\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.e, 3.g, 3.m, and 3.o) because she could only afford rent, groceries, and other\nnecessities. After she left school and was supporting herself, she continued to accumulate unpaid\ndebt through other sources, such as retail stores (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.f), and through unpaid cable\ntelevision, internet service, residential telephone and cell phone accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d, 3.h,  3.i, 3.k,\n2\nand 3.p).  Of these, Applicant claimed she paid the delinquent phone bill listed in SOR \u00b6 3.d,  and\n3\n4\nthat the phone bill listed in SOR 3.i was resolved when the phone company kept her deposit after\nshe moved.  Applicant also failed to repay a cash advance company in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 3.l), and became\n5\ndelinquent on her car insurance payments (SOR \u00b6 3.m).6\nThe aforementioned debts total approximately $10,000. The largest accounts past due are for\ncredit cards in the amounts of $1,738 (SOR \u00b6 3.a), $1,222 (SOR \u00b6 3.g), and $2,685 (SOR \u00b6 3.m).\nApplicant has not paid or taken any verifiable actions to resolve any of her delinquent accounts. In\na written statement given to a government investigator in April 2005, Applicant represented she had\nplans to pay her debts off through a credit counseling service, but she failed to follow through on her\nplans.7\nSometime in 2000, Applicant was involved in a serious car accident. Her insurance company\ndetermined her car to be a total loss. However, by the time a determination of liabilities was\n\n Applicant testified she was held partially responsible for the accident.\n8\n Tr., 37 - 39, 77. Ax.

The insurance company has relied on the presence of the mechanic\u2019s lien\nas justification for not paying on Applicant\u2019s claim. The result has been that the credit union that\nfinanced the car loan has, since 2001, been looking to Applicant for the $9,712 due on the loan (SOR\n\u00b6 3.c). Applicant has disputed this debt, but does not have the resources to resolve it.9\nOn February 2, 2005, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) that showed\na positive net cash flow each month of about $1,879; however, at hearing she claimed she does not\nhave much money left over each month, and does not know why. She has a negative balance in her\nchecking account and nothing in her savings account.10\nOn June 27, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence\n(DUI) of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She and some friends had been at a club in another city and Applicant\nhad several mixed drinks. This was not the first time Applicant had driven after drinking alcohol.\nShe recalls her blood alcohol content (BAC) was between .12% and .14% when she was arrested.\nThe legal limit in her state at the time was .08%. She was found guilty, sentenced to four days in jail,\nfined nearly $1,500, and her driver\u2019s license was restricted. She was also ordered to attend a driver\nalcohol safety class and undergo 90 days of alcohol counseling. \nIn March 2004, Applicant was arrested for failing to attend her driver safety class; however,\nthis was quickly resolved because the paperwork that transferred supervision of her sentence from\nthe jurisdiction where she was arrested to where she lived and would attend the class was a day late.\nThis charge is erroneously reflected in Gx. 9 as another DUI charge.11\nOn September 4, 2004, Applicant was again arrested and charged with DUI. The charge was\npending as of the end of her background investigation. At hearing, Applicant testified she was\nconvicted of this DUI and received a sentence similar to that from her earlier conviction. She also\ntestified she is still on probation from the second conviction, that her license was suspended, and she\nwas ordered to abstain from alcohol. She admitted she still drank despite the court order, and that\nshe was last intoxicated on Christmas Eve 2006. Applicant admitted that she drank with friends as\noften as every weekend, frequently to the point of intoxication, and she disclosed that she has driven\nat times since her most recent conviction, despite having a suspended driver\u2019s license.12\nOn September 17, 2004, Applicant submitted her SF-85P. In response to question 16 (arrests,\ncharges, and/or convictions in the last seven years), she disclosed her June 2003 DUI arrest and\nconviction, but did not disclose her DUI arrest from the week before she completed the\nquestionnaire. In response to the SOR \u00b6 2.a, she denied intentionally falsifying her answer to this\nquestion. At hearing she testified that she knew the charge was pending, but thought she only had\n\n Answer to SOR; Gx. 1; Tr., 49 - 51.\n13\n SOR 2.b alleged she deliberately falsified question \u201c22. Your Financial Record.\u201d In the SF 85P submitted\n14\nas Gx. 1 in support of this allegation, this question is number 20. Neither party has addressed this discrepancy, and I\nconclude from all of the available information about this allegation that the reference in SOR 2.b is a typographical error.\n Answer to SOR; Gx. 1; Tr., 51.\n15\n Directive, Enclosure 2.\n16\n Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to show that a memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy\n17\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved\nusing the provisions of the Directive rather than, as originally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel\nSecurity Program, as amended (Regulation). Applicant did not object and I granted the motion. (Tr., 11) Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP102.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases.\n Also, Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions\n18\nand mitigating conditions associated with each guideline. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication\nprocedures contained in the Directive. (Regulation, C8.2.1)\n Directive, 6.3.\n19\n5\nto disclose convictions.  In response to question 20 (debts currently more than 180 days\n13\ndelinquent),  she disclosed only her $9,000 debt to the credit union stemming from her car accident\n14\nin 2000, discussed above. She did not disclose any of her other credit card or other personal debts,\ndiscussed above, which she knew to be more than 180 days past due. In response to SOR \u00b6 2.b,\nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying her answer to this question, and at hearing testified that she\nknew by listing the largest of her debts the government would find out about the others.15\nApplicant\u2019s friends and co-workers speak highly of her willingness to work hard and help\nothers. She has volunteered for projects to help the homeless and has been active in community\nefforts to stop violence in her hometown. Applicant enjoys a good reputation at work as an affable\nand professional worker who is good at her job.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n16\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information.  Each trustworthiness determination must\n17\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under\neach adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.  Each determination\n18\nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and it must reflect the adjudication process outlined in the Directive at\n19\n\n \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n20\nconcept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should\nconsider the following factors:\n \nE2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n \nE2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;\n \nE2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n \nE2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n \nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence;\u201d\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). See also, Regulation, C6.1.1.1 (\u201cThe standard\n21\nthat must be met for...assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty,\nreliability, and trustworthiness are such that...assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security.\u201d)  \n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n22\n See Egan; Directive, E2.2.2.\n23\n6\nSection E2.2.1.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\n20\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance\ngoverning the grant or denial of access to sensitive information.\nTrustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest  for an applicant to receive or continue to have access to sensitive\n21\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the burden then\nshifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. As with security\nclearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an applicant bears a heavy burden of\n22\npersuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each\napplicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect\nsensitive information pertaining to the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent\nwith the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for access in favor of the government.23\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, an applicant who is financially overextended\nthrough delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of engaging in\n\n Directive, E2.A6.1.1.\n24\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;\n25\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n26\n Directive, E2.A7.1.1. \n27\n Directive, E2.A7.1.2.1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\n28\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use;\n E2.A7.1.2.5. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment;\n29\n7\nillegal acts to generate funds to resolve their fiscal difficulties.  Applicant incurred several debts\n24\nwhile she was in school and for several years after through her careless use of credit cards. After\nleaving school in 2000, she continued to accrue delinquent debts through her credit cards and\nthrough non-payment of accounts at stores and for various utilities. Ironically, her largest debt \u2013\n$9,712 to the company that financed the car she totaled in an accident (SOR \u00b6 3.c) \u2013 did not arise\nthrough her own mismanagement. However, her overall financial problems have kept her from being\nable to pay or otherwise resolve that debt. Further, although she has had a good job for the past six\nyears, she cannot explain why she has no money left over each month. Aside from the debt listed at\nSOR \u00b6 3.j, the government has presented sufficient information to support the allegations under this\nguideline. These facts warrant consideration of Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1  and DC\n25\n3.  \n26\nBy contrast, Applicant has failed to show that her financial problems are either not recent or\nthat they constitute an isolated circumstance in her background. Nor has she demonstrated that the\nfactors leading to her indebtedness are not likely to recur or that she has sought help through credit\ncounseling. Indeed, as noted above, she still has trouble managing her money and she lacks the\nresources to repay or meaningfully address her delinquencies. Aside from the debt stemming from\nthe car accident, none of her debts resulted from factors beyond her control, and she has not made\nany good-faith effort to repay these debts. Accordingly, none of the Guideline F mitigating\nconditions apply to these facts. On balance, I conclude Guideline F against the Applicant.\nAlcohol Consumption. The security concern about alcohol consumption, as expressed\nthrough Guideline G, is that excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  Such consumption may be\n27\npresented as alcohol-related incidents such as fighting, domestic violence, arrests for alcohol-related\ncrimes, and clinical diagnoses of alcoholism or alcohol dependence. Here, available information\nshows Applicant twice was convicted of DUI, that between June 2003 and September 2004, she\ndrank every weekend with friends, often to the point of intoxication, that she continued to consume\nalcohol in violation of her probation requirement that she abstain, and that she was intoxicated as\nrecently as December 2006. On these facts, Guideline G DC 1  and DC 5  must be considered.\n28\n29\nThere is not sufficient information in this record to warrant consideration of any of the listed\nmitigating conditions under Guideline G. Applicant\u2019s last documented alcohol-related incident\noccurred in 2004. Thus, were it not for Applicant\u2019s recent intoxication in violation of a court order,\n\n E2.A7.1.3.2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem;\n30\n Directive, E2.A5.1.1.\n31\n See note 14, supra.\n32\n Directive, E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\n33\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities;\n E2.A5.1.2.5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded\n34\nagreement made between the individual and the agency;\n Directive, E2.A10.1.1.\n35\n8\nMC 2  might apply. In short, Applicant failed to produce any information that would indicate her\n30\nalcohol use has or is likely to change. Therefore, it is also likely she will be involved in alcohol-\nrelated adverse conduct in the future, thus perpetuating the government\u2019s doubts about her judgment\nand reliability. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline G against the  Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, a security concern may arise if it is shown an\napplicant has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.  Here, the government questioned\n31\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness by alleging she deliberately falsified material facts on her SF 85P by\nlisting only one of her arrests in response to question 16 and only one of her debts in response to\nquestion 20.  Available information is sufficient to support these allegations. Applicant\u2019s\n32\nexplanation of her response to question 20 \u2013 that she intended to disclose her debts to the\ngovernment by listing her largest debt \u2013 might seem plausible were that the only such omission.\nHowever, taken together with the fact her response to question 16 omitted an arrest that had occurred\nonly a week earlier, the most reasonable conclusion to be drawn from all of the information bearing\non this issue is that Applicant intended, through her answers to these questions, to mislead the\ngovernment by minimizing the scope of her financial problems and her arrest record.\nAccordingly, Guideline E DC 2  must be considered. Additionally, in light of Applicant\u2019s\n33\ncontinued drinking in violation of the terms of her probation, and her decision to drive despite the\nfact her driver\u2019s license has been revoked as part of her most recent DUI conviction, I have also\nconsidered Guideline DC 5.  By contrast, Applicant failed to submit sufficient information in\n34\nresponse to the government\u2019s case that would support any of the Guideline E mitigating conditions.\nI conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.\nCriminal Conduct. The facts raised as security concerns about Applicant\u2019s drinking and her\ndeliberate false statements to the government also raise security concerns addressed in the Directive\nunder Guideline J. Specifically, a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  A person who is willing to disregard the law and risk\n35\nfines or incarceration may also be willing to disregard rules and regulations governing the protection\nof classified information. The criminal activity at issue may consist of a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses. Here, available information shows that Applicant has been twice convicted\nof DUI, and that she continues to break the law by violating her probation and driving without a\n\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n36\n  Directive, E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\n37\nformally charged; and E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\n See note 20, supra.\n38\n Directive, E2.2.3. \n39\n9\nlicense. Available information also shows she deliberately made false statements to the government\nthrough her responses in her SF 85P. It is against federal criminal law and punishable by fines and/or\nimprisonment to knowing and wilfully make a false statement or representation to any agency of the\nU.S. government concerning a matter within its jurisdiction.  Applicant signed her SF 85P directly\n36\nbelow an advisement to that effect, thereby demonstrating she was aware of the consequences of her\nfalse statements. All of the foregoing requires consideration of Guideline J DC 1 and DC 2.  By\n37\ncontrast, there is no information available that would support consideration of any of the Guideline\nJ mitigating conditions. Her criminal conduct is recent, it is not isolated, and, in view of the fact\nApplicant\u2019s conduct includes knowing violation of the terms of her probation, she cannot claim she\nis rehabilitated. I conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.\nWhole Person. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have also considered the adjudicative\nprocess factors collectively referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  As discussed above,\n38\nApplicant has not demonstrated her criminal conduct, her drinking, and her financial problems will\nnot recur. The overriding security concern here is the lack of information showing rehabilitation or\nchanged circumstances that would resolve the government\u2019s concerns based on these facts.\nApplicant is a smart, hard-working person, and her friends and associates speak highly of her.\nHowever, their recommendations carry diminished weight in that none of their remarks demonstrated\nany firsthand knowledge of the adverse information in Applicant\u2019s background. \nA fair and commonsense assessment  of the entire record before me shows the government\n39\nproperly expressed reasonable doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a sensitive position. The\nSOR was based on sufficient, reliable information about Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol use, her\nalcohol-related criminal conduct, her deliberate false statements to the government, and her financial\nproblems. Such issues bear directly on an applicant\u2019s ability and willingness to exercise the requisite\ngood judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its sensitive\ninformation. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST THE APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.i:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.j:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.k:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.l:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.m:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.n:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.o:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.p:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for assignment to a\nsensitive position.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT In her SOR response, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, and 1.w. She denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.h, 1.j - 1.v, and 1.x -1.y. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 62- year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who is seeking a position of public trust. She was married for 44 years but was recently widowed. She 3 has a 42-year-old son, and two nine-year-old granddaughters. She is an enrollment specialist and 4 Tr. at 16-17. 5 Gov 2 at 8. 6 Tr. at 17-19. 7 Tr. at 29; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2. 8 Tr. at 30; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 2. 9 Tr. at 32; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 2. 10 Tr. at 31. 11 Gov 2 at 5. 12 Tr. at 30; Gov 2. 13 4 has worked for her current employer since July 2003.

Each case was dismissed as a result of failure to make payments. The SOR alleged\napproximately $34,480 in delinquent debt. Several accounts are resolved but over $21,000 in\ndelinquent debt remains with no plan in place to resolve the debts. Although Applicant expects to\npay her debt from money she expects to receive from her late husband's estate, legal proceedings are\npending and the outcome is uncertain. Applicant's current monthly expenses exceed her monthly\nincome.  Her financial situation is poor and it is unlikely that her financial situation will be stabilized\nin the near future. The trustworthiness concern is not mitigated under financial considerations.\nAssignment to a sensitive position is denied.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \"Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\" dated November 19, 2004.\n AE B is a one page letter from the US Department of Justice, dated September 25, 2007, pertaining to debt\n2\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n; AE C is a one page statement pertaining to the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.g; and AE D is a three page\nstatement from the attorney handling the Applicant's interests in her late husband's estate, dated September 25, 2007. \n Tr. at 5; Gov 1. \n3\n Tr. at 16; 25, 27.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn July 21, 2003, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\"); and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\napproved December 29, 2005 and effective September 1, 2006.  On April 26, 2007, DOHA issued\n1\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in\nessence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.\nIn a sworn statement notarized on May 15, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another\nadministrative judge on July 23, 2007 but was transferred to me on August 8, 2007.  A Notice of\nHearing was issued on August 8, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 30, 2007.  The hearing was\nheld as scheduled. The government offered seven exhibits which were admitted as Government\n(Gov) Exhibits 1-7 without objection.  Applicant offered one exhibit that was admitted as Applicant\nExhibit (AE) A without objection.  The record was held open until September 13, 2007, to allow\nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documents.  On September 13, 2007, Applicant\nrequested additional time to submit additional documents. An extension was granted until September\n21, 2007. Applicant did not respond and requested an additional extension until September 25, 2007.\nOn that date, she submitted three documents that were marked and admitted as AE B-D without\nobjection.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 12, 2007.  \n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, and 1.w.\nShe denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.h, 1.j - 1.v, and 1.x -1.y. Applicant\u2019s admissions are\nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 62- year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who\nis seeking a position of public trust.  She was married for 44 years but was recently widowed. She\n3\nhas a  42-year-old son, and two nine-year-old granddaughters.  She is an enrollment specialist and\n4\n\n Tr. at 16-17.\n5\n Gov 2 at 8.\n6\n Tr. at 17-19.\n7\n Tr. at 29; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2.\n8\n Tr. at 30; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 2. \n9\n Tr. at 32; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 2. \n10\n Tr. at 31.\n11\n Gov 2 at 5. \n12\n Tr. at 30; Gov 2. \n13\n4\nhas worked for her current employer since July 2003.  From January 1988 to March 2002, she\n5\nworked for another company. She lost her job due to corporate downsizing. When she departed, she\nreceived $25,000 from the company.  Aside from a few seasonal part-time jobs, Applicant was\n6\nunemployed between March 2002 to July 2003.   \n7\nIn May 2001, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Her case was dismissed in\nDecember 2001 for failure to make payments.   In January 2002, she again filed for Chapter 13\n8\nbankruptcy.  Her case was dismissed in September 2003 for failure to make payments.  In September\n9\n2003, she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2004 for failure\nto make payments.10\nApplicant filed for bankruptcy because she could not pay the monthly bills with her income\nand the money her husband gave her each month. Her husband gave her $1,000 a month to apply\ntowards the household expenses.  Applicant admits that she incurred a lot of credit card debt. In a\n11\nsigned, sworn, statement, dated December 22, 2006, she states, \nThe consumer credit card debts were mine. I spoiled our son and our granddaughter\nand spent too much money on them. My income combined with the $1,000 monthly\nallowance my spouse provided would not cover our monthly debts and obligations.12\nApplicant filed for bankruptcy as a sole individual each time she filed. Her husband was\nabusive and she was afraid of him so she did not include his name on the bankruptcy petitions.  His\nincome was nonetheless used to determine the amount of monthly payments Applicant was required\nto make under the Chapter 13 plan.  She states that she was unable to keep up with payments based\non her income and the money her spouse gave her for monthly expenses.   \n13\n \nSchedule I, Current Income of Individual Debtors, in Applicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed\nin 2003, indicates that Applicant's net monthly income was $1,571.  Her husband's net monthly\nincome was $1,083. They had a combined net monthly income of $2,654. Schedule J, Current\nExpenditure of Individual Debtors, lists total monthly expenses of $2,004, leaving $650 left over\n\n Gov 5 at 20-21.\n14\n Gov 5 at 6.\n15\n Tr. at 21, Gov 2.\n16\n AE A. \n17\n Tr. at 22; Gov 2. \n18\n Tr. at 23. \n19\n AE D.\n20\nGov 1. \n21\n Gov 4, Schedule F.\n22\n5\nafter expenses.   Applicant received $1,000 from her husband to apply towards the monthly\n14\nexpenses. Combined with her income, she had approximately $2,571 to pay the bills. After paying\nthe monthly expenses, this would leave her approximately $567 each month.\nOn July 9, 2004, Applicant completed a personal financial statement which listed her net\nmonthly income as $1,581.  Her husband's net monthly income is listed as $1,440.  Their combined\nnet monthly income was $3,021.44.  Their total monthly expenses were $2,286, leaving a net\nremainder of $785.   This did not include payments to her creditors.\n15\nShortly after the third Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2004, Applicant's house\nwas foreclosed and sold at auction to a realtor. She and her husband rented the house from the realtor\nuntil April 2006. The realtor notified them he intended to put the house on the market.  Applicant\nleft her husband on April 17, 2006.  She decided to leave because her husband's abusive behavior\nwas affecting her nine-year-old granddaughter.  About two weeks later on May 2, 2006, Applicant's\n16\nhusband shot himself in the head.  He died on May 5, 2006.  The day before he shot himself, he\n17\nchanged the beneficiary on his life insurance policy and his retirement account to his\ngranddaughters.   \n18\nApplicant retained a lawyer and filed a claim for payment of her husband's life insurance\nproceeds, and her husband's retirement system funds.  She anticipates getting approximately $15,000\nin life insurance and $42,000 from his retirement but her lawyers have advised her there is a\npossibility she may only get $37,000.   Her attorney indicates that a claim has been filed for the\n19\nsame funds by the grandchildren. It will take several months for the court to reach a decision.   \n20\nOn September 10, 2004, Applicant completed a public trust position application (SF 85-P).21\nA subsequent background investigation revealed the following accounts were listed in her 2003\nbankruptcy filing:  a $1,236 account (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $1,581 debt owed to an insurance company\n22\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e;); a $4,300 delinquent account (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a $2,880 delinquent loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a $260\nconsumer loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.h); a $3,000 department store credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.i); a\n$500 credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.j); a $666 credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a $1,500 account\n(SOR \u00b6 1.l); a $762 telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.m); a $10,000 delinquent student loan account\n\n Id. at 14 - 17.  \n23\n Tr. at 51-52; Gov 2 at 8. \n24\n Gov 5.\n25\n Id. \n26\n AE B.\n27\n AE C. \n28\n Tr. at 34-35, 42-44, 53, 57-60.\n29\n See Gov 4, Schedule F. \n30\n Tr. at 36, 54.\n31\n Tr. at 40, 45, 48, 55.\n32\n Tr. at 49; Gov 2 at 7-8.\n33\n6\n(SOR \u00b6 1.n); a $350 delinquent telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.o); a $550 delinquent cell phone account\n(SOR \u00b6 1.p); a $467 delinquent charged off credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.r).23\nIn addition to the debts listed in the bankruptcy, Applicant had a judgment entered against\nher for unpaid rent in December 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.q).  A credit report dated February 28, 2007,\n24\n25\nrevealed additional delinquent debts incurred after the last Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed.\nThe debts include a $441 delinquent cell phone account placed for collection in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6\n1.s), a $92 cell phone account charged off in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.t); a $964 cell phone account, placed\nfor collection in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.u); a $714 account  placed for collection in August 2006 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.v); a $311 cell phone account, placed for collection in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.w); a $531\naccount charged off in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.x); and a $714 credit card account charged off in\nJanuary 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.y).26\nThe $10,000 student loan account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n is resolved.  Applicant paid her\nstudent loan in full on December 29, 2005.  The obligation for her husband's student loan was closed\ndue to his death.   Applicant also provided proof that $2,880 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was paid in\n27\nfull.28\nDuring the hearing, Applicant denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.r,\n1.u, 1.v, 1.x, and 1.y because she does not recognize them.  The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e,\n29\n1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.r were listed included in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was filed in 2003.   She\n30\nadmits to owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.s, but claims the balances are not that high.31\nShe claims the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.m, 1,o and 1.t are paid in full.  The debt alleged in\n32\nSOR \u00b6 1.p is a cell phone account she took out in her name for a son's friend. He never paid the bill.33\nShe claims her former landlord has no intentions of collecting the $2,661 judgment entered against\n\n Tr. at 51-53.\n34\n Tr. at 69-70; Gov 2 at 6 and 8.  \n35\n Tr. at 22, 25.\n36\n Tr. at 24.\n37\n Tr. at 60-61. 72-74.\n38\n Tr. at 63. \n39\n Tr. at 64-69. \n40\n Tr. at 69-70. \n41\n Tr. at 72. \n42\n Tr. at 67, 79. \n43\n7\nher for unpaid rent (SOR \u00b6 1.q).   No additional documentation was provided to verify her assertions\n34\nregarding the debts in this paragraph. \nIn 2005, Applicant's wages were garnished by the IRS.  She forgot to include as income on\nher 2003 federal income tax return the $25,000 severance pay she received when she was laid off.\nThe balance due was approximately $7,000 to $8,000.  Her wages were originally garnished $250\nper pay period.  After her husband passed away, she requested the garnishment be reduced to $25\nper pay period. She claims to have paid $3,847 towards this debt.35\nApplicant intends to start resolving her remaining delinquent accounts when the issues\ndealing with her late husband's life insurance policies and retirement accounts are resolved.  She\n36\nadmits that her credit is \"a mess\" at the moment.  She currently supports her grand-daughter and her\n37\ngrand-daughter's 11-year-old half brother. Both currently live with her. Her son lives with her\nperiodically. He is unemployed and does not help with expenses. He intends to get a job at some\npoint.38\nApplicant's current net monthly income is approximately $1,777.  Her monthly expenses\n39\ninclude  rent: $728; groceries: $200; utilities: $275; car: $425; and medical expenses: $135. Her IRS\ngarnishment is approximately $50 per month ($25 per paycheck).  Her monthly expenses total\n40\napproximately $1,813. Her delinquent debt payments are not included in this figure. \nApplicant has never attended financial counseling.  She considered filing for bankruptcy\n41\nunder chapter 7 but claims her attorneys advised her against it.   She has no other credit card\n42\naccounts and is not aware of any other delinquent debts.   She did not provide information\n43\npertaining to her work performance.\nPOLICIES\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n44\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n45\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n46\n Id.\n47\n Id.\n48\n8\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n44\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.45\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n46\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n47\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n48\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n49\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n50\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n51\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n52\n9\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n49\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n50\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n51\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n52\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nand Guideline E - Personal Conduct. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations),\nand \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio and/or other financial\nanalysis) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has had difficulty meeting her financial obligations\nsince 2001 when she filed her first bankruptcy. While she has made some progress, approximately\n$21,680 in delinquent debts remain unresolved. Her monthly debts are currently higher than her\nmonthly income. Her financial situation is poor. FC MC \u00b6 19(e) applies because even though\nApplicant claims her husband only provided her a limited amount each month for expenses, it appears\nthat it was sufficient to pay the monthly living expenses. A large part of her financial problems were\ncaused due to excessive credit card expenses which she could not afford. She admits to spending too\nmuch money on her son and granddaughter. \nApplicant has the opportunity to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns. Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment) does not apply.  Applicant\ncurrently has numerous unresolved delinquent accounts.  She has had continuous financial problems\nover the past six years.  Her monthly expenses are approximately $36 more than her monthly income.\nHer financial situation remains precarious.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies, in part. Applicant was unemployed for 16 months between March 2002 and July 2003. This\nadversely affected her financial situation. However, she received approximately $25,000 in severance\n\n10\npay when she left her previous employer which could have helped with the loss of income during that\nperiod. Her separation from her husband in May 2006, his suicide, and his decision to change the\nbeneficiary on his life insurance and retirement accounts prior to his suicide is factor that is beyond\nher control. Although she is seeking to obtain some of the benefits through legal proceedings, the\nlegal proceedings are pending. It is uncertain that any money received would improve her financial\nsituation over the long term.  Her irresponsible financial spending habits existed for several years\nprior to her husband's untimely death.  She admits that she incurred a lot of credit card debt by\nspending more than she could afford. Her current expenses exceed her current income and she has\nnot presented sufficient information as to the initial steps she is taking to manage her financial\nsituation. Although Applicant experienced conditions that were beyond her control that impacted her\nfinancial situation, her track record of financial irresponsibility contributed to her financial situation\nsince at least 2001. Her decision to use her credit card to purchase items for family members that she\ncould not afford was within her control. For these reasons, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.\nApplicant has not attended any formal financial counseling.  She currently supports  her 42-year-old\nson, her nine-year-old granddaughter and her granddaughter's 11-year-old half brother.  Her monthly\nexpenses exceed her monthly income.  With the added burden of supporting an unemployed adult son\nand two young children, it does not appear that her financial problems will be resolved in the near\nfuture. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.n.  However, the remaining\ndelinquent accounts remain unpaid. Applicant attempted to resolve her financial situation by filing\nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy on three occasions.  Filing for bankruptcy is a legally permissible way to\nresolve one's accounts.  She was unable to follow through with her repayment plans. Although\nApplicant intends to resolve her delinquent accounts if she succeeds in her claim filed against her late\nhusband's estate, a promise to pay one's debts in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the\ntrustworthiness concerns under financial considerations. \nWhile it is acknowledged that Applicant has suffered a tremendous tragedy over the past year,\nher financial situation has been unstable for the past six years and is unlikely to improve in the future.\nApplicant has not met her burden of proof to mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness\nconcern. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. Applicant did not provide information about her work performance. While her\n\n11\nfinancial situation was aggravated by some factors beyond her control, a lot of the delinquent debts\nwere incurred due to a lack of discipline and budgeting. It is unlikely that Applicant's financial\nsituation will improve in the future. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

He did not\n\nItem 7 (Security Clearance Application, dated August 25, 2000).\n1\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application, dated August 25, 2004).\n2\n2\ninclude his use of marijuana or use while holding a security clearance on his two security clearance\napplications.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 10, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 28, 2006.  He admitted two and denied\ntwo of the allegations under Guideline H, and denied the allegations under Guideline E, providing\nan explanation for his actions.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu\nof a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 22, 2007.\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on March 14, 2007, and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.  His response was due April 13, 2007.  As of April 30, 2007, he had not\nresponded.  The case was assigned to me on April 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 48-year-old supervisory signal technician for a defense contractor.  He has\nworked for the same employer for over 27 years.  He is married with one step-daughter.  Applicant\nsubmitted two security clearance applications at different times, an electronic version in 2000,  and\n1\na paper version in 2004.2\nApplicant admitted he used marijuana until he completed high school in 1977.  He told\ninvestigators he started using marijuana in 1977 or 1978.  He admitted using marijuana only a few\ntimes since graduating from high school, averaging two or three times yearly.  He stated he is not a\nhabitual user.  He used marijuana in social situations or at concerts, and his consumption did not\nhave an effect on him.  He only took a puff when offered so he could be part of the event or group.\n\nItem 3, Response to SOR, dated August 28,2006, Item 6 (Investigation Testimonies, dated August 8, 2005,\n3\nto August 12, 2005).\nItem 3 (Response to SOR, dated August 28, 2006) at 4.\n4\nItem 5 (Interrogatories, dated July 7, 2006).\n5\nItem 3 (Response to SOR, dated August 28, 2006) at 4.\n6\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n8\n3\nHe did not use marijuana to satisfy a need for a drug or to get high.   He did not feel his use under\n3\nthe circumstances qualified as drug use, and his use does not show a consistent pattern.   Applicant\n4\nnoted he had indiscretions in the past on vacation or holidays that did not affect his work\nperformance or ability to deliver services to his customers.5\nHe told investigators that he purchased marijuana at least three times during his years of use.\nIn response to the SOR, he stated a friend brought food and beverage for a gathering and also had\nmarijuana to share.  He gave the friend some money to cover the food and beverage expenses, and\nhe told him to keep the change for the marijuana.  He did not take possession of the marijuana and\ndid not consider his actions as purchasing marijuana.6\nApplicant admitted he used marijuana on June 18, 2005, and July 10, 2005.  At the time,\nApplicant had a security clearance granted on March 3, 2001.  Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to question\n27 on both security clearance applications, asking if in the last seven years he illegally used any\ncontrolled substance.  He admitted using marijuana, a controlled substance, a few times a year from\n1977 until July 2005.  In 2000 and 2004, he had used marijuana in the last seven years.  Applicant\nalso answered \u201cNO\u201d to question 28 on the August 25, 2004, security clearance application asking\nif he ever used illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance.  He has held a security clearance\nsince 2001.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n7\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.8\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access\nto classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the\nDirective \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\n\nId.\n9\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.\n10\nSee Exec.

Dec. 19, 2002). \n14\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (App. Bd. Dec 13, 2000).\n15\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n16\n1993))\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n17\n4\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n9\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.10\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n11\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.12\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n13\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n14\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n15\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n16\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 17\n\n5\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement:  Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions\nregarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or\ndependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized\ndisclosure of classified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct:  A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana from 1977 until 2005, and providing money to friends who\npurchased marijuana  raises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (Any drug\nabuse), and DC E.A8.1.2.2 (Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution).  Applicant admitted using marijuana in high school in 1977 or1978.\nHe admitted using marijuana twice yearly since then.  He admitted using marijuana in June and July\n2005.  He also reimbursed friends who purchased the marijuana.  Even though he may not have\ndirectly paid for or purchased the marijuana, his actions in reimbursing the friend for the purchase of\nthe marijuana is the same as purchasing.  The government has established the disqualifying conditions.\nI have considered all of the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (MC) and determine none\napply.  He admits to last using marijuana in July 2005.  He used marijuana a few times a year since\n1977.  His use less than two years ago is recent, and his repeated use a few times a year shows his use\nwas not aberrational behavior or an isolated event.  MC E2.A8.1.3.1 (The drug involvement was not\nrecent), and MC E2.A8.1.3.2 (The drug abuse was an isolated or aberrational event) do not apply.\nWhile Applicant states he will not use drugs in the future, he has presented no information to\ndemonstrate any actions to show his statement is meaningful.  A statement not to use in the future is\nnot sufficient to establish a demonstrated intent.  He has not presented information to mitigate the\nsecurity concern for his use of drugs.\nThere is a security concern under Personal Conduct DC E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness.)  Deliberate action in providing false information with the intent to\ndeceive is the security concern.  When Applicant completed the security clearance application, he did\n\n6\nnot include his use of marijuana within the last seven years on either application.  He stated he could\nnot remember using marijuana for the seven years preceding his August 2000 application.  He also did\nnot note he used marijuana while holding a security clearance.  He did not believe his occasional use\nconstituted or warranted a positive response to the question.  Also, since he did not use drugs with any\nconsistency, and only on vacation or at social events, and his use of marijuana did not affect his job\nperformance, he did not feel his use warranted a positive response on the application.  He did not want\nhis employer to misinterpret any positive answer.  The two questions are direct and straight forward.\nThey ask if he ever used drugs in the last seven years or while holding a security clearance.  The\nquestions do not ask if he used marijuana under circumstances that affect his job performance or the\ntime and circumstances of his use of marijuana.  It is clear he understood the question since he did not\nwant his employer to misinterpret a positive response.  His failure to correctly respond was deliberate\nwith an intent to deceive the evaluators of his suitability for a security clearance.  I considered all the\nmitigating conditions under personal conduct and determine none apply.  I find against Applicant as\nto Personal Conduct.\nI have considered Applicant\u2019s conduct under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I considered\nApplicant used an illegal drug over a period of time and while holding a security clearance.  He then\ndeliberately lied about the use to deceive investigators.  He presented no information to mitigate or\nrefute his use of marijuana.  I find he is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are;\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He does\nnot intend to renew it. Also, he mitigated allegations of management and financial participation in\nhis mother\u2019s business in Lebanon by documenting his discontinuance of those activities. Applicant\nfailed to mitigate foreign influence security concerns arising because of his mother\u2019s citizenship and\nresidence as well as business in Lebanon. Also of concern are three siblings who are citizens of\nLebanon and either live there or are temporarily in the U.S. and are dependent on income from their\nmother. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 25, 2006, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received November 2, 2006, Applicant responded to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March\n26, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued April 6, 2007 for a hearing held on April 26, 2007. The\nGovernment introduced three exhibits and Applicant introduced 17 exhibits. All were accepted into\nevidence. The government requested that administrative notice (AN) be taken of nine official\ngovernment documents. Applicant testified on his behalf. The transcript was received on May 9,\n2007. The record was left open for submission of additional evidence until May 29, 2007, and\nextended until July 15, 2007. Two sets of document were submitted by Applicant on June 13, 2007,\nand July 12, 2007. Both were admitted without objection. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant has admitted all but one allegations under Foreign Influence (Guideline B), denied\nthe allegation under Foreign Preference (Guideline C), and admitted the allegations under Outside\nActivities (Guideline L). He offered explanatory information in his answer, at the hearing, and in his\npost-hearing submissions. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a\ncomplete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following\nadditional findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a principal defense contractor working since 2004\nas an engineer He holds B.S. and Master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering from a major state\nuniversity system and is studying for an M.B.A. He is the eldest child of a Polish-born father and a\nLebanese mother. In 1968 his father was a Polish merchant seaman on a Russian ship that was\n\n3\ndocked in Beirut, Lebanon, when he jumped ship, came ashore, and sought asylum at the U.S.\nembassy. It was granted and, during the time the asylum and immigration documents were being\nprocessed, he married Applicant\u2019s mother, a citizen of Lebanon, who was born in Jamaica. \nThe family emigrated to the U.S. in 1969 and Applicant was born in 1971. Several months\nafter his birth the family returned to Beirut to help care for his maternal grandparents. Three more\nchildren, two daughters and another son, were born to the family while they lived in Lebanon. Since\nLebanese citizenship could be acquired only through a Lebanese father the three younger children\nwere stateless. Their father acquired Polish citizenship for them, and they are also now Lebanese\ncitizens.\nThe family was in Lebanon when the sectarian war broke out in 1974. It was difficult to leave\nso the family remained. His mother began a business to support the family. Applicant attended a\nCatholic school in the Christian section of Beirut for 13 years during which time their home was\nbombed twice, once in the sectarian fighting and once by Syrian occupiers. Applicant\u2019s parents\nseparated, and his father returned to Poland after the Cold War ended in 1989. He died there in 2001.\nApplicant returned to the U.S. in 1989 at age 18 and enrolled in a university. He worked in the\ndefense industry during the first Gulf War for a foreign owned company doing business in the U.S.\nSince his father\u2019s death, Applicant is the only member of the family with U.S. citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s sisters are both Ph. D. candidates in universities in the U.S. and France. His\nbrother lives in Lebanon with his mother and owns a business based in Beirut doing business in\nenergy products in South Africa. He plans to move the business to another country. None of his\nsiblings are married. \nApplicant also obtained a Polish passport in 1995 at his father\u2019s request both as a gesture to\nhis father\u2019s homeland, and to lessen any likelihood of difficulties in entering Lebanon with a U.S.\npassport. He used it only once during a travel ban to Lebanon for U.S. citizens in the 1970's. It\nexpired in 2005 and he does not intend to renew it (Tr. 123). He visited Poland once at age seven to\nmeet his grandparents and again in 2001 for the funeral of his father. He has a strong preference for\nthe U.S. He used his U.S. passport for all travels the past 15 years including trips to Lebanon and\nSyria. He speaks Arabic but does not know Polish. \nApplicant\u2019s mother has a successful advising and training business based in Beirut with ten\nemployees. She began the business in 1989 advising and training companies in the middle east about\nnetworking, business management, and human resource practices. Many of her clients are charities\nand NGOs. Half of her clients are in Lebanon, and the other half are primarily in Dubai, and the\nUnited Arab Emirates. She intends to retire and dispose of the business in five years after her two\ndaughters have finished graduate school since she provides their financial support. She now lives\nhalf of the year in Jordan because of the difficulties in Lebanon caused most recently by the war in\n2006 between the forces of Hizballah and Israel. She visits the U.S. regularly once or twice a year\nto see Applicant and his family. She owns property in Lebanon valued at over $500,000. His brother\nalso visits the U.S. frequently. The family comes to the U.S. for holidays and christenings of\nApplicant\u2019s three young children. \nApplicant worked for his mother\u2019s company full time as a subcontractor between 2002 and\n2004. He organized a business in the U.S. which he used as a vehicle to provide support for her\n\n4\ncompany. During that period he traveled to Lebanon five or six times a year. The trips also took him\nto Jordan, Syria, Finland and France to visit clients and affiliates. He also continued to provide some\nservices to her company between 2004 and 2006 after he went to work for his employer. His income\nfrom his mother\u2019s company during that period was approximately $6,000. He also had certain\nfinancial authority for the business including a power of attorney which has been revoked since the\nhearing in this matter (Post-hearing submissions 1 and 2).\nApplicant has never held a security clearance, but his career opportunities are severely limited\nin his company without one. He is financially independent of other members of his family and they\nare independent of him. His annual salary is $130,000. He owns his own home and has  $200,000\nin equity. He has various savings and brokerage accounts valued at approximately $100,000\nincluding education accounts for his three children. \nApplicant knows the need to preserve U.S. technology. He loves his work, and is very proud\nof his U.S. education. He appreciates the responsibilities which he has been given. He is highly\nregarded by his company through their evaluations and by his supervisors in their letters of support.\nThey believe he has a bright future with the company (Exhs. C, D, H, and I) . \nLebanon is a country with a historic past that has had a functioning multi-party government\nthat have recognized diverse ethnic and religious groups giving them participation in the\ngovernment. It has long been known for its tolerance of divergent views. However, since 1975 it has\nbeen riven by civil wars, outside attacks on its territory, and occupation by Syria. The U.S. is\nsupportive of the government and works to help it enforce its laws and secure its borders. However,\nbecause of various private armies there is doubt as to whether the government of Lebanon has de\nfacto control over its own territory (AN 2, 3, and 4)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2 (a) Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order\nNo. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\n\n5\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2 (b) \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR: \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence\nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion (AG \u00b6 7a). Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of\nfamily members living abroad, the Government established a basis for concern over foreign\ninfluence. The Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which\nrefutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nBy virtue of the relationships of the foreign family members, Applicant\u2019s contacts, cannot\nbe deemed casual. Mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are located, or the\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual group or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8a). The other relevant MC is that the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,that he can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8b). While I believe Applicant could qualify under\nthat MC because of his long residency in the U.S. since age 18 thus having lived all his mature life\nin the U.S., his extended complex and internationalized family relationships pose a myriad of\nunanswered questions about possible pressures that could be brought to bear on him. While I have\nno concerns about Applicant or his relatives in view of their family history and present work, they\nlive in a troubled part of the world with many hostile groups. While their own specific community\nis not in question, they are surrounded by others such as terrorist organizations, occupiers, and\nwould-be occupiers who pose a threat to others in the area and could cause pressure to be brought\non him.. \nGuideline C: Foreign Preference \nThe applicable guidelines for Foreign Preference Guideline C provide that an individual who\nacts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States may be\n\n6\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States\n(AG \u00b6 9). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include the\npossession of a current foreign passport (AG \u00b6 10a 1). \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by a providing evidence that the passport has been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated. (AG \u00b6 11e) I\nconclude from the evidence submitted showing expiration of the passport and lack of intent to renew\nit by Applicant, that the allegation under Guideline C has been mitigated. \nGuideline L: Outside Activities \nThe applicable Guidelines cited in the SOR concerning Outside Activities-Guideline L\nprovides as disqualifying conditions (DC) involvement in certain types of outside employment or\nactivities if they pose a conflict with an individual\u2019s security responsibilities and could create an\nincreased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information (AG \u00b6 36). Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying include any service, whether compensated,\nvolunteer, or employment with a foreign country; any foreign national; or a representative of any\nforeign interest (AG \u00b6 37 a 1,2, and 3).\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC) include:  \n1 Evaluation of the outside employment or activity indicates that it\ndoes not pose a conflict with an individual\u2019s security responsibilities\nor with national security interests of the U.S.(AG \u00b6 38 a).\n2 The individual terminated the employment or discontinued the\nactivity upon being notified that it is in conflict with his or her\nsecurity responsibilities. (AG \u00b6 38 b).\nThe type of work done by Applicant for his mother and the work of her company is not of\na type to pose a conflict with his security responsibilities for his employer. He has terminated his\nlegal relationships in the U.S. with his mother\u2019s company. I conclude that he has successfully\nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline L. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is a person of substance who is well educated and ambitious. He has a responsible\nposition of trust, and is doing an excellent job for his company. He provided sincere and credible\ntestimony as to his relationship with his family, his motivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. He has\nestablished a successful life here building financial ties to the U.S. He has a strong financial stake\n\n7\nin the U.S. He has no deference to or loyalty to either Lebanon or Poland. However, the multitude\nof family connections and uncertainties in a tumultuous part of the world where possibilities exist\nto bring pressure on Applicant leads me to conclude that it is premature at this time to grant a\nclearance to him because of the potential for pressure or coercion.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant clearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l.

Applicant did not report this incident to his employer\u2019s security\nofficer until several weeks later as well.\nWe have examined Applicant\u2019s allegations of error in light of the record as a whole.\nApplicant has not met his \u201cheavy burden of persuasion\u201d that he was denied the due process rights\nsecured by the Directive.  ISCR Case No. 05-11641 at (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2007).  Specifically\nApplicant asserts the Judge relied unreasonably on uncharged misconduct.  The conduct in question\nhas to do with Applicant\u2019s failure timely to report adverse information.  The conduct is intimately\nlinked to the allegations in the SOR and was reasonably before the Judge.  \nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based upon substantial\nrecord evidence.  See Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.\u201d)  Applicant has not met his \u201cheavy burden of persuasion\u201d that the Judge\nacted in such a fashion as to cause a reasonable person to question his fairness, impartiality, or\nprofessionalism.  ISCR Case No. 05-04923 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2007).  Finally, viewed in the\nlight of the record as a whole, the Judge has articulated \u201ca satisfactory explanation for [his]\nconclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his adverse decision, both\nas to the intentional nature of Applicant\u2019s omission as well as the application of Guideline E and J\nmitigating conditions.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  The record\nsupports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d for him to have a clearance.  Decision at 11.  See Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n3\n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn B. Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nThomas R. Townsend, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s three criminal offenses between December 1990 and June 2003 represent a\npattern of criminal behavior that has not been mitigated. Applicant\u2019s personal conduct set forth in\nsubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. of the Statement of Reasons has not been mitigated either. Furthermore,\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for the delay in reporting the June 2003 offense to his facility security\nofficer are not reasonable or credible. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n AE E, a copy of the SOR and Applicant\u2019s answer was not admitted in evidence and returned to Applicant.\n1\n2\nOn April 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as reissued through Change 4\nthereto, dated April 20, 1999, and revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) dated September 1, 2006,\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons under criminal conduct\n(Guideline J) and personal conduct (Guideline E) why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied\nor revoked. Applicant provided his answer to DOHA on May 21, 2007, Applicant requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 23, 2007. On September 18, 2007, this case was set\nfor hearing on October 11, 2007. The government submitted sixteen exhibits (GE 1-16) and called\nthree witnesses. I also took official notice of the National Industrial Security Program Manual\n(NISPOM). Applicant submitted nine exhibits (AE A-I)  and elicited the testimony of four witnesses,\n1\nincluding Applicant. The transcript was received on October 24, 2007. On November 15, 2007,\nApplicant requested (by fax) 10 additional days to review the transcript because he did not receive\nhis copy until November 13, 2007. That request was granted. On November 26, 2007, Applicant\nsubmitted a list of proposed corrections to the transcript. Department Counsel reviewed the list and\ninterposed no objections. Applicant\u2019s proposed corrections are accepted. \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nGE 8, a certified results of interview, is one page in length. The second to the last paragraph\n(fourth paragraph from the top) of Government Exhibit (GE) 8 was deleted from the remainder of\nthe exhibit based on double hearsay from multiple sources. (Tr. 28) GE 8 was then admitted.\nGE 9, a report of investigation, is four pages in length. The following areas of page 2 were\ndeleted from the exhibit for double hearsay reasons: (1) the first paragraph beginning with \u201cSubject\nwas asked by this writer . . . \u201d; (2) the first sentence of paragraph five; (3) the 13  paragraph (last\nth\nparagraph on page 2). The remainder of the exhibit was admitted. \nGE 12, a probable cause affidavit, is two pages in length. Based on double hearsay, the\nfollowing sentence was removed from page 2 of the exhibit: The sentence appears at line 19,\nbeginning with the words: \u201cI met with . . . ,\u201d and ends on line 21 with the word \u201cstaggering.\u201d The\nremainder of the exhibit was admitted. \nI have taken official notice of certain portions of the National Industrial Security Program\nOperating Manual (NISPOM), including Section 3 addressing reporting requirements. In addition,\nI have taken official notice of a state supreme court decision (February 25, 1988), holding that in the\nsentencing phase of a criminal offense identified as \u201cleaving the scene of an accident that involved\npersonal injury,\u201d restitution to the victim cannot be a condition of a defendant\u2019s probation where\ndamages to the victim were not caused by defendant\u2019s leaving the scene of an accident. \n\n AE A is a long form traffic report dated June 21, 2003, and generated by the state trooper who also prepared\n2\nGE 12 (probable cause report). The report contains Applicant\u2019s current address. Certain areas of the exhibit were\nhighlighted by Applicant\u2019s counsel (Tr. 128). Those highlighted areas have been disregarded. \n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 44 years old and single. He has been employed as a hydraulics engineer at the\nsame location since 1988. In May 2006, he was promoted to a-level 5 engineer. \nIn December 1990, Applicant was at a Christmas party and had too much to drink. While\ndriving home in his car, he was stopped by the police for failing to stay in his driving lane. He failed\na breath test and was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) (subparagraph\n1.a.). A plea bargain reduced the DUI to a less serious offense of reckless driving. Applicant\u2019s\nsentence included court costs, community service and six months probation. He successfully\ncompleted all conditions of his sentence. Applicant maintains he reported the 1990 alcohol-related\nincident to his facility security officer (FSO) (Tr. 149).\nOn or about November 22, 2000, Applicant consumed three mixed drinks at a restaurant. He\nbegan to feel tired because he had also taken prescribed sinus medication earlier in the day. He was\non his way home when he decided to stop at his father\u2019s house. After turning onto the street where\nhis father lived, Applicant noticed his father\u2019s driveway was filled with cars. Applicant then decided\nto turn into a neighbor\u2019s driveway and rest for about an hour before driving home. The sheriff\u2019s\ndepartment awoke him and charged him with DUI (subparagraph 1.b.). Applicant pled guilty to the\nless serious offense of reckless driving and was sentenced to six months probation, court costs, 50\nhours community service and alcohol counseling. He successfully completed all conditions of his\nsentence, including counseling. The group sessions consisted of 15 group sessions in 15 weeks, and\n15 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. The counseling educated him on the effect of mixing\nalcohol with certain kinds of medication. There was also a general alcohol course he completed (Tr.\n148; GE 6). Applicant reported the November 2000, alcohol-related incident to his FSO (Tr. 150).\nAbout 10:00 p.m. on June 21, 2003 (Saturday), Applicant was driving his pickup truck from\na movie theater to his father\u2019s house who lives in Applicant\u2019s neighborhood. He is sure he had not\nbeen drinking during the day before the incident (Tr. 156). After spending between 15 and 30\nminutes at his father\u2019s house, Applicant departed for home. He observed two vehicles in front of\nhim, then turned his eyes away from the road to adjust his compact disc player located behind his\ndriver\u2019s seat. When he turned back around, he was too close to the vehicles and had no chance to\nstop. He struck the rear end of a pickup truck (middle vehicle) containing the two victims. \nThe probable cause report indicated no skid marks from Applicant\u2019s pickup truck (vehicle\none). The middle vehicle then struck the rear of a third vehicle, then the middle vehicle continued\nthrough the intersection and collided with a tree. (GE 12, AE A).  The impact of Applicant\u2019s vehicle\n2\nand the middle vehicle (occupied by the two victims) pushed the middle vehicle forward about 245\nfeet (GE 12). Applicant did not know how fast he was going and could have been traveling faster\nthan 35 to 40 miles per hour. (GE 5). The posted speed limit at the accident location was 35 miles\nper hour. \n\n Applicant did not file a complaint against the individuals who caused him to fear for his life (Tr. 214).\n3\n4\nThe impact of Applicant\u2019s pickup with the middle vehicle caused the air bags in Applicant\u2019s\npickup to deploy and knock off his glasses. After gathering his thoughts for a couple of minutes, he\nmade an attempt to walk toward the pickup truck he hit to check on the condition of the occupants.\nHow close he got to the pickup truck containing the victims is not clear. Applicant\u2019s May 2005\ninterview (GE 10) reflects he walked to the victims\u2019 vehicle and believed they were all right. In the\nsworn statement (GE 5) on January 23, 2007 and at the hearing, he walked toward the victim\u2019s\npickup truck, but noticed some neighborhood residents gathering at the accident scene. Applicant\nthought that two or three of the residents were brothers of the two victims (Tr. 155, 198). The record\nis silent as to how he discerned the relationship of these individuals to the victims. According to\nApplicant, an unknown number of residents among the gathering began to threaten him in various\nways, making him fear for his life (Tr. 155).  At least one person shoved him as he was returning to\n3\nhis truck to recover his eyeglasses (GE 5).\nFor some reason, the crowd that was following Applicant as he was returning to his pickup\ntruck to recover his eyeglasses, reversed course to the victims\u2019 truck, so, he decided to withdraw\nquickly from the scene. He walked about a mile to a wooded lot with no house. Still disoriented from\nthe collision, he sat by a tree and went to sleep about 11:00 p.m. (Tr. 157) At approximately 5:00 or\n6:00 a. m. the next morning (June 22, 2003, Sunday), Applicant awoke and walked to a friend\u2019s\nhouse where he called his lawyer. Then, Applicant\u2019s friend took Applicant to his father\u2019s house\nabout 10 a.m. Applicant spent the remainder of the day at his father\u2019s house. He also spent the day\nat his father\u2019s house on June 23 (Monday) and June 24, 2003 (Tuesday) (GE 5).\nAs noted in his sworn statement (GE 5), Applicant\u2019s attorney (during the period from June\n25, 2003 to September 16, 2003) called him at his father\u2019s house on Wednesday, June 25, 2003, and\ninformed Applicant that the attorney was scheduling June 30, 2003 as the date Applicant would\nsurrender to the police. A couple of days after June 25, 2003, the attorney told Applicant not to\nsurrender to the police, and that he would inform Applicant when the surrender date would be. When\nasked whether he tried to turn himself into the investigating officer (Tr. 159), Applicant read lines\n7 through 10 of the probable cause report (GE 12, generated by the state trooper who investigated\nthe crash), indicating that the state trooper could not accommodate the attorney\u2019s telephonic request\non June 25, 2003, to accept the surrender of Applicant since the trooper was still involved in the\ninvestigation and was going to turn his results over to the state attorney. In the next sentence of the\nreport, the trooper offered to allow Applicant to present his side of what happened in the crash. The\nreport reads:\n[Applicant\u2019s attorney] then advised [state trooper] (Applicant\u2019s attorney and\nApplicant) would be at [highway patrol station] on Monday (June 30, 2003) at 3:30\nP.M. He (Applicant\u2019s attorney) then ask that I (state trooper) not arrest his client\nbecause he has an important job at the space center to make sure [space ship] takes\noff on time. I (state trooper) then gave him (Applicant\u2019s attorney) my word. On\nMonday at 3:00 I (state trooper) received a call from [Applicant\u2019s attorney] advising\nthey would not make it due to car problems (GE 12).\n\n5\nOn Tuesday, July 1, 2003, the state trooper received a call that Applicant\u2019s attorney was\nwaiting for him at the police station. The trooper reported, \u201cI then hurried back to the station for the\nunscheduled meeting, to find that his client (Applicant) was not present and he (Applicant\u2019s attorney)\nhad no intention of letting him answer questions, not even about the crash investigation.\u201d (Id.) \nOn September 16, 2003, Applicant\u2019s attorney told Applicant by phone to turn himself in at\nthe police station (Tr. 161). On September 17, 2003, Applicant surrendered himself to the police. \nWhen asked why he did not report the incident in June 2003 to his FSO, Applicant replied:\nI didn\u2019t report it because in my eyes there was no adverse information to report. Not\nknowing all of [his attorney\u2019s] - - what all he was doing behind the scenes, and then\nthe fact that I couldn\u2019t turn myself in, I assumed and actually call me naive or\nwhatever that maybe there weren\u2019t going to be any charges in this accident. Because\nI acted in self-defense, you know, I throughout the whole thing until I received a\nphone call on the 16  [September] from [his attorney] that I needed to turn myself\nth\nin, I, again, was under or hopeful and praying that there would be no charges in this\ninstance. So based on that and the fact that I - - my attorney made provisions to turn\nmyself in and was turned away, there was no - - there was no adverse information as\nfar as an arrest report. (Tr. 160-161)\nApplicant reiterated his sentiments about hoping that he would not be charged. He held out\nthat hope until his attorney called him on September 16, 2003, to turn himself into the police the next\nday (Tr. 196).\nThe FSO prepared an adverse information report (GE 4) on September 24, 2003\n(subparagraph 2.b.), based on her meeting with Applicant in which he informed her of the leaving\nthe scene offense. She was required to generate this report pursuant to 1.302 of the National\nIndustrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (Tr. 59). The FSO also cited the defense\ncontractor provisions applicable at the time of the incident for reporting adverse information (Tr. 63;\nGE 16, page 19, AE I). At the meeting, Applicant supplied her with notes (GE 14, one page) he had\nprepared after he turned himself into the police on September 17, 2003 (Tr. 188). The one page\nexhibit indicates the offense he was charged with, his plea, and his next court date. (Id.) Although\nshe did not recall during the meeting whether she asked him when the offense occurred (Tr. 61), the\nadverse information report states he told the FSO he did not know when the offense took place (GE\n4). When asked why he could not identify the offense date, he stated he simply forgot as the date was\nnot a part of the notes (GE 14) he had given her (Tr. 162). She did not believe he was trying to hide\nanything (Tr. 167). I find his explanation for not providing the date of the accident to the FSO is not\ncredible for three reasons: (1) the seriousness of the accident; (2) the recency of the offense; and (3)\nthe series of events that purportedly took place after Applicant hit the middle vehicle, withdrew from\nthe scene, and slept in the wooded lot. \nSubparagraph 1.c. of the SOR alleges Applicant was charged with two counts of the leaving\nthe scene of an accident involving personal injury (third degree felonies) and two counts of reckless\ndriving (second degree misdemeanors). The allegation also reads that he was found guilty of the four\ncharges. The number of charges as well as the number of charges Applicant pled to is incorrect. On\nJuly 16, 2003, a capias was issued on the charge of one count of leaving the scene of an accident\n\n After reviewing Applicant\u2019s documentary submissions, including Internal Revenue Service (IRS) documents\n4\nand checking account information, the investigator concluded Applicant had been making his restitution payments\nthrough legitimate means (Tr. 121).\n6\ninvolving personal injury (AE C). A capias was also issued on one count of reckless driving (AE D).\nOn September 5, 2003, an information was filed citing June 21, 2003 as the date Applicant left the\nscene of an accident involving personal injury to two victims (AE D). On November 10, 2003,\nApplicant pled guilty to one count of leaving the scene offense involving personal injury, third\ndegree felony, and was sentenced on February 25, 2004. Apparently, the reckless driving charge was\ndismissed. He was sentenced to 15 weekends at the local county farm, required to pay court costs\nand fees totaling $284.00, ordered to provide restitution to the victims in the amount of $115,000.00,\nand placed on probation until February 24, 2009. \nSubparagraph 2.c. alleges that Applicant declined to provide a written financial statement to\nan investigator of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant told the investigator he\nearned about $84,000.00 in salary, and had about $70,000.00 in savings. He explained that he had\npaid all but $29,400.00 to both of the victims in the accident. His insurance company paid\n$15,000.00 to each victim. Applicant paid the victims $4,000.00 in June 2004 and $6,000.00 in July\n2004. Every month after July 2004, he paid $4,560.00 to the victims, and he had only the\naforementioned remainder to pay by the time of the OPM interview. After hearing figures about\nApplicant\u2019s earnings, his savings and his record of restitution payments, the investigator was\njustifiably interested in obtaining additional information. Applicant did not provide financial\nstatement and should have. On the other hand, he provided detailed information about his finances\nin his answers to interrogatories (GE 6) and his sworn statement (GE 7).  \n4\nThe facility site director testified that he has worked with Applicant for the last five years,\nand has found him to be reliable, well prepared, and a trustworthy engineer. The site director has\nseen Applicant\u2019s file, but does not specifically know why his file is being challenged. \nThe manager of launch vehicles stated at the hearing Applicant has worked for him since\nabout 1997. The manager considers that Applicant, in addition to being reliable and trustworthy, is\ndevoted to ensuring the project is completed on time and according to specifications. The manager\nlacks any knowledge of the reasons for the security hearing. \nA coworker, who is a mechanical engineer and Applicant\u2019s friend outside the workplace, has\nworked with Applicant for the past 20 years, although the coworker\u2019s job centers on project assembly\nwhereas Applicant\u2019s job is directed at a project\u2019s hydraulics. The coworker described Applicant and\nhimself as predictable, steady individuals. The coworker received Applicant\u2019s help in landscaping\nhis house. The friend was not really sure about the reasons for the hearing, but mentioned adverse\ninformation about an accident and restitution. \nApplicant testified he has not consumed alcohol since he was released from custody on his\nown recognizance on September 17, 2003. One reason he has remained abstinent is because no\nalcohol is a condition is of his current probation (Tr. 193).\nAs the finder of fact, I am responsible for weighing the circumstances of each case in order\nto find the most reasonable and credible set of facts. Toward that end, I can be believe all of a\n\n7\nwitness\u2019 testimony, some of his testimony or none of his testimony. Applicant repeatedly maintained\nhe did not report the accident to the FSO because he had not been arrested or charged. He even made\na point of his growing hope the charges would not be filed. The credibility of his arrest claim and\nhis no charge hopes is undermined by Applicant\u2019s age (40) at the time of the accident and the 15-year\nperiod in which he has held a security clearance. The credibility of both claims is also undermined\nby the information of GE 12 that raises a reasonable inference Applicant knew he was going to be\narrested, and a course of action appears to have been underway to delay the arrest. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nIn addition to creating doubt regarding a person\u2019s judgment and trustworthiness, criminal\nconduct raises questions about s person\u2019s ability to comply with laws. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nConduct that involves questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, may also raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to safeguard classified information. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n8\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nThe government has established a pattern of criminal behavior that falls within the scope of\nthe CC guideline. CC disqualifying condition (DC) 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) applies. In December 1990 and November 2000, Applicant was charged with two alcohol-\nrelated driving offenses. The fact that he pled guilty to lesser included offenses on both occasions\ndoes not eliminate the security significance of his underlying criminal conduct. \nOn June 21, 2003, Applicant rear ended a second vehicle that hit a third vehicle. After hitting\nthe third vehicle, the second vehicle continued travel until it hit a tree. On November 10, 2003,\nApplicant pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury. On February 25,\n2005, he was sentenced to supervised probation, which is scheduled to end in February 2009. He also\nwas required to pay $115,000.00 in restitution, which he completed in December 2005. The fact that\nApplicant was not obligated to make restitution under state law does not alter Applicant\u2019s\nresponsibility for the accident. \nThere are two mitigating conditions (MC) that may eliminate or dramatically reduce the\nsecurity concerns associated with Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct: CC MC 32.a. (so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment), and CC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nno limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community service). Though\nApplicant\u2019s sentencing was more than three years ago, the mere passage of time does not sufficiently\nmitigate the case due to the fact Applicant is not scheduled to be discharged from probation until\nFebruary 2009. He is aware that any violation of his probation could mean reinstatement of the\noriginal terms of his sentence. Second, based on my conclusion Applicant knew he was going to be\ncharged with a crime, he should have advised his FSO much earlier about the offense, rather than\nwait three months. Applicant\u2019s use of poor judgment renders CC MC 32.a. inapplicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. \nApplicant is entitled to limited mitigation under CC MC 32.d. based on the passage of time\nwithout subsequent criminal activity. Even though Applicant is still on probation, he has complied\nwith the terms of probation, including abstinence from alcohol. On the other hand, while he has paid\na large sum of money in restitution, his claims of remorse must be weighed and balanced against his\nhope from June 21, 2003 to at least September 16, 2003 that he essentially felt he had done nothing\nwrong to cause the accident. Applicant\u2019s two supervisors and one coworker provided an excellent\npicture of his good job performance, but they conveyed negligible insight into his behavior away\nfrom the job, specifically his criminal record. The evidence under CC MC 32.a. and CC MC 32.d.\nis insufficient to overcome the adverse evidence under CC DC 31.a.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nPC DC 16.c. (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, considered as\na whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\n\n9\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information) applies\nto subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. of the SOR. Besides the criminal implications of the leaving the scene\ninvolving personal injury (2.a.), the offense also constitutes questionable judgment under the PC\nguideline while supporting a negative whole person assessment. \nRegarding subparagraph 2.b., having caused a three-car accident, followed by the threatening\nbehavior and an assault Applicant claims that put him in fear for his life and forced him to withdraw\nfrom the scene to a vacant lot where he slept for part of the night, and certainly caused him\nconsternation in the week following the accident, I find no credible reason outside of PC DC 16.b.\n(deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to a security\nofficial) for Applicant to tell his FSO he could not recall when the June 21, 2003 accident occurred.\nThough he contends he forgot about the day of the offense, I conclude he did not want her to know\nwhen the offense occurred because of the suspicion that could be raised by three-month time frame\nbetween the accident and his disclosure. \nThe mitigating condition potentially available under the PC guideline for subparagraph 2.a.\nis PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) Even though the June\n2003 offense is dated, and may be unlikely to recur, Applicant\u2019s exercise of poor judgment between\nJune 21 and September 24, 2003, and his deliberate falsehood expressed to his FSO in September\n2003 makes PC MC 17.c. and 17.d. and PC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstanced, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior is unlikely to recur) inapplicable to these facts. The only mitigating condition available for\nsubparagraph 2.b. is PC 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment before being confronted with the facts). I am unable to apply this condition\nas Applicant\u2019s position continues to be that he simply forgot when the June 21, 2003 accident\noccurred. Subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. are resolved against Applicant. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s failure to provide a financial statement alleged under subparagraph\n3.c., I have weighed and balanced the agent\u2019s testimony with Applicant\u2019s testimony. Though\nApplicant did not provide a financial statement, he did provide the agent with practically all the\ndetails of the restitution schedule without the documentation. He also provided the second agent all\nthe documentation requested. Hence, I am unable to conclude Applicant\u2019s behavior comes within\nthe scope of PC DC 15.a. or b., or a disqualifying condition under 16. Subparagraph 2.c. is resolved\nin Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept\nIn all adjudications, the objective of the security clearance process is to decide whether a\nperson is eligible for a security clearance. This decision is based on a commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life using the general factors listed under the whole person model found in Enclosure 2\nof the Directive. The general factors that comprise the whole person are: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances of the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\n\n10\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. The record\nreflects a pattern of criminal conduct since December 1990. The record also shows the adverse\npersonal conduct set forth in subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. Applicant was 40 years old and had held\na security clearance for 15 years when he had the accident in June 2003. Relying on the advice of\ncounsel did not eliminate his duty to keep his FSO informed within a reasonable period of time of\nhis involvement in the accident. Having weighed the chronology of events ending with the\ninformation finally provided by Applicant to the FSO on September 24, 2003, I am unable to\nconclude that Applicant forgot the date of the accident. I have carefully evaluated Applicant\u2019s good\njob performance, his abstinence, and his compliance with terms of his probation, specifically the\nrestitution payments he completed in December 2005. Having carefully evaluated the entire record,\nApplicant has failed to overcome the criminal conduct allegations. Though he has also not met his\nultimate burden of persuasion under the personal conduct guideline, I find subparagraph 2.c. in his\nfavor. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J): AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. His criminal history spans an\neleven-year period and involves six alcohol-related charges. He still owes a significant number and\namount of delinquent debts that resulted from unemployment and underemployment. Although he\nhas stable employment and has resolved one debt and is paying off another, many of the debts\nremain unresolved. When he completed his security clearance application in August 2005, he did\nnot disclose all of his past incidents of criminal conduct or delinquent debts. He mitigated the\nsecurity concerns raised by his personal conduct, but failed to mitigate those concerns raised by his\ncriminal conduct and financial considerations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on August 25, 2005, in conjunction with his\nemployment with a defense contractor. On June 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by\nthe Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006, as to why DOHA could not make a\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge\nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. \nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on or about August 3, 2007, and elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was initially assigned to another administrative\njudge on August 22, 2007, and reassigned to me on October 5, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing on October 10, 2007, setting the case for hearing on October 25, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 11 into\nevidence without objections. Applicant testified and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through\nG into evidence without objections. The record was left open until November 9, 2007, to give\nApplicant additional time to submit documents. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nNovember 2, 2007. I received additional documents from Applicant on November 8 and 9, 2007,\nwhich I marked as AX H and I. Department Counsel had no objection to the documents and they\nwere admitted into the record on said date.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 40-years-old and single. In 1991, he obtained an associate\u2019s degree in tool\nengineering technology. Since January 2003, he has worked as an installation master planner for a\ndefense contractor, performing work for a military base. Before obtaining this position, he was\nunemployed for six months. Previously, he worked for a couple years as a project manager for a\nprivate company, and at various other jobs before that. In August 2005, he completed a security\nclearance application (SF-86). (GX 1). \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who oversees the planning project at a military base,\nApplicant impressed the chief of staff with his thorough and detailed master plan briefing in\nNovember 2006. (AX C & F). In June 2006, another supervisor complemented him for his excellent\nwork. (AX D). Applicant enjoys his job and is committed to it and his co-workers. (Tr. 78).\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nIn his Response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the eight criminal allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h. Those admissions are incorporated herein.\n\n3\nIn 1993 and 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with Passing Bad Checks, both\nmisdemeanors. He made restitution and the charges were dismissed. (Tr.17-18; 21).\nFrom 1994 through 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with six crimes involving\nalcohol. In February 1994, the court found him guilty of Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), a\nmisdemeanor. It sentenced him to three days in jail (suspended), and fined him $350 ($150\nsuspended). The court placed him on probation for six months, ordered him to attend an alcohol\nawareness class, and suspended his driver\u2019s license for 180 days. He was 27 years old. ( Tr. 18; 49).\nEight months later, in November 1994, the court found Applicant guilty of Physical Control\nwhile Under the Influence, a misdemeanor, sentenced him to 30 days in jail (suspended), and fined\nhim $500. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for 180 days. He again attended alcohol awareness\nclasses and lived in a residential treatment center for six days. At the time of the arrest, his license\nwas active, having been reinstated after the previous suspension. (Tr. 19-20; 51).\nIn August 1998, the court found Applicant guilty of Operating a Motor Vehicle While\nIntoxicated (OWI), a misdemeanor. It sentenced him to 180 days (suspended), fined him $25, and\nplaced him on probation for six months, during which time he attended alcohol awareness classes\ntwice a week for four weeks. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for 180 days. (Tr. 21).\nThe following year, in June 1999, Applicant fell asleep in his car after drinking at a bar and\nwas arrested in the parking lot. The court found him guilty of Public Intoxication, sentenced him to\n180 days in jail (160 suspended), and fined him $25. (Tr. 21-22; 53-54).\nTwo months later, in August 1999, the police arrested and charged Applicant with (1)\nDriving While Suspended, a felony; (2) Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated, a misdemeanor; (3)\nOperating a Motor Vehicle w/10% + by Wt. of Alc/blood, a misdemeanor; and (4) Operating While\nIntoxicated (OWI) with a prior OWI within five years, a felony. In May 2000, the court found him\nguilty on Count 4, and sentenced him to three years at a correctional center (all but 180 days\nsuspended), and fined him $100. He served 30 days in prison, 30 days in a felony diagnostic center,\nand 30 days in a minimum security facility. After his release, he was placed on probation for 30\nmonths and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 730 days (two years). The probation terminated\nin February 2003. (Tr. 22-23; 54-57).\nIn March 2004, the police arrested Applicant and charged him with a 3  OWI and Operating\nrd\nwith a BAC.10 or more (2 ), both misdemeanors. In September 2005, the court found him guilty of\nnd\nthe OWI and sentenced him to 65 days in jail, of which he served twelve. He was fined $1,186 and\nordered to complete a twelve-week alcohol assessment program, consisting of weekly two-hour\nmeetings. His driver\u2019s license was revoked for two years, although he was allowed to drive to work\nthe second year of probation. His license was reinstated in April 2007. (Tr. 23-24; 57-59).\nApplicant does not believe he has an alcohol problem. Although he has been evaluated for\nalcoholism, he never received a diagnosis of either alcohol abuse or dependence. Rather, he has a\npredisposition toward alcoholism. (Tr. 27; 62). Until the March 2004 arrest, none of the alcohol\neducation programs impacted his drinking habits. Now, he confines his drinking to Friday night and\n\n4\nSunday afternoon at a local bar. He usually consumes six to eight drinks and takes a taxi home after\ndrinking. (Tr. 60). Since this incident, he has asked his friends to help him \u201cnot re offend.\u201d (Tr. 26).\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nApplicant admitted the twenty-one factual allegations set forth in Subparagraphs 2.a through\n2.u of the SOR pertaining to financial considerations. \nThe twenty-one delinquent debts total $54,985. In July 2007, Applicant completed his\npayments to the IRS, owed on a $21,977 tax levy for the years of 1991, 1992 and 1993, through a\ngarnishment (\u00b6 2.a). (AX A). He is paying $400 per month on a $26,000 student loan through a\ngarnishment (\u00b6 2.b). (AX I, Tr. 33-34 ). He paid the $136 delinquent debt noted in \u00b6 2.c. (Tr. 34). He\ndisputed the $822 debt listed in \u00b6 2.e. He has not addressed or resolved the remaining 18 debts,\nwhich totals approximately $8,000 due to \u201cprocrastination.\u201d (Tr. 75). Although a friend gave him\nthe name of a credit counselor, he prefers to handle the problems himself. (Tr. 77).\nAccording to several credit bureau reports, Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2000 and\ncontinued to the present. (GX 9, 10 & 11). Applicant attributes some of the problems to a period of\nunemployment from July 2002 to January 2003, and underemployment periods before that. (GX 1;\nTr. 75). Prior to his current job, he was \u201cnot making very much money and living paycheck to\npaycheck.\u201d (Tr. 63). Now, his financial situation is improving. (Tr. 63). His current annual salary is\n$49,400. After taxes and the student loan garnishment are deducted, his net monthly income is about\n$2,000. His expenses are about $1,800, leaving a remainder of about $200 per month. (Tr. 70).\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nIn response to Question 23 (Your Police Record) on the SF-86, Applicant disclosed two\ncriminal charges: the August 1999 arrest (May 2000 conviction) alleged in \u00b6 1.g of the SOR, and the\nMarch 2004 charge alleged in \u00b6 1.h. He did not disclose the two 1994 alcohol related incidents listed\nin \u00b6 1.b and \u00b6 1.c, or the 1999 charge listed in \u00b6 1.f. He was not required to list the 1997 bad check\ncharge, as it occurred outside the seven-year limitation included in the question. \nIn response to Question 27 (Your Financial Record) on the SF-86, Applicant disclosed  the\nInternal Revenue Service\u2019s garnishment of $400 per month for a tax levy, but not the civil judgments\nentered in 1998 and 2002. \nUnder Question 28 (Your Financial Delinquencies), Applicant disclosed an outstanding\nautomobile loan that was delinquent more than 90 and 180 days. He did not list other delinquent\ndebts.\nApplicant knew his history contained many criminal and financial problems, but could not\nremember all of the details. He decided to mention the \u201cworst stuff.\u201d (Tr. 44). He did not attempt to\ndefraud or deceive the government by leaving off the other information because he knew it had\naccess to all his information. He was not aware of the Additional Comments section on the SF-86,\nthat provides space for further explanation or information. (Tr. 44-46; 72) \nPOLICIES\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to\n1\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App.\nBd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington\nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\n2\u201c\nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the\nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n5\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nGuidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n1\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce\nevidence and prove mitigation. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted\nby applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating\ncondition never shifts to the Government. 2\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\n\n6\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel\nbeing considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or\nimplied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Section 7 of Executive\nOrder 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial security clearance decision shall be\n\u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR:\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern with criminal conduct. \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature,\nit calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government raised a security\nconcern under a Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 31(a). Applicant was arrested and charged with criminal conduct,\nincluding two felonies, on eight separate occasions from 1993 to 2004.\nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. There are five Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under Guideline\n\u00b6 32. I considered two of them. Guideline \u00b6 32(a) provides mitigation when \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in March 2004. He was sentenced in September 2005,\nwhich included the revocation of his driver\u2019s license for 24 months. Given his criminal history and\nthe recent reinstatement of his license, about six months ago, sufficient time has not elapsed since\nthe last charge and this Guideline is not applicable.\n\n7\nGuideline \u00b6 32(d) requires a showing that \u201cthere is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation,\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d Applicant provided some evidence of rehabilitation. He submitted documents\nattesting to his good employment record and expressed remorse about his criminal history and\nfinancial problems. However, that evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient to outweigh the recency\nof the last charge or the number of charges and convictions over the last ten years. Nor did he\nprovide independent objective evidence to corroborate his assertions that similar alcohol related\nincidents will not recur in the future. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cThe\nfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all\nof which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit bureau reports, the Government raised\ndisqualifications under two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions: \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d. Guidelines \u00b6\n19(a) and \u00b6 19(c). Applicant has been unable to manage his debts from approximately 2000 to the\npresent.\nThe Government raised a security concern and the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. Six Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions can mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. After reviewing them, I conclude he presented evidence\nto support the limited application of two of them.\nGuideline \u00b6 20(b) applies when \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances.\u201d Applicant encountered periods of unemployment and underemployment that\naffected his level of income. However, there is no evidence that he contacted his creditors or sought\ncredit counseling during those times of limited income, which is the type of evidence necessary to\nestablish the second prong under this condition. \nAccording to the August 2007 credit report, Applicant disputed the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 2.e,\nwhich is sufficient evidence to apply Guideline \u00b6 20(e) to said debt. It states \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt, which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue.\u201d\nI considered Guidlines \u00b6 20(c) and \u00b6 20(d) and determined they do not apply. Applicant did\nnot obtain any counseling or produce sufficient evidence to prove that his problems are being\nresolved, which is necessary to trigger the application of \u00b6 20(c). It requires proof that \u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\n\n8\nproblem is being resolved or is under control. To the contrary, he has not contacted numerous\ncreditors to date. Although he paid the IRS and is repaying his student loan, both resolutions are the\nresult of garnishments, and not voluntary actions on his part. Thus, there is no proof that \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d as\nrequired under Guideline \u00b6 20(d). \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 15 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding personal conduct. \u201cConduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d\nOne Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly relevant and potentially\ndisqualifying in this case. Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d may raise a security concern. Applicant\u2019s SF-86 had incorrect answers to questions,\n23, 27 and 28. Applicant denied that he intentionally falsified his answers.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,\n2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant disclosed the two most recent and egregious criminal charges, a garnishment, and\none of his debts. He knew that his criminal history was significant and that his financial background\nincluded numerous delinquent debts. Because he could not remember all of the pertinent details, he\ndecided to alert the government to those issues he believed were most egregious. He knew the\ngovernment had access to all matters and had no intention to withhold information. Based on those\ndisclosures and others within the SF-86, I find his explanation for not listing all of the adverse\ninformation plausible. I find his presentation and demeanor while testifying on these issues lend\ncredibility to his denial of any intention to falsify information to the Government. Hence, the\nevidence does not establish deliberate falsification, as alleged in \u00b6 3.a, \u00b6 3.b and \u00b6 3.c.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s middle age, employment history, and success in his present position. I carefully observed\nhis demeanor while testifying, and listened to his candid disclosure about his history of criminal\nconduct and financial problems. I took into account the fact that the tax lien is resolved and he is\nrepaying his student loan (albeit through garnishments), and that he had limited income for several\nyears. However, the totality of the evidence in this record supports his disqualification from having\n\n9\naccess to classified information. He has been involved in eight criminal incidents, six involving\nalcohol, and several resulting in incarceration and the suspension of his driver\u2019s license for extended\nperiods of time. I am aware of his assertion that he does not have an alcohol problem, only a\npredisposition toward one. He acknowledges his procrastination in resolving an extensive list of\ndelinquent debts, including small ones. Although he appears to appreciate the gravity of these\nproblems and their effect on his career potential, he has not gained insight into his actions that\ncontinuously raise questions about his reliability and trustworthiness. Until he takes additional steps\nto insure that his life is not speckled with additional encounters with legal matters resulting from the\nconsumption of alcohol, and establishes a track record demonstrating financial responsibility, I\nsuspect similar events may recur in the future and are not likely to be tempered through the aging\nprocess alone. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all facts and circumstances\nin the context of the whole person, I concluded Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns\nraised by his criminal conduct and financial considerations. He mitigated those raised by personal\nconduct. The evidence leaves me with doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is concluded for him, and Guidelines J and F are found against him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.f through 2.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a to 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n\n10\n",

With little financial help from her husband and barely enough\nincome to support her family, she has been unable to make any meaningful inroads in paying her old\nacknowledged debts, many of which are apparently barred by applicable statutes of limitation. While\nshe submitted a debt consolidation proposal after the hearing, she failed to certify to counseling or\napprove the proposal in writing.   Although she is regarded as reliable and trustworthy by her friends\nand colleagues, her manifest reluctance to address her finances unconditionally precludes her from\nmitigating trustworthiness concerns at this time.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a trustworthiness determination clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 11, 2006, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on November 22, 2006, and was scheduled for hearing on December 6, 2006.  A\nhearing was convened on December 6, 2006, for the purpose of considering whether it would be\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s\napplication for a trustworthiness determination.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four\nexhibits.  Applicant relied on two witnesses (including herself) and one exhibit.  The transcript\n(R.T.) was received on December 21, 2006.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nAt hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  This\nproposed amendment entailed changing the reference from Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation\n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended to DoD\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  In support of its proposed amendment,\nDepartment Counsel relied on a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\n(Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\ndated November 19, 2004 that directs DOHA to utilize provisions of the Directive to resolve\ncontractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  The motion was granted.  As construed,\nthe procedural rules of the Directive will apply; while the substantive guidelines of the Regulation\n\n ADP III positions are not characterized as sensitive ones in DoD 5200.2-R (Appendix 10).  To make ADP III\n1\npositions subject to trustworthiness determinations, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense approved  use of the procedures in\nDoD Directive 5220.6 to resolve referred ADP III contractor cases for trustworthiness determinations. To apply the Directive\u2019s\nsubstantive guidelines to ADP III cases would require at least some covered nexus in the Directive itself, which neither Executive\nOrder 10865 nor the procedural guidance in the Directive addresses.   While not a perfect blend of procedural/substantive\nguidance, the combining of the Directive\u2019s procedures with the substantive guidelines in DoD 5200.2-R provides the best\navailable framework under the circumstances for ensuring due process to ADPIII applicants seeking trustworthiness\ndeterminations.\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nwill continue to control.   Although, in financial cases, there are no material differences in the\n1\ntreatment of financial considerations between the guidelines in the Directive and those in the\nRegulation. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant asked for leave to keep the record open to afford\nher the opportunity to supplement the record with accreditation documentation of her online medical\ntranscription school.  There being no objection from the Government, and good cause being shown,\nApplicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record.  The Government was, in turn, afforded\nseven days to respond.  Applicant timely requested an additional 14 days to document her\naccreditation certification, as well as credit counseling assistance.  This request for additional time\nwas not objected to and was granted for good cause demonstrated.  Applicant timely provided\nadditional documentation covering her account of her ongoing efforts to repair her finances, her\naccreditation certification, and her credit counseling arrangements, to which the Government did not\nobject.  Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions are accepted as Applicant\u2019s exhibits H through K. \nBecause the submitted credit counsel proposal was not executed by Applicant, on February\n5, 2007, I afforded her an additional ten days to provide an executed version and documented up-\nfront fees and payments she made to the credit counseling firm.  Department Counsel, in turn, was\ngranted seven days to respond to any submission.  Applicant did not supplement the record.\nInformed by Department Counsel that Applicant never received my February 5, 2007 at her\nnew address, I wrote to Applicant on February 27, 2007 at her new address with the same extended\nopportunity to provide an executed version of her credit counseling proposal and documented front\nfees and payments, and afforded her an additional ten days to provide the information.\nBy e-mail dated March 12, 2007, Applicant confirmed her receipt of my February 27, 2007\nletter and acknowledged she had not executed the credit counsel proposal or made any up-front\npayments to the counseling firm.  Applicant indicated she is still endeavoring to obtain account\ninformation on her creditors, and that her counseling contact can\u2019t do anything on the consolidation\nproposal until he obtains all of the original account numbers.  Applicant confirmed, too, that she has\nnot initiated any counseling with the debt counseling firm, presumably because she has not as yet\nformally enrolled in the program.\nAfter reviewing Applicant\u2019s response, I provided her an additional week to provide an\nexecuted debt consolidation plan and documentation of any fee and debt payments to the\nconsolidation firm.  Applicant did no provide any additional documentation or progress updates, and\n Department Counsel\u2019s efforts to telephonically reach her concerning any additional documents were\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nnot successful.  With this confirmation from Department Counsel, I closed the record on March 28,\n2007.\nApplicant waived her procedural entitlement to 15 days advance notice of the hearing.  She\nreceived the notice within 15 days of the hearing (R.T., at 15).\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts: She is\nalleged to have incurred 12 delinquent debts altogether (with several charged off before 2002), which\nexceed $12,000.00 in total.  For her response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted most of her debt-\nrelated allegations, and provided explanations about several of her debts.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 37-year-old claims associate of a defense contractor who seeks a\ntrustworthiness determination.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant is married and has three children.  Her husband worked for a local manufacturer\nfor 13 to 14 years before losing his job in 2001.  He was out of work for over two years before\nfinding new employment in October 2003 (R.T., at 26).  During the two years her husband was\nunemployed, Applicant was the lone  financial supporter of her household with her current job and\nhad to make up for the 50 per cent contributions from her husband (R.T., at 26, 28-29).  By the time\nher husband lost his job, Applicant already had two debts that had been charged off: credit card debt\nfor $1,562.00 (creditor 1.a) and loan for $1,469.00 (creditor 1.b). Unable to stay current with her\nbills on her single income, she fell behind with her debts as well.  Altogether, she accumulated 12\ndebts exceeding $12,000.00, which were either charged off, or placed for  collection, or carried on\nthe creditor\u2019s books as a delinquent account.\nApplicant separated from her husband in December 2003 but remains married to him (R.T.,\nat 30).  He provides financial support for their children, but not enough to enable Applicant to pay\nher current debts, contribute her share of child support on her youngest son, and pay off her old debts\n(R.T., at 31, 38).  Of the listed debts  in the SOR, she can point to just one that she is certain she paid\n(her creditor 1.I debt) after making agreed on monthly payments (see ex. 4; R.T., at 36-37).  Her\nApril 2005 personal financial statement reports a net remainder of just $75.68 (see 2), and she has\nno feasible way of paying all of her debts at this time.  The creditors she has contacted in the past\n(none within the last year) demanded payment of most the reported balances (R.T., at 38-39).\nCurrently, two of her children live with their in-laws; they provide both physical and financial\nsupport for the children at a time when Applicant\u2019s finances are stretched way too thin.  Her third\nchild (a 19-year old step son of her husband\u2019s) is in school.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nBefore the hearing, Applicant had never sought credit counseling and never pursued a\nChapter 13 plan (R.T., at 40). She attributes a lack of money to fund counseling and attorneys to her\nfailure to pursue credit counseling and Chapter 13 relief (R.T., at 40, 44-45)   She attempted to\nobtain loans to pay off her debts but was unsuccessful, and she has no available family support to\nhelp her with her debts (R.T., at 42-43).  \nSince her hearing, Applicant has inquired about a debt consolidation program (see exs. B and\nC).  Under the debt payment agreement proposed to her in December 2006, her identified delinquent\ndebts with be paid according to an amortized monthly payment schedule.  The proposed plan calls\nfor a monthly payment from Applicant in the amount of $480.00.  This payment is then allocated\namong her identified creditors holding claims totaling $11,524.35 according to a monthly payment\nschedule (see ex. C).  The proposed debt consolidated agreement is executed by the credit counseling\nagent, but not by Applicant.  In her attached e-mail to Department Counsel, Applicant indicates only\nthat the attached proposal \u201cis the agreement that they are willing to set up with me\u201d (see ex. B).  She\ndid not indicate any receipt of counseling or whether and under what circumstances she is prepared\nto go forward with this debt consolidation proposal. \nAfforded an opportunity to provide documentation of her executing the debt consolidation\nproposal and proof of any fee and debt payments to debt consolidation firm (see ex. E), Applicant\nconfirmed  that she had not executed the proposal or made any payments to the consolidation firm\n(ex. F).  She indicated the consolidation firm couldn\u2019t proceed with a payment plan until it had the\noriginal account numbers of her creditors, which she was endeavoring to obtain (see ex. F).\nApplicant was given and additional week to document her execution of the debt plan and provide\nproof of any payments to the firm, but failed to do so.  The record closed without any documented\npayment plan, fee and debt payments, or received counseling. \nApplicant is a team leader for her employee group and is highly regarded by friends and co-\nworkers who know her (R.T., at 27). Her documented performance evaluations covering the years\n2002 through 2005 report work efforts that either exceed or meet expectations (see ex. A). \nPOLICIES\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the Defense Office\nof Hearing and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,\nCommunication and Intelligence (ASDC31), entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA),\nwhich gave DOHA responsibility to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel\nworking on unclassified Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines covered in both DoD  Directive 5220.6 and DoD Regulation\n5200.2-R list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA\ncases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a\ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the\n\"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a trustworthiness determination\nshould be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\njudges must take into account the pertinent considerations for making a whole person assessment\nof the individual seeking a trustworthiness determination. In determining whether the applicant\nqualifies for a sensitive position under the trustworthiness standards of DoD 5200.2-R, the applicant\nmust be provided the due procedural protections contained in the Directive.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's application for a trustworthiness determination may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position depends, in large\npart, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge\nmay draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain an ADP I/II/III position.  The required showing of material\nbearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant\nhas actually abused a trust relationship before it can deny or revoke a trustworthiness determination.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to adhere to principles of trust.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant to establish his or her\ntrustworthiness  through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a highly regarded claims analyst for a defense contractor who accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts during periods of financial set backs primarily attributable to her\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nhusband\u2019s loss of employment. With the limited resources available to her, she has barely been able\nto keep up with her current household expenses and debts and has not been able to pay on any of her\nold debts.  To be sure, most of her old debts are barred by statutes of limitation.  Still, she\nacknowledges the listed debts and has recently explored debt consolidation arrangements. \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended that he or she is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts,\nwhich heretofore she has not been in a position to address, warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 1 (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nExtenuating circumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s lack of anticipated support from\nher husband for a considerable period of time while he was out of work and the limited support he\nhas provided since they separated in December 2003.  MC 3 of the financial considerations guideline\n(the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation) is clearly applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant over the past six years, Applicant has\nnot heretofore been in a position to address her old debts.  Several of Applicant\u2019s listed debts were\ncharged off before 2002.  The remaining debts (save for one) have been charged off since November\n2004, or earlier.  None of Applicant\u2019s listed debts reflect any collection action by the individual\ncreditors involved.  Based on this record, all of Applicant\u2019s debts appear to be barred from collection\nby the pertinent statute of limitation in South Carolina for debts.  See S.C. Code Ann. Sec. 15-3-530.\nWhile statutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for discouraging\nplaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, they have never been\nequated with good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at\n3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).\nApplicant does not assert relevant statutes of limitation in South Carolina in her defense.  She\ncontinues to work with her credit consolidation firm on identifying her old creditors in connection\nwith the debt consolidation proposal she produced.  Despite many months of trying to identify the\noriginal account numbers of these creditors, she has apparently been unable to do so.  Without these\noriginal account numbers, she insists the credit consolidation firm is not prepared to move forward\nwith its debt consolidation proposal.  Without a formal plan presented to her by the consolidation\nfirm, she has been unwilling to formally commit to the program with an executed agreement.  Absent\nan formal agreement, she has not been willing to pay the required  up-front fees and/or advance\npayments for ultimate disbursement to the creditors she hopes to identify.\nWhatever the problems Appellant has encountered in identifying her old creditors, she has\nnot articulated them sufficiently to permit assessments of the source of her difficulties, or when she\ncan expect to provide the needed information.  She provides no plausible reasons either for\nwithholding her written approval of the consolidation proposal and paying the conditioned fees\npending completion of a formulated repayment plan. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nWithout some type of documented repayment stream with her creditors, or at the very least\nan executed debt consolidation repayment/counseling t plan to reinforce her repayment\ncommitments, she may not yet claim good faith mitigation benefits.  MC 6 of the guidelines for\nfinancial considerations (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) can have no application for Applicant in this case.  Her failure to formally\ncommit to counseling with the debt consolidation/counseling firm she has been corresponding with\nprecludes her reliance on MC 4 (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) of the\nguidelines as well.\nHolding a favorable trustworthiness determination involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.   Financial stability\nin a person cleared to access information covered by privacy rights is required precisely to inspire\ntrust and confidence in the holder of the trustworthiness determination. \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledging her debts incurred during extenuating circumstances and\nexploring debt consolidation with financial counselors to address her debts reflects responsibility and\nan encouraging beginning for her.  She failed to seal her debt consolidation efforts with a written\nagreement, however, and at this time remains uncommitted to a repayment program.  \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, the positive judgment and trustworthiness impressions she has made on her\nfriends and colleagues, her solid performance evaluation, and her still incomplete repayment\ninitiatives she is able to document at this time, Applicant fails to mitigate trustworthiness concerns\nrelated to her debts.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the\nfinancial considerations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nfactors enumerated in the preamble of Appendix 8 of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, conclusions and\nguidelines listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following formal findings:\nFINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.I:\n            \nFOR APPLICANT\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\nSub-para. 1.j:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.k:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.l:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied. \nRoger C.

Norman, Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/II sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On May 17, 2006,\nDOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) pursuant to Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  The SOR was subsequently amended on\nmotion of the government without objection by Applicant to add allegations under Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On October 30, 2006,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant submitted a timely appeal pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n3\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred with respect to her\nfindings; whether the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s falsification of his Standard Form 85P\nwas deliberate; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised under\nGuidelines G, J, E, and H had not been mitigated.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge made several errors with respect to her findings.\nSpecifically, Applicant contends he had only been arrested on four criminal charges rather than six.\nThe Board concludes that Applicant has not demonstrated harmful error on the part of the Judge.\n The findings which Applicant challenges are at most harmless error, in that they would not\nbe reasonably likely to change the outcome of the case.  Applicant has not met his burden of\ndemonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect Applicant\u2019s circumstances of\ntrustworthiness concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of trustworthiness concern\nare supported by substantial evidence and are sustainable.\n(2) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his Standard Form 85P by failing to\ndisclose adverse information about his prior arrests and convictions.  It is Applicant\u2019s contention that\nthe omission of the information in question was unintentional\u2014the result of Applicant having\nprepared his Standard Form 85P based upon information \u201crecited off the top of [his] head\u201d without\na copy of his records before him.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nin that regard is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   \n(3) Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns\nraised under Guidelines G, J, E, and H had not been mitigated.  In that regard, Applicant essentially\nrestates the facts of his case and argues that the Judge misweighed the evidence by failing to give\nadequate consideration to the favorable evidence.  In particular, Applicant asserts that he has never\nconsumed alcohol before or during his work shift, that he has promised not to use illegal drugs in\nthe future, and that there is no relation between his prior disqualifying conduct and his current\ntrustworthiness.  Applicant also submits new evidence in the form of three character reference letters,\na copy of his criminal record, and a Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development document\nreferencing Wisconsin Statutes 111.31-111.395 which prohibit employers from denying employment\nto an individual with a criminal conviction unless they can show that the conviction was substantially\nrelated to the particular job.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on the part of the\nJudge.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005).  Moreover, compliance with state law is not required because\ntrustworthiness adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.\n\n4\nSee U.S. Constitution, Art. VI, Cl. 2 (Supremacy Clause).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0423 at 3\n(App. Bd. June 8, 2001); ISCR Case No. 03-17708 at 2, n. 5 (App. Bd. June 9, 2006). \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions.  She reasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating evidence to overcome\nthe government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by the Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29,\n2005). \nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n22325 at 3-4 (App. Bd. July 30, 2004).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant\nactually mishandles or fails to properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny\nor revoke access to such information.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).\nIn this case, Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption, illegal drug use, criminal conduct, and\nmultiple falsifications provide a sufficient rational basis for the Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness\ndetermination.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12548 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2006).  Given the\nrecord that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under\nGuidelines G, J, E and H is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\n\n5\nSigned: Jean E.

Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a nuclear machinist\nworking for a federal contractor.  He has been arrested twice for driving under the influence of\nalcohol (DUI) , once in 1985 and again in 1988.  As a consequence of the second incident, he lost\nhis drivers license, was require to pay a $500 fine, and to spend two days in jail, with six months\nsuspended.

The Judge found that, upon completion of the program in March 2004, he never\nreceived a copy of the discharge summary, and consequently was unaware of this diagnosis, until\nreceiving notification from DOHA during adjudication of his security clearance application.  He\nbelieved that he could drink in moderation, not realizing that he was alcohol dependent and,\ntherefore, required to abstain.\nIn September 2006 he was evaluated by a licensed clinical social worker, who concluded that\nApplicant had experienced more than two years in post-inpatient treatment without relapse and that\nhis overall prognosis was good, provided that he monitor his alcohol usage and frequency.  \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had been abstinent from alcohol for two months and\nhad entered Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  He did so that time due to his having finally seen the\ndischarge summary referenced above, which advised that he abstain from alcohol and attend AA or\nsome similar program.  He has a sponsor and does not intend to use alcohol in the future. \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\n\n3\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nIn the course of arguing the issue on appeal, Department Counsel has raised numerous\nchallenges to the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings.  The Board will address these challenges in the\ndiscussion below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\nSee, Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).\nth\nAfter the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge applied three Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (ACMC) to\nApplicant\u2019s case.  The first, ACMC 23(a), reads as follows: \u201cso much time has passed, or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.23(a).  \n1\nDecision at 4.  \n2\nSee U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F. 2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 974 (1966) (\u201cThe trier is entitled,\n3\nin fact bound, to consider the evidence as a whole; and, in law as in life, the effect of this generally is much greater than\nthe sum of the parts.\u201d) See also Schulz v. Secretary of HEW, 1987 WL 15314 (DC NJ 1987) (unreported decision),\nreversing an administrative law judge decision which considered various pieces of medical evidence separately rather\nthan as a whole. ( \u201c[The ALJ] arrived at [his] judgement through a piecemeal analysis of the medical evidence,\nconsidering separately rather than cumulatively the effects of plaintiff\u2019s conditions.

See also Tr. at 85: \u201cQ:  Did\nyour alcohol use ever contribute to you missing time at work?  A: Not that I know of.  Q: Do you recall the problems\nwith being absent at work, though? A: I got warning slips, yes.\u201d  \nTr. at 90.\n5\nDirective \u00b6 E2.23(b).  \n6\nDirective \u00b6 E2.23(d). \n7\n4\njudgement.\u201d   The Judge appeared to conclude that Applicant had met these criteria, in that his DUIs\n1\nhad \u201coccurred three years apart 20 years ago and do not indicate a pattern.\u201d   Department Counsel\n2\nargues that the Judge\u2019s reasoning on this point reflects a piecemeal analysis.  Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument has merit.  A Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s case in light of all the evidence and must\nconsider specific facts in light of the record as a whole.  Failure to do so may result in decisions\nmade without reference to significant contrary evidence and which are not founded upon a realistic\nunderstanding of an applicant\u2019s true circumstances.   In this case, the Judge\u2019s application of ACMC\n3\n23(a) does not take into account his January 2004 on the job alcohol incident, Applicant\u2019s having\nundergone alcohol treatment both in 1996 and in 2004, his having missed work due to alcohol\nconsumption,  and the fact that Applicant\u2019s misuse of alcohol has in the past alarmed his family and\n4\nassociates.   Therefore, the Judge\u2019s treatment of the DUIs in isolation from Applicant\u2019s extensive\n5\nhistory of alcohol related problems distorted his presentation of the circumstances from which\nApplicant\u2019s security concerns flowed and impaired his conclusion that Applicant had met his burden\nof production under this mitigating condition.\nThe Judge also extended favorable application to ACMC 23(b) and (d).  The former reads\nas follows: \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d   The latter reads: \u201cthe individual has\n6\nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required\naftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence\nin accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in [AA] or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified . . . licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d   The Judge found that\n7\nApplicant had met his burden of persuasion regarding these two mitigating conditions.  Department\nCounsel disagrees on the ground that the Judge did not take into account significant record evidence.\n\nCompare with previous edition of the Adjudicative Guidelines, Directive \u00b6 E2.A7.1.3.4.  \n8\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (8  ed. 2004).  \n9\nth\nDecision at 4.\n10\nGE 7 at 2.  \n11\nTr. at 81.  \n12\nTr. at 86.  There is no evidence that anyone involved in Applicant\u2019s treatment ever advised him to be other\n13\nthan abstinent.  \n5\nBoth of these mitigating conditions require Applicant to establish a pattern of abstinence or\nmodified/responsible use, depending upon Applicant\u2019s diagnosis .  The word \u201cpattern\u201d describes \u201c[a]\n8\nmode of behavior or series of acts that are recognizably consistent.\u201d   In the context of the two\n9\nmitigating conditions under consideration, it would connote responsible use or abstention for a\nperiod of time sufficient clearly to establish that an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability are not\nsubject to question.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s two months of abstention and AA\nattendance preceding the hearing constitute such a pattern.  Even if the Board were to concur with\nthat, it would require accepting as credible Applicant\u2019s testimony that he did not know he was\nsupposed to abstain from alcohol.  \nThe evidence is clear that Applicant continued to drink even after completion of his second\nalcohol treatment program and admitted as much.  He claimed that he did not receive a copy of the\ndischarge summary upon his release from the program and, therefore, did not know that he was\ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent and that he should refrain from consuming alcohol.  The Judge\naccepted Applicant\u2019s explanation for his continued drinking.  Acknowledging that Applicant\u2019s two\nmonths of abstention preceding the hearing was brief, he stated that \u201cthe briefness . . . is overcome\nby . . . the fact that he was not aware of the alcohol dependent diagnosis until he received documents\nrelating to this proceeding.\u201d  \n10\nThere is nothing in the record to contradict Applicant\u2019s testimony that he never got a copy\nof the discharge summary.  Whether that supports a conclusion that he reasonably did not know he\nwas supposed to abstain from alcohol requires a closer examination.  The summary states that,\n\u201c[g]iven the duration of [Applicant\u2019s] substance problem, it was felt that he needed to understand\nthe dynamics of addiction, its progressive nature and the medical consequences of using.  He was\nasked to establish a pro-recovery routine, which would support his abstinence.  This included\nattending education and therapy groups and AA/NA meetings every night . . .\u201d   (emphasis added)\n11\nThat Applicant was advised during the course of his treatment to abstain from alcohol and to attend\nAA is corroborated by Applicant\u2019s own testimony: \u201cQ: When you were being treated . . . did they\ndiscuss with you the need to stay abstinent and not drink any alcohol?  A: During the counseling\nsessions I suppose they did that . . . we read and we\u2019d discuss each other but as far as saying that\nthere\u2019s a need for abstinence I imagine that was said, yes.\u201d   \u201cQ: [Y]ou remembered discussions\n12\nabout abstaining from alcohol and how the people that you were in these group sessions with were\nrecommending that.  Is that right?  A: During the sessions, yes.  But not right prior to leaving.\u201d  \n13\nThis is further corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admission that, following his treatment, he did indeed\n\nTr. at 85.\n14\nCompare with GE 4, a letter from a licensed clinical social worker concerning his interview with Applicant.\n15\nShe states that Applicant \u201chas consumed alcohol . . . since six months after his treatment in 2004.\u201d  \nGE 4 at 3.  \n16\n\u201cQ: You didn\u2019t have this discharge summary when you met with [social worker], is that right?  Q: I don\u2019t\n17\nbelieve so.\u201d  Tr. at 81-2.  \nTr. at 77, 80.\n18\n\u201cHe realizes the dangers of his occasional alcohol consumption . . . He states that he will seek assistance\n19\nimmediately if usage changes.  He agrees to this plan.\u201d  GE 4 at 4.   \n6\nabstain from alcohol, though he resumed drinking four months later \u201cfor no particular reason.\u201d   \n14\n   \nTherefore,  whether or not Applicant actually received a copy of his discharge summary, there\nis substantial record evidence that he had been counseled to abstain and yet, four months after his\ntreatment, resumed the consumption of alcohol.    The record evidence is contrary to the Judge\u2019s\n15\nfinding that Applicant was unaware that he should abstain and vitiates the conclusion that his two\nmonths abstention prior to the hearing is sufficient to establish the pattern of reformed behavior\ncontemplated by ACMC 23(b) and (d).  The Judge\u2019s failure to address this significant contrary\nevidence impairs his favorable decision.  \nIn any case, it is not viable for the Judge to conclude that Applicant has established such a\nnew pattern of conduct in light of Applicant\u2019s extensive history of security-significant alcohol related\nconduct.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption has been a problem since the 1980s.  Given the totality\nof facts and circumstances in this case, two months\u2019 abstention is simply not sufficient to overcome\nsuch a lengthy history of alcohol consumption. \nWe also note that the Judge concluded that Applicant had met the requirement of ACMC\n23(d) of a \u201cfavorable prognosis by a . . . licensed clinical social worker,\u201d having spoken with such\na person in September 2006.  She reported to DOHA the results of her interview with Applicant.\nShe stated that Applicant admits \u201cto an occasional beer after working in the yard . . . he is fully aware\nthat should he ever exceed his one or two beers that he may relapse.\u201d   She also stated that\n16\n\u201c[Applicant] feels confident that he can control this occasional usage.\u201d  She opined that\n\u201c[Applicant\u2019s] overall prognosis is good, provided he continues to self monitor his usage with\ncontinued decrease in usage and frequency.\u201d   While this letter is favorable to Applicant, Department\nCounsel notes that the social worker did not have access to the 2004 discharge summary, with its\nrecommendations for abstinence and AA attendance.   Department Counsel notes that Applicant has\n17\napparently not followed the social worker\u2019s recommendation for decreasing his alcohol consumption\nbelow even the one or two beers that she referenced in her letter.  For example, he admitted to having\nconsumed four or five beers during a single day at some point after his appointment, and he admitted\nthat on an occasion in February 2007 he drank hard liquor to the point of intoxication.   These\n18\nmatters detract from the social worker\u2019s favorable opinion of Applicant\u2019s commitment to sobriety19\nand are inconsistent with a reasoned judgement that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion\nunder this mitigating condition.  \n\nTr. at 105.\n20\nGE 4 at 3.  Compare with the discharge summary, which described Applicant as \u201cnot in touch with the severity\n21\nof his situation.\u201d  GE 7 at 1.  \n7\nDepartment Counsel also draws attention to Applicant\u2019s apparent reluctance to accept his\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence.  At the end of the hearing his attorney asked him, \u201cyou concede\ntoday that . . . you are considered alcohol dependent?  A: I don\u2019t consider myself alcohol dependent\nbut I don\u2019t know how to answer that question.  Q: . . . But you concede that professionals who have\nlooked at you at [rehabilitation facility] diagnosed you with alcohol dependence, is that correct?  A:\nThat\u2019s their answer.\u201d   In addition, Applicant was apparently equivocal in his discussions with the\n20\nsocial worker, her letter stating that Applicant \u201cfeels his dependency on alcohol is not present.\u201d21\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that this reluctance detracts from Applicant\u2019s claim that he\nwill abstain from any future use of alcohol and can control his inclinations to drink.  In light of the\nforgoing, the record does not sustain the Judge\u2019s favorable decision that Applicant met his burden\nof persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d for him to have a\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s motivation\nto not repeat his problems is sufficient to overcome any problem arising from the relatively brief\nperiod of his abstinence. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn October 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn October 25, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on May 8, 2007 for\na hearing held on May 31, 2007. Seven government exhibits and one Applicant exhibit were\nadmitted into evidence. Applicant and one witness on his behalf testified. The government amended\none SOR allegation to conform to the facts. The transcript was received on June 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted with explanation the five allegations relating to alcohol consumption.\nAfter a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the entire\nrecord, the following findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor for 33 years with the same\ncompany who works as a nuclear machinist in a shipyard. He has held a security clearance since\n1987. \nApplicant has had difficulty with alcohol consumption. He has had two arrests for alcohol-\nrelated activities. They were for DUI\u2019s in 1985 and 1988 for which he received counseling for the\nfirst and loss of his driver\u2019s license, a $500 fine, and two days in jail with six months suspended\nwhile on probation for the second. In 1996 he completed a treatment program for alcohol use at a\nwell-known local facility near his workplace. He went voluntarily because he realized he needed\nhelp. His in-patient treatment was interrupted by hospitalization for pneumonia but he participated\nas an outpatient for ten of the twelve sessions offered by the facility and completed the program (Tr.\n53-55). \nIn January 2004, his most recent incident occurred while on the job when he was given a\nbreathalyser and escorted from his workplace. His shipyard had been closed for the holidays and he\nhad drank to excess over that period. He voluntarily went into treatment for 28 days at the same\n\n3\nfacility where he had been in 1996. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent according to the facility\nrecords (Exh. 7) but he was not given a discharge summary so was not advised of the diagnosis until\nthis matter arose and he received documentation from the government. Thus, he thought that he\ncould drink in moderation which he was doing but did not recognize that one who is alcohol\ndependent should be abstinent. \nOn September 12, 2006, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical social worker who\nfound that he had been over two years in post in-patient treatment without relapse and that his overall\nprognosis was good provided he continued to monitor his alcohol usage and frequency (Exh. A). \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was abstinent and had been since March 2007 when he\nentered Alcoholics Anonymous after first learning of the diagnosis of alcohol dependence. He\nattends meetings every Friday and is in the twelve step program. He has a sponsor who supports him\nand he has adjusted to the program. He does not intend to use alcohol in the future (Tr. 59-61). \nApplicant is well regarded by his employer. His supervisor who has known him for 30 years\nvouches for his trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity as well as his work ethic (Tr. 24-25). In\naddition to his regular duties, Applicant mentors younger employees of the company and those who\nhave returned to work needing refreshers after lay-offs. He works as much overtime as he can and\nthat is often 70-80 hours a week. \nApplicant has never been married, lives alone, walks to work, and has his mother, siblings\nand their children in his supportive family with whom he is close. His work at his company has been\nhis life since graduation from high school when he was first hired by the company. He intends to do\nall within his power to insure that he continues to work, and that he does not endanger his health.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\n\n4\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe government cited a disqualifying condition (DC) under the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) pursuant to the Directive concerning alcohol consumption under Guideline G. The\nsecurity concern is that excessive alcohol consumption leads to exercise of questionable judgment\nand can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness (AG 21). The specific\nconcern is alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence. (AG\n22 a), alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work in an intoxicated or impaired\ncondition (AG 22 b), and diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol dependence\n(AG 22 d). \nPossible mitigating conditions (MC) might include the fact that so much time has passed, or\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement (AG 23 a), the individual\nacknowledges his alcoholism, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence if alcohol dependent (AG 23 b), and the individual has\nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling along with required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated an clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in such as\nparticipation in meetings of AA and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program (AG 23 d).\nBoth DUI arrests occurred three years apart 20 years ago and do not indicate a pattern of\nconduct. The 2004 incident at work resulted in Applicant\u2019s taking action to resolve his alcohol\nrelated difficulties and he has received a favorable prognosis from a licensed clinical social worker\nin September 2006. While the period of his abstinence is relatively brief, the briefness of the period\nis overcome by Applicant\u2019s strongly stated and demonstrated intent not to jeopardize his employment\nand health, and the fact that he was not aware of the alcohol dependent diagnosis until he received\ndocuments relating to this proceeding. The mitigating factors cited are applicable in view of the facts\nestablished in this matter. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nApplicant has held steady employment for 33 years and is well regarded for his work and\n\n5\ndedication to his company. He has recognized his conduct could jeopardize his job which is his\nentire life outside his family. He has taken the necessary steps to insure that further incidents with\nalcohol do not happen. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a\nsecurity clearance to him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\n1\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security\n2\nconcerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised AG  were provided to Applicant\nwhen the SOR was issued. \nIn a document, dated January 23, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested an in-person hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 22, 2007. A Notice of\nHearing was issued on February 28, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 14, 2007. The hearing\nwas rescheduled because Applicant retained counsel. Another Notice of Hearing was issued on\nMarch 16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for April 3, 2007. A Notice of Appearance was filed by\nApplicant\u2019s attorney on March 21, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. At the hearing, the\nGovernment offered five exhibits, Exs. 1-5, and Applicant offered one exhibit, Ex. A. All exhibits\nwere admitted into the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 16, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the allegations under Guideline M, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f. After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,\nI make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 41 years olds and has been employed as an information systems security\nmanager by a defense contractor since August 2005.

He also teaches\n4\ncourses on information security at a local university. His teachings include a lecture on ethics, styled\nafter his professional experiences in that area.

A few months after he started working, he was accused\n6\nof improperly accessing a coworker\u2019s email on at least one occasion without her permission or\nknowledge. He admitted accessing a female coworker\u2019s email because she asked him to reset her\npassword, providing him access to her email inbox.  He looked in the email inbox because he had\n7\nasked her out on a date and wanted to see her response. He only looked at the email that she had sent\nto him.  While there, he received three exceptional ratings or awards.  \n8\n9\nIn 1997, Applicant was promoted to a senior engineer at the same agency. He was accused\nof improperly accessing his team leader\u2019s computer and email on at least one occasion without his\npermission or knowledge. Applicant admitted that this incident occurred but:\n. . . it was with his [team leader\u2019s] knowledge. It wasn\u2019t necessarily without his\nknowledge. He routinely asked, when he was traveling, he would routinely ask for\nus to \u2013 to access his computer to check his emails.10\nApplicant testified that he was able to access his team leader\u2019s email \u201c[b]ecause he gave me\nthe user ID and password. He gave it to all 15 of us on his team.\u201d  He revealed that his team leader\n11\nhad threatened him in the past, specifically, when Applicant told his superior that it was\ninappropriate to execute a particular task.  Applicant filed a grievance indicating the task he was\n12\nasked to do was inappropriate. Holding a copy of Applicant\u2019s grievance, his team leader stated\n\u201c[y]our life at [agency] is over.\u201d  He repeated it twice. Applicant was scared. He was motivated to\n13\nlook at the email because \u201cI wanted to see if I was in any harm.\u201d Classified information was not\naccessed.14\nIn 1997, he was accused of improperly copying at least one \u201cZIP file\u201d from his team leader\u2019s\ncomputer without his permission or knowledge. Applicant testified that he had no recollection of this\nactivity and denied doing it.15\n\nTr. 28.\n16\nTr. 31.\n17\nTr. 29.\n18\nTr. 30.\n19\nEx. 5 (First Appeal Review, dated May 4, 1999).\n20\nTr. 66-67, 70.\n21\nTr. 67.\n22\nTr. 69, 72-73.\n23\nTr. 74.\n24\nTr. 74-75.\n25\nTr. 75.\n26\n5\nWhile continuing to work at the same federal agency, Applicant was charged with improperly\nperforming computer attacks, outside the scope of his employment and authority, against the\nagency\u2019s computer systems. Applicant indicated that he did this task with authorization from his\nteam leader.  The purpose was to go into the email system and identify trivial or easy passwords\n16\ncreated by users. After that, Applicant:\n. . . called them [user] on the phone and said, \u2018you  need to change your password in\nthe system.\u2019 Because it\u2019s my [Applicant\u2019s] responsibility to manage the contractors\nthat are supporting that system, I requested that those contractors reset the passwords,\nor ordered that they have the password be changed for those users.17\nApplicant averred that his team leader was next to him when he executed the computer attacks.18\nThese computer attacks occurred approximately three to six times between 1996 and 1997.\nApplicants\u2019 employment at the agency was terminated in October 1997.19\nOn February 12, 1999, Applicant was denied SCI access by NSA. On May 4, 1999, following\nhis appeal, NSA\u2019s denial of his SCI access was sustained.20\nApplicant had three character witnesses testify on his behalf at the hearing. The first witness\ncurrently is an information systems security specialist at a federal agency and has a top secret\nsecurity clearance with special accesses.  She first met Applicant in 1997 at the federal agency\n21\nwhere they both worked. They worked together for two and one-half years, but they have managed\nto stay in touch.  She recalled that several colleagues had direct access to the team leader\u2019s email\n22\npassword and user identification, a direct violation of security protocol.  She was aware that\n23\nApplicant had the team leader\u2019s user identification and password but she never saw Applicant access\nhis email.  The team leader had asked her \u201cif we had enough money on my contract with\n24\n[contractor] to hire some infoware specialists.\u201d  \u201cInfoware specialists are people who try to do\n25\npenetration testing and things of that nature to try to break in [internal computer system].\u201d  Upon\n26\nhearing her negative response, the team leader stated \u201cwell, I guess we\u2019ll just have to do it in-\n\nTr. 75.\n27\nTr. 75.\n28\nTr. 90, 91.\n29\nTr. 91.\n30\nTr. 92.\n31\nTr. 92.\n32\nTr. 92.\n33\nTr. 94.\n34\nTr. 95.\n35\nTr. 96.\n36\nTr. 100-101.\n37\nTr. 102, 107-108.\n38\nTr. 103.\n39\n6\nhouse.\u201d  She testified that after this conversation, Applicant was called into the team leader\u2019s office,\n27\nand the computer attacks began shortly thereafter. She indicated that Applicant was very smart, with\nthe highest integrity, but naive, in that \u201che never questioned management.\u201d28\nThe second witness was employed as a senior security consultant and met Applicant on the\njob in either 1997 or 1998.  He and Applicant \u201cworked on many jobs together, and traveled all\n29\naround the world together.\u201d  He and Applicant continued to work together at different job locations,\n30\nhave kept in touch, and socialize outside of work.  He implicitly trusts Applicant, and Applicant has\n31\nthe keys to his house.  Also, \u201c[h]e [Applicant] has access to my systems, and I don\u2019t give that out\n32\nreadily. I \u2013 in fact, he\u2019s the only one that has access to any of my systems.\u201d  Applicant told him\n33\nabout the computer attacks and he testified that \u201c[h]e [Applicant] thought that his boss had authority\nto do that.\u201d  As a self-employed consultant, he is paid to do computer attacks for his customers.\n34\n35\nHe acknowledged that when he worked with Applicant, he was \u201cvery well respected, a phenomenal\ntechnical person. Very good with the clients.\u201d36\nThe third witness was Applicant\u2019s supervisor for a little more than two years. The week after\nthe hearing, the witness was to be director of strategic capture for another defense contractor.  He\n37\nhas known Applicant for at least four years. When he met him, he was impressed with Applicant\u2019s\ncredentials.  He requested that Applicant seek a security clearance.  He knew about the email and\n38\n39\ncomputer attacks. He stated: \nIt\u2019s not unusual for someone in the position [Applicant] was in, especially at his\nage, but in a position he was in, to be asked to do what he did. It is not unusual.

And so I\u2019ve asked\nthat to be done because we needed that information.40\nIn a letter dated April 2, 2007, another character reference stated he has worked for the\nfederal government in the intelligence and security fields for more than 15 years.  During the past\n41\nyear, he has personally witnessed Applicant\u2019s integrity when working with him on several highly\nsensitive and critical initiatives for the government. \u201cIn all of my dealings with [Applicant], I have\nfound him to be an honest and trustworthy person, who consistently follows agency rules and\nguidelines.\u201d\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n42\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n43\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n44\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n45\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n46\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n47\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\n8\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, together with the whole-person, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nMisuse of information technology systems, under Guideline M, is always a security concern\nbecause the noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to\ninformation technology systems may raise security concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems,\nnetworks, and information. The Government has established a prima facie case for disqualification\nunder Guideline M, use of information technology systems.\nApplicant testified that after a female colleague asked him to change her email password, he\nread an email message that she had sent him. He did this because he had asked her out on a date and\nwas curious about her response. He did abuse his position as an administrator of the agency\u2019s system.\nHis behavior at that time was inappropriate and created a violation of trust that he had. Moreover,\nafter being threatened by his team leader, he went into his email mailbox to read a message to see\nif or how he was going to be harmed. Thus, Use of Information Technology Systems Disqualifying\nCondition (IT DC) \u00b6 40(a) (illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology systems\nor component thereof) and IT DC \u00b6 40(b) (illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction,\nmanipulation or denial of access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information\ntechnology system) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate misuse of information technology systems concerns. Applicant\nis a smart, respected individual, trusted by the colleagues who testified about his character. He was\nalso presented as naive and doing what was asked, rather than inquiring about the legalities or\nauthority concerning what he was told to do. He credibly testified about accessing his team leader\u2019s\nemail, but he insisted that it was done at the bequest of the supervisor. The second witness\ncorroborated his testimony and indicated that she knew that several people were given access to the\nteam leader\u2019s user identification and password, which she believed was against security protocol.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony was convincing when he spoke about  the computer attacks he performed,\nauthorized by his team leader. His testimony was corroborated by the first witness who was asked\nby the team leader if funds were available to get a contractor to do the job. When he was informed\nthat there was no money for a computer attack, he told her it would be done by in-house staff, and\nhe gave that responsibility to Applicant. The second witness testified that he is paid to do computer\nattacks for his customers. Based on all of the testimony, I conclude that if Applicant was attacking\nhis federal agency\u2019s computer system without authorization, he would have been stopped after the\nfirst attack. Moreover, he would not have had an opportunity to successfully complete additional\nattacks on the same computer system. All of the witnesses gave him accolades for his\nprofessionalism, honesty, and trustworthiness. Thus, Use of Information Technology Systems\nMitigating Condition \u00b6 41(a) (so much time has passed since the behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the\n\n9\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant has mitigated the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.f of the SOR are concluded in favor of\nApplicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I am\nmindful that he was denied SCI access in 1999 and lost his appeal of that decision. His immaturity\nand low self-esteem, allowed him to snoop into emails that he was unauthorized to access for his\nown personal perusal. I conclude that those negative traits are behind him and occurred more than\n10 years ago. Applicant has matured, and is a well-respected worker. He is a more polished,\nknowledgeable, and savvy employee. Applicant is by all accounts a hard-working man, although\nnaive at times, and he has forged relationships with coworkers over the years. They took the time to\ntestify on his behalf, and have not wavered in their trust of him With the acquisition of more\nprofessional experience, he has honed his business acumen and now knows how to act, interact, and\nreact to directives given to him by those in superior positions. He has developed a presence that\nallows him to inquire, if necessary, about the appropriateness of tasks that he has to execute. Because\nhe is smart, and highly thought of at work, he is more assured about his skills and voice in the\nworkplace because his colleagues believe in him as a responsible member of the team. There is no\nreason for Applicant to deviate from displaying the appropriate professionalism in any work\nenvironment in the future. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to\nclassified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nMarch 28, 2007, scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for April 17, 2007. On April 13, 2007, Department\nCounsel moved to continue the case to April 19, 2007. Applicant did not object, whereupon, I\ncontinued the case, and rescheduled it to the requested date. During the hearing, I received four\ngovernment exhibits, the testimony of a government witness, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the\nApplicant\u2019s request, I left the record open through May 4, 2007 to allow her to submit additional\nexhibits. On May 2, 2007, she submitted one additional exhibit which I marked and received as\nExhibit A. DOHA received the transcript on May 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old woman with two teenage children. She is a U.S. Army veteran,\nserving from 1986 through her honorable discharge in 1988. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in\ncomputer science in 2003. Currently, she works as a production control clerk.2\nBetween 1996 and 1998, Applicant was charged 18 times with writing bad checks. She wrote\n12 of them to purchase food in a cafeteria in the building where she worked at the time. According\nto Applicant, she postdated the checks anticipating future deposits, and the company that managed\nthe cafeteria would attempt to cash them before her deposits cleared.  The charges were consolidated\n3\n\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j, 1.n, and 1.q.\n4\nSubparagraph 1.k.\n5\nTr. 28.\n6\nTr. 25. Her husband began paying steady child support payments in approximately 2001 (Tr. 41).\n7\nTr. 26.\n8\nTr. 31.\n9\nSubparagraph 1.z.\n10\nSubparagraph 1.aa.\n11\nSubparagraph 1.v.\n12\nExhibit A, Customer Equipment Maintenance Documents, dated June 6, 2005.\n13\n3\ninto one criminal proceeding.  On December 12, 1998, she pled guilty to each, and paid\n4\napproximately $110 in restitution.\nOn September 4, 1997, Applicant wrote a check to a car dealership for $1,300 in order to\nhelp a family friend purchase a car.  She instructed the salesman not to cash the check until her\n5\nfriend gave her the cash to cover the check.  Her friend never gave her the money, and when the\n6\nsalesman attempted to cash the check, it bounced. In August 1998, she pleaded guilty to a worthless\ncheck charge, was ordered to pay $1,300 restitution, and sentenced to 12 months probation.\nApplicant wrote the remaining bad checks, as listed in Subparagraphs 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and\n1.r. of the SOR, to miscellaneous payees. She paid restitution, as ordered, for the checks listed in\nsubparagraphs 1.l and 1.m. The charge listed in subparagraph 1.r was dismissed. The record is\nunclear with respect to the outcome of the charges listed in subparagraphs 1.o and 1.p.\nApplicant attributes her problems with bouncing checks to financial difficulties caused by\na marital separation in approximately 1997 followed by a divorce in 2001. During that time, she was\nreceiving no child support.  Also, she attributed her problems to an inability to manage her\n7\ncheckbook.  Approximately four years ago, she obtained overdraft protection on her checking\n8\naccount.  Since that time, she has not written any more worthless checks.\n9\nIn 2001, Applicant\u2019s car was repossessed.  After the dealer resold it, Applicant owed a\n10\ndeficiency of approximately $4,092. In 2004, another vehicle she had purchased on credit was\nrepossessed.  She attributes the second repossession to a 15-month period of unemployment she\n11\nexperienced between 2003 and 2004. She owes a deficiency of approximately $3,605 on the second\nrepossessed vehicle. Currently, both deficiencies remain unpaid.\nApplicant owed a cable television company approximately $551 for some equipment she\nfailed to return after switching providers in 2003.  In 2005, the cable company canceled the\n12\nobligation after she returned the equipment.13\n\nTr. 27.\n14\n4\nWith respect to the remaining debts listed in the SOR, Applicant either contests them\n(subparagraphs 1.s, 1.u, and 1.y), or contends they have been satisfied (subparagraph 1.t, 1.w, and\n1.x). She offered no evidence to support either contention. \nOn November 29, 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application. She failed to\nlist the worthless check charges in response to Question 26 (In the past 7 years, have you been\narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, 25?\n(Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.) For this\nitem, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise\nstricken from the record). In her answer, she explained that she could not recall them at the time she\ncompleted the application. At the hearing, she testified that she was unaware they were criminal\ncharges.14\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n15\n5\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n15\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nBetween 1996 and 2004, Applicant accrued approximately $9,000 of delinquent debt, and\nwas charged criminally on 18 occasions for bouncing checks. Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, FC DC 19\n(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud,\nincome tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional\nfinancial breaches of trust, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may\nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis, apply.\nAlthough a divorce and a subsequent 15-month unemployment exacerbated Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(b): the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply.\nApplicant repeatedly wrote worthless checks knowing she had insufficient funds in her checking\naccount. Moreover, her first repossession occurred after her ex-husband had begun making steady\nchild support payments, and before she lost her job in 2003.\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions, and conclude none apply. Applicant\nhas only resolved one delinquency, and admits that she has taken no action to resolve the two most\nsignificant ones. Her contention that the remainders either are in dispute or have been satisfied was\nunsupported by evidence. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\n\n6\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s omission of the worthless check charges in response to Question 26 of the SOR\ntriggers the issue of whether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a) applies as\nfollows: deliberate omission concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. Her credibility was undermined\nby her contradictory explanations for the omissions. PC DC 16(a) applies without mitigation.\nSOR subparagraph 2.b alleges that each worthless check charge constitutes a personal\nconduct security concern in addition to a financial considerations security concern as cross-alleged\nearlier. Such cross-alleging is redundant and unnecessary. Subparagraph 2.b represents an\nunmitigated security concern for the same reasons as set forth in the Financial Considerations\nsection of the analysis.\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s succession of worthless check charges and subsequent intentional omission of\nthem from her SF 86 generates a security concern under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition\n(CC DC) 31(a): A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. Although Applicant acquired\noverdraft protection to prevent writing worthless checks approximately four years ago, and has not\nwritten one in nearly ten years, her more recent falsification of her security clearance application\ngenerates lingering questions about her propensity to resort to criminal conduct when she finds it\nexpedient. None of the mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant deserves credit for returning to college and earning a degree during the same time\nshe was raising her children and going through a divorce. This favorable evidence is outweighed\nby her falsification of the SF 86, and her failure to take significant steps to address her delinquent\nfinancial indebtedness. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.v-1.aa:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nMarc E.

Since the age of 16, she has suffered chronic and recurring kidney stones and renal\ninfections.  From 1999 until 2004, she required increased dosages of prescription pain medications,\nbecoming addicted to their use.  In 2004, she began abusing these medications by taking more than\nwas prescribed for her, ultimately leading to her attempt to fraudulently procure these controlled\nsubstances from a pharmacy.  In April 2005, she entered a plea of guilty to one charge, and was\nplaced on probation for two years.  She is rehabilitated and using the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d, she\nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline\nH (Drug Involvement).  Clearance is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1, Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application, dated October 14, 2004.\n1\nTr. at 16, 18.\n2\nId. at 17.\n3\nId.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 13, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\non August 8, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the Directive.  The President issued\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (RAG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the RAG are to\nbe used in all cases when the SOR is issued on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was\nissued prior to September 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this case proceed under the old\nguidelines.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 21, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2006.  The Notice\nof Hearing, dated January 26, 2007, was issued to convene a hearing on February 14, 2007, to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  The government offered four exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-4, received\nwithout objections.  Applicant offered five exhibits marked as exhibits A-E, received without\nobjections.  I kept the record open until February 23, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file\nadditional documents.  She filed one document that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.  The\ngovernment had no objection and Exhibit F was admitted.  DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) on February 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following  additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 24-year-old procurement administrative assistant employed by a federal\ncontractor.   She is single and a high school graduate.   She has no military service and this is her\n2\n3\nfirst application for a security clearance.  \n4\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 4-5.\n5\n Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, Letter dated February 21, 2007.\n6\nApplicants Answer to the SOR, dated September 20, 2006, at 1.\n7\n4\nOn September 21, 2004, Applicant was charged with two counts of obtaining or attempting\nto obtain a controlled drug by uttering a false or forged prescription, a felony.  On January 24, 2005,\nshe pled guilty to one count, as charged, and count two was dismissed.  She was found guilty by the\ncourt.  On April 22, 2005, she was placed on probation for two years, ordered to obtain a drug\nevaluation, and ordered to submit to monthly drug tests.  She disclosed this information on her SF\n86.5\nFrom 1999 through 2004, Applicant\u2019s physician prescribed Percocet\u2122, Vicodin\u2122, and\nTramadol\u2122 to control her pain.  During 2004, she abused Percocet\u2122 and Tramadol\u2122 by consuming\nmore than the prescribed amount of medication, taking approximately seven to eight pills a day.  In\nNovember and December 2004, she sought addiction counseling and chemical detoxification on\nthree occasions.   Between January and November 2005, she attended monthly addiction counseling\n6\nwith her physician.\nSince the age of 16, Applicant suffered from chronic and recurring kidney stones and renal\ninfections.  This medical condition causes severe pain and often requires surgery to remove kidney\nstones that are too large to pass on their own.  The first kidney stone was diagnosed at age 16.  A\nsecond came about seven months later.  Thereafter, almost every five or six months, she was either\nin an emergency room with severe pain from a kidney stone or hospitalized from a surgical\nprocedure.  Her urologist performed a variation of tests but could never pinpoint an exact cause of\nthe recurring kidney stones.  She saw several different urologists and endocrinologists, none of\nwhom were able to find preventive measures for these kidney stones.  During this time, her doctors\nkept her on pain and nausea medications to treat her symptoms.  Beginning in 2004, she would feel\nsick (nausea, insomnia, cold sweats, muscle aches, vomiting, and high blood pressure) when she\ndidn\u2019t take her pain medication.  The doctor explained that her body had become dependent on the\npain medications and that she was experiencing withdrawal symptoms from taking medication for\nsuch a long period.  The doctor continued her on Percocet for emergencies and suggested she try\nUltracet\u2122 for daily use.  Ultracet\u2122 is a less addictive pain medicine but still a morphine derivative.7\nHer addiction continued as she stated:\nThe doctor would give me one prescription a month and no more.  I had built such\na high tolerance and would need more than a month supply of pain medication to\nmanage the pain in withdrawal symptoms.  I realized at that time that I was dealing\nwith a difficult addiction.  I was so afraid of going through the pain in withdrawal,\nand I didn\u2019t know how to ask for help.  There was no part of me that enjoyed being\ndependent on a medication to be able to function.  This was never something I did\nfor recreational use; it was medication that my body had developed a dependency on\nin the previous five years.  I would ask the doctor for refills on the medication before\nthe month was up and she would deny my request.  As my withdrawal symptoms\n\nId. at 2.\n8\nId. at 3.\n9\nId.  \n10\nId.  \n11\nId. at 4.\n12\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A, Letter dated January 31, 2007.\n13\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C, Letter dated September 21, 2006;  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E, Letter dated February 8, 2007.\n14\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D, Letter dated September 21, 2006.\n15\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E, Letter dated August 17, 2006.\n16\n5\nincreased, I took desperate measures and tried to call the prescription in myself,\nleading to my arrest and felony charge.8\nIn November 2004, Applicant entered a voluntary detoxification program, then enrolled in\ncounseling sessions.   She has continued to counseling sessions to the present, and plans to continue\n9\nthat the sessions, even though she feels she has been rehabilitated from her dependency.  She claims\nto have a large support system of friends and family and that she now knows how to ask for help\nwhen she needs it.  She has been off the prescribed medications since November 2004.10\nApplicant\u2019s medical condition continues and she has learned to deal with and tolerate her\npain without the use of prescribed narcotic derivatives.   She has a final court appearance regarding\n11\nher probation in April 2007.12\nApplicant\u2019s personnel security specialist stated that Applicant had been open and honest\nabout providing information with respect to her prescription drug abuse and subsequent\nrehabilitation efforts.  She recommends Applicant as being a person trustworthy of holding a security\nclearance.   Two of Applicant\u2019s co-workers sent letters requesting that she be granted a security\n13\nclearance.   \n14\nHer probation office sent a letter stating that Applicant had remained compliant with rules\nand regulations of her probation supervisor, she reported as instructed, has maintained a stable\nresidence and employment, that all drug tests have been negative for illegal drug use, and she met\nall special conditions ordered by the court.  She stated that her psychiatrist had confirmed treating\nher for opiate dependency for treatment for chronic recurring kidney stones, and he reported that she\nhad been off opiate medications since January 2005.  She stated that Applicant had been honest and\ncooperative, and that she has expressed regret for her actions and has continued a to maintain a\npositive attitude.   Her psychiatrist stated: \u201cIt is my opinion that Applicant is medically and\n15\npsychiatrically able to obtain any level of security clearance.  I feel strongly that her prior difficulties\nwould not have occurred if she had not been prescribed opiate medications to treat her pain.\u201d16\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n17\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n6\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses\n17\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n18\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n7\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.18\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct  \nThe government established its case under Guideline J.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged) and  E2.A10.1.2.2. (A single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses) apply.  Applicant admitted her crime. \nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (The criminal behavior was\nnot recent), E2.A10.1.3.3. (The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in that person's life), E2.A10.1.3.4. (The person did not voluntarily\ncommit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur), and E2.A10.1.3.5.\n(Acquittal) do not apply.  While the crime occurred in 2004, she was not sentenced until 2005, and\nis still on probation.  The criminal conduct is still an on-going process.  No one forced her to commit\na crime.  She was addicted to pain medications, although she appears to have her problem under\ncontrol and is not likely to commit a similar violation again.  And there is no acquittal as she entered\na plea of guilty.\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions E2.A10.1.3.2. (The crime was an isolated incident)\napplies, as does CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).  She\n\nE2.A8.1.1.3. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\n19\nmedical direction.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.3.\n20\n8\nhas this only criminal charge on her record.  She has not used  prescription pain medication since the\nbeginning of 2005.  Her probation officer\u2019s report is excellent.  She has been honest with her\nemployer. \nDrug Involvement\nThe government established its case under Guideline H.  Drug Involvement Disqualifying\nCondition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (Any drug abuse)  is applicable, because Applicant admitted  abuse\n19\nof prescription drugs.\nDrug Involvement Mitigating Condition E2.A8.1.3.2. (The drug involvement was an isolated\nor aberrational event) does not apply because her abuse lasted over about a five year period.\nDrug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC)  E2.A8.1.3.1. (The drug involvement was\nnot recent), E2.A8.1.3.3. (A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future), and\nE2.A8.1.3.4. (Satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including\nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis\nby a credentialed medical professional) all apply.  Applicant has not used prescription pain\nmedications in over two years.  She has learned to control her pain with over-the-counter pain\nmedicines.  She has demonstrated her intent not to use by continuing to see her psychiatrist for\ncounseling on a  regular basis, even though she has completed her required treatment programs.  Her\ndoctor\u2019s prognosis is favorable. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of her criminal conduct and drug\nabuse, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  As noted above, \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1, E2.2.2, and E2.2.3\nof the Directive specifically require each administrative judge to consider all the facts and\ncircumstances, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual case.  In\naddition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general\nadjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept.  Applicant has made progress in\nresolving her abuse of prescription pain medications.  She controls her pain with over-the-counter\nmedications.  She successfully completed a treatment program.  She continues to see her psychiatrist\nregularly to help her to control her pain without prescriptions.  Her doctor has given her a positive\nprognosis.  She has expressed remorse for her actions and I am confident she will not, in the future,\nattempt to obtain any prescription medications by fraudulent means.  Based upon a report from her\nprobation officer I believe she will successfully complete that probation.\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\u2013not the potentially disqualifying or mitigating conditions\u2013is the\nheart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.   Indeed, the Appeal\n20\nBoard has repeatedly held that an administrative judge may find in favor of an applicant where no\nspecific mitigating conditions apply.\n\n9\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all of the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I determine she has mitigated the security\nconcerns pertaining to criminal conduct and drug involvement.  I have no concerns about her\nreliability, judgment, and honesty.  The totality of the circumstances and her actions subsequent to\nher drug abuse and her criminal activity, leads me to conclude that this record raises no reasonable\nand persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its\ninterests.  Therefore, notwithstanding that Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions E2.A6.1.3.1.,\nE2.A10.1.3.3., E2.A10.1.3.4., E2.A10.1.3.5., and E2.A8.1.3.2. do not apply, under the \u201cwhole person\nconcept\u201d, I conclude Guideline F and Guideline E for Applicant, and determine it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 27, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 17, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.\nMatchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings were based upon substantial evidence; whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nDepartment Counsel had met its burden of production; and whether the Judge erred in her\napplication of the appropriate mitigating conditions.  We further construe Applicant\u2019s brief as\nasserting that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law and that\nthe Judge was biased against Applicant.  Finding no error, we affirm. \nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer working for a\ndefense contractor.

His failure to pay the debt\n\n2\nwhen he has the financial wherewithal to do so raises substantial Financial Considerations concerns.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 27, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,  and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant, acting pro se, answered the SOR\non December 15, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on February 5, 2007.\nWith the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on May 9, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Applicant appeared with counsel. Three Government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and 13 Applicant\nexhibits (Ex. A-M) were admitted, and testimony was taken from Applicant, as reflected in a\ntranscript (Tr.) received on May 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owed $10,669 in charged off delinquent\ndebt that had not been paid as of May 17, 2005. Applicant denied owing the two debts of $1,885 (\u00b6\n1.a) and $8,784 (\u00b6 1.b), thereby placing the burden on the Government of proving the debts. After\na thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following findings\nof relevant and material facts.\nApplicant is a 42-year-old lead engineer who began working for a defense contractor in\nDecember 2003. He stayed on after the company was acquired by another defense contracting firm,\nand he requires a security clearance for his duties.\nApplicant earned his college degree in physics and mathematics in 1986. After one semester\nof graduate study in physics, he started working in the Washington, D.C. area as a cryptological\nmathematician for a U.S. Government agency in mid-December 1987. Within a few months, he was\ngranted a TOP SECRET clearance and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access. His\nstarting salary was about $25,000 annually. Single and with no dependents, Applicant lived within\nhis means. He rented his residence, made accelerated payments on a 1995 model-year vehicle that\nhe bought in 1994, and paid his revolving credit charges in full within the billing cycle.\nApplicant was very persistent, organized, and detailed oriented on the job. In 1996, he\ncomplained to the agency\u2019s Inspector General about some perceived misconduct that he thought he\n\nApplicant testified he was still paying \u201cthousands of dollars to attorneys\u201d to resolve his employment dispute\n1\nwith the federal agency. (Tr. 83)\n3\nwitnessed at the agency. Whether out of retaliation by the agency as Applicant claims, or for cause,\nhis clearance and access were suspended in about December 1996. Under pressure, he resigned from\nhis employment effective late January 1997, although he was absent from the agency for about a\nmonth. His annual salary at the time of his termination was between $56,000 and $57,000.\nUnemployed, Applicant moved back home to Kentucy where he resided with his mother rent\nfree. He had his household goods shipped, paying the cost out of the $10,000 to $20,000 in savings\nhe had accumulated when he was working. Applicant received unemployment benefits for about six\nmonths but thereafter lived off his savings and consumer credit exclusively. Confident he had done\nnothing wrong, and of the opinion that his clearance had been suspended without due process, he\nspent his time and funds looking for an attorney to represent him on appeal of his clearance\nsuspension and separation from federal civilian employment. He incurred travel costs to D.C. and\nretainer fees to meet with several attorneys who declined to take his case.\nIn summer 1997, Applicant relocated to Florida, joining his father who had offered to help\nhim find legal counsel in his area. With money tight, he listed his automobile for sale with an online\nvehicle trading board in August 1997, at an asking price of $17,025. Applicant had previously\nattempted to sell the vehicle in November 1996 when it became clear to him that his continued\nemployment with the federal agency was in jeopardy (\u201cI knew I was being set up for termination.\u201d\nTr. 48). It did not sell, and Applicant had trouble making the car payments. The vehicle was\neventually repossessed in April 1998.\nOn May 11, 1998, Applicant paid a D.C. area attorney a $10,000 retainer fee to represent him\nin his suit against the agency. With an attorney to handle his legal case, Applicant devoted his full\nattention to his job search in the field of mathematics. He relied on consumer credit regularly for\nmeals, clothing, and books, and ran up a debt balance of about $8,784 on an account opened when\nhe was unemployed (\u00b6 1.b). When he was no longer able to make payments on the account,\nApplicant sent a letter to the creditor asking for patience until he found work. He even forwarded\na copy of his retainer letter from his attorney, but the creditor closed the account in about July 1998.\nApplicant discovered the account had been closed when he tried to use his credit card for a purchase\nand it was denied.\nIn September 1998, he began working as a senior research engineer for the developer of a\nsoftware business card reader program at an annual salary of $65,000 to $75,000.  Hired to lead the\nredesign of the core software algorithms for the business-card reader, he arrived with \u201cconsiderable\nrecommendations\u201d that were borne out in product innovations. Applicant relied on public\ntransportation to get to work and did not own a vehicle during this time. While he had taken the job\nwith the understanding that it was permanent, he was laid off in May 1999 when the project finished.\nApplicant did not make any payments on the $8,784 debt because he was still paying his attorney\nto resolve his employment dispute with the federal agency.  He paid $58.74 on August 24, 1998, and\n1\n$1,219.98 on October 26, 1998, to the D.C. area attorney he had retained.\nApplicant lived off unemployment benefits and savings until August 2000. On June 21, 1999,\nApplicant paid a local legal firm $5,000 to represent him as his other attorney had not yet filed a\n\nApplicant testified he did not know for sure whether the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b had been charged off. He attributed\n2\nhis understanding to knowledge of how the system of unsecured credit works, that debts get charged off after six months\nafter the last transaction. (Tr. 114)\n4\nclaim on his behalf and he wanted a second opinion. In late 1999, Applicant elected not to pursue\nany further a claim against his former employer.\nApplicant took an extended vacation from November 1999 to April 2000 to Thailand, the\nnative country of his future spouse. They married in the U.S. in December 2000.\nFrom mid-August 2000 to mid-January 2003, Applicant was employed as a senior software\nengineer for a content distribution network Internet company. Described as \u201cvery serious, intense\u201d\nby his supervisor, Applicant was very reliable even in performing the most complex work. With an\nannual salary that started at $85,000, Applicant began reading publications such as Money magazine\nand the Wall Street Journal in about early 2001 for information as to how best to settle his\ndelinquent consumer credit debt. He decided to make no payments on his old debt because he\nunderstood it would cause more harm to his credit record than if he did nothing:\nBecause it would stay on your, because on credit histories, they go for a seven year\nperiod and they have to be taken off by law, and they, the clock starts at the last\ntransaction that you had with them and if I had repaid them in 2001-02, the debt, that\nwould have stayed, my belief was that it would have stayed on my credit for another\nseven years beyond that, instead of being taken off in two years or three years.  (Tr.\n2\n61)\nApplicant did not know whether the debt had been charged off or sent for collection at that time. He\nmade no effort to contact the creditor to ascertain its status. With salary increases to just over\n$100,000 as of January 2003, Applicant managed to accumulate savings of $100,000 or more during\nthis employment. Applicant did not incur any new consumer credit delinquency during this period,\nand he used public transportation to commute to work.\nApplicant was laid off in mid-January 2003. He remained current in his living expenses even\nthough he was unemployed for most of the year. In early December 2003, Applicant began working\nfor a defense contractor as a lead engineer at an annual salary of $110,000. Applicant bought a car,\npaying cash, so that he could get to work. \nOn December 17, 2003, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) for a\nsecurity clearance. Applicant indicated in response to question 32 concerning whether he had ever\nhad a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, that his clearance had been\nremoved \u201cextralegally, denying due process\u201d in December 1996 in retaliation for reporting improper\nconduct to a federal agency Inspector General. In response to question 35 concerning any\nrepossessions, he disclosed the April 1998 repossession of his automobile on which he had owed\n$12,000, adding that he had openly communicated with the lien holder and had attempted to sell the\nvehicle; that the attorney, to whom he paid about $20,000 to address due process claims and recoup\nlost wages from his former federal employer, never filed a claim on his behalf. He responded \u201cNo\u201d\nto questions 38 (any financial delinquencies over 180 days in the last seven years) and 39 (currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debt).\n\nThe May 17, 2005, credit report lists a revolving credit card account, opened in September 1998, and charged\n3\noff with a debt balance of $1,884. There is a second listing under the same account number, as a collection account\nopened in April 2001 with a past due balance of $1,885. (Ex. 3)\n5\nBy April 21, 2005, his employer had been acquired by another defense contractor. Applicant\nreviewed the SF 86 completed in December 2003, and added information to, or in some instances\nchanged, his previous responses. He changed his answer to question 38 to \u201cYes\u201d and added, \u201cIn\n1998, see remarks in item 35. Credit rating prior to 1998 was excellent and have incurred no new\ndebts since 1998 credit issues. Arising from job loss and legal fees.\u201d Under the section for general\nremarks (question 43), Applicant added, \u201cAlways strive to be honest, ethical, reasonable, and\nresponsible in all areas of my life. Regrettably the adverse items in 1998 (re: credit rating) were\nhelpless result of false claims and denial of due process in 1996.\u201d \nA combined credit report from two credit reporting agencies indicated on May 17, 2005, that\nApplicant had two bad debts that were unpaid: a credit card debt of $1,885 on an account likely\nopened in September 1998 placed for collection and later charged off by the assignee (\u00b6 1.a),  and\n3\na credit card debt of $8,784 on an account opened in November 1997 and later charged off with no\nactivity since July 1998 (\u00b6 1.b).\nDOHA subsequently sent Applicant a financial interrogatory, asking him to verify the current\nstatus of those two debts and any other delinquent/outstanding debts that he owed. Included with his\nAugust 10, 2006, response to the interrogatory was a letter dated August 9, 2006, in which Applicant\nstated, in part:\nI am pleased to report that the two debts for which status updates have been requested\nhave both expired as legal debts. The \u2018[creditor omitted]; $1885' account was charged\noff in April 1999, and the \u2018[creditor omitted]; $8784' was charged off in March 1999.\nState law dismisses such accounts from financial obligation six years after last-\ntransaction dates; thus the former was relieved in April 2005, the latter in March\n2005.\nAs indicated in my enclosed Personal Financial Statement, I do have more than\nsufficient funds to cover any valid, active account balances, if it were deemed\nappropriate to do so. Yet, I have been advised that since both items have fallen off\nof my credit report already, that any transaction on old defunct accounts would add\nnegative credit information onto my currently clean credit history for another seven\nyears.\nHe furnished a copy of his March 2006 credit report showing all accounts were in good standing, as\nwell as a personal financial statement indicating that he had sufficient funds to repay his debts. He\nestimated a joint net monthly remainder of $7,550, and $260,000 in bank savings.\nOn November 27, 2006, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant alleging Financial\nConsiderations concerns related to his failure to pay the $1,885 (\u00b6 1.a) and $8,784 (\u00b6 1.b) charged\noff debts. Applicant claims to not recognize the debt in \u00b6 1.a, but he also has made no effort to\ncontact the creditor to determine whether it was his debt or wrongly listed on his credit report. He\nmade no effort to repay the $8,784 debt because it was no longer legally enforceable and he wanted\n\n6\nto maintain a clean credit record, in part so there would be no issues if he and his spouse decide to\nchange residences.\nIn Fall 2006, Applicant and his spouse had their first child. Applicant\u2019s spouse, who earned\n$36,572.75 in 2006 as a food server for a hotel, reduced her hours to three days per week. Her\nincome decreased by about one quarter, but Applicant\u2019s salary had increased to just over $120,000\nas of Spring 2007. Applicant and his spouse take turns caring for their child. They share the car and\ndo not spend extravagantly.  Discretionary funds are placed in a savings account. As of March 2007,\nApplicant\u2019s take home pay was $2,799.35 for 80 hours of work. He and his spouse had a joint online\nsavings account with a balance of $314,172.21 as of mid-April 2007. Applicant had retirement assets\nof $14,652.07 from his employment with the Internet company from 2000 to 2003. He participates\nin his current employer\u2019s savings and investment plan. The value of his account, $77,132.33 as of\nthe end of 2006, had increased in value to about $100,000 as of May 2007.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. Applicant was\nforced to resign from his job with a federal agency, effective late January 1997, in lieu of being fired\n(\u201cmade to resign using threats of blacklisting me, essentially.\u201d Tr. 37). He elected to challenge the\nloss of his clearance and federal employment, a decision that cost him emotionally and financially.\n\n7\nAccumulated savings went to pay for travel back and forth to look for legal counsel in the\nWashington, D.C. area. About ten months into his unemployment, he opened a credit card account\non which he incurred a debt balance of about $8,784 (\u00b6 1.b). In April 1998, his car was repossessed\nfor failure to make timely payments. Yet, the following month, he paid $10,000 to an attorney to\nrepresent him in his suit against the agency.  In September 1998, he began working at a job that paid\nbetween $65,000 and $75,000 annually, but made no effort to repay the $8,784 debt as he was still\npaying legal fees. In October 1998, he paid an additional $1,219.34 to the attorney representing his\ninterests against the federal agency. According to his May 2005 credit report (Ex. 3), he opened\nanother credit card account in September 1998 on which he incurred a $1,884 balance (\u00b6 1.a) that\nwas placed for collection. Shortly after he was laid off in May 1999, he paid another attorney $5,000\nin June 1999 for an opinion as to proceeding on the merits against the federal agency, knowing that\nhe owed at least the creditor in \u00b6 1.b if not both creditors. In late 1999, Applicant decided to no\nlonger pursue the matter against the agency. He took a lengthy vacation to Thailand from November\n1999 to April 2000 when he was unemployed, and aware of at least one unpaid delinquent credit card\nbalance (\u00b6 1.b) on his credit record.\nApplicant now claims to have no knowledge of the $1,885 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, he\nhas not successfully met his burden of showing that the debt, which appears on his May 2005 credit\nreport, was not his debt (see \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue). When\nApplicant answered the DOHA financial interrogatory, he did not deny that the debt had been\nincurred by him. Rather, he challenged that it was legally enforceable since it had been charged off\nin April 1999. He provided no documentation showing that the debt was reported on his credit record\nin error. He has not disputed with any of the credit bureaus the inclusion of the debt on his record.\nDisqualifying conditions \u00b6 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and \u00b6 19(c) a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations, apply to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.\nThe absence of any new delinquent debt since 1999 and the negative impact of his lengthy\nperiods of unemployment (26 of the 36 months during the three-year period from 1997 through 1999\nalone) merit consideration of mitigating conditions \u00b6 20(a), the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \u00b6 20(b), the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Irrespective of whether\nApplicant had a legitimate claim against the federal agency, it is clear that his financial delinquencies\nare directly attributed to the loss of this job and his efforts to redress what he thought was unjust\nretaliation by the agency.\nThe concern in this case rather is not with the incurring of the debt, but rather with\nApplicant\u2019s failure to take reasonable efforts to address the delinquency. From September 1998 to\nMay 1999, he was gainfully employed at an annual salary of between $65,000 and $75,000 per year.\nEven with the $5,000 paid to an attorney in mid-May 1999, he should have been able to make some\npayment on his delinquent debt. His May 1999 layoff was unforeseen (see \u00b6 20(b)), but the evidence\nalso shows that he took a lengthy vacation to his spouse\u2019s native Thailand, likely incurring some\ntravel expenses, from November 1999 to April 2000. Although he began working as a senior\n\n8\nsoftware engineer at an annual salary of $85,000 in August 2000, he did not contact his creditors.\nInstead, he started reading financial magazines where he learned that bad credit would remain on his\ncredit report for seven years after the last transaction. Motivated from self-interest rather than a sense\nof obligation, he did nothing and the debts were subsequently dropped from his credit report.\nAs of August 2006, Applicant estimated he had $7,550 in monthly net disposable income and\n$260,000 in bank savings. Even if he underestimated some of his monthly expenses, such as\ngroceries where he indicated only an expense of $175, he was in a financial position to repay his\ndelinquent debt in full. Yet, he indicated to DOHA, \u201cI am pleased to report that the two items for\nwhich status updates have been requested have both expired as legal debts.\u201d (Ex. 2) Since the debts\nin \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b had fallen off his credit report, any transaction on his old accounts would add\nnegative credit information onto his clean credit history. Even as of his hearing, he showed no intent\nto resolve his old debts as it would negatively affect his currently good credit rating that he wanted\nto maintain in case he and his spouse should decide to move from their present apartment. As noted\nby the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR 01-09691, decided on March 27, 2003, \u201ceven if a delinquent\ndebt is legally unenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts\nand circumstances surroundings an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt\nin a timely manner.\u201d\nApplicant is not at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds since he clearly is not\nfinancially overextended. However, failure to satisfy debts can indicate a lack of judgment or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. The Government must be assured that those\nindividuals granted access can be counted on to put their fiduciary obligations ahead of their personal\ninterest and Applicant\u2019s handling of his financial matters cast considerable doubt as to whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. AG \u00b6 2(a). Each\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and\nadjudication policy. Directive \u00b6 6.3. Under the whole-person concept, Applicant has shown that he\ncan live within his means. He and his spouse live frugally, sharing one car and incurring little\nconsumer debt. Yet, Applicant\u2019s attitude toward his old accounts in troubling in its implication for\nwhat he would do if faced with a situation where doing the right thing would be personally\ninconvenient or costly. He fails to show sufficient reform (\u00b6 2(a)(6), the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes) when he continues to justify or rationalize\nhis failure to pay for the goods and services that he enjoyed, overstating that he needs a clean credit\nrating even to get an apartment (\u201cthat is a criteria for survivability\u201d).

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: Applicant, a 27-year-old employee, began working as an engineer for a defense contractor (Employer #1) in State #1 in November 2004 and also completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86). In 2006 another company bought the company where she worked initially, so the name changed. But she is in the same job. (Exhibit 1; TR 21-22; 42) Applicant was born in the Macao, when it was a part of Portugal. Initially, Applicant and 3 all her family had passports from Portugal as they lived in Macao. She emigrated to the U.S. in 1997 as her father got a Green Card through a lottery in Macao and brought the entire family. Applicant 4 received her education in the U.S. along with her younger sister. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2003 and was issued a U.S. passport. Applicant was granted a B.S. in engineering from a state university in June 2003.

She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2003, is recommended for\na security clearance by her corporate superiors, and is fully integrated into U.S. society.  One sister\nis a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Since1997, all her immediate family members have had a Green Card.\nAll are seeking U.S. citizenship except for her father and grandmother who are citizens of China and\nresidents of Macao. I conclude it is improbable that foreign pressure on her relatives could create a\nsituation that could result in the compromise of classified information as Applicant attests she would\nreport any attempt to the appropriate U.S. official.  Also, Applicant asked that her foreign passport\nbe destroyed in 2006; so foreign preference concerns are similarly mitigated. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on October 18, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over foreign\n1\ninfluence (Guideline B) in paragraph 1 and over foreign preference (Guideline C) in paragraph 2\nbased on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  issued on December 29, 2005, and\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.   Applicant replied to the\nSOR allegations in an Answer notarized on November 12, 2006 and again on December 7, 2006,\nwhen she requested a hearing.\nOn January 30, 2007, Department Counsel noted the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to another judge on February 5, 2007. Subsequently, a Notice of Hearing, issued on\nFebruary 22, 2007, set the matter for March 8, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works and\nlives.  The case was re-assigned to me on March 5, 2007, because of the unavailability of the\nprevious judge.  A Stipulation was reached and signed by the Government on January 30, 2007, and\nby Applicant on February 19, 2007 that Government Exhibits 1 and 2 were admissible; consequently,\nthey were admitted into evidence based on that stipulation.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 9-10) In addition,\nDepartment Counsel offered into evidence a January 30, 2007, memorandum for Administrative\nNotice outlining concerns over China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau and attached sixteen\nadditional Documents for Administrative Notice (AN): Exhibits I-XVI.  The documents were\naccepted as Applicant offered no objection.  (TR 10-12)  Applicant testified and offered three\nexhibits which were admitted into evidence. (Exhibits A, B, C) At the close of the evidence,\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence as follows: \n\u2022\nSOR 1.c. \u201cYour grandmother is a citizen of China and resides in Macao.\u201d\n\u2022\nSOR 1.f. \u201cYou have a cousin who is a citizen of Canada and resides in Taiwan.\u201d  \n\n       Macau, formerly a Chinese territory under Portuguese administration, became a Special Administrative\n3\nRegion (SAR) of the People\u2019s Republic of China in December 1999 with a high degree of autonomy except\nin areas of defense and foreign policy as it retains its own currency, laws, and border controls. (AN XVI)\n       A \u201cGreen Card\u201d holder indicates an individual is a lawful permanent residence (LPR) of the U.S.\n4\n  \n3\n\u2022\nSOR 1.g, \u201cYou have an uncle who is a citizen of Canada and resides in Hong Kong.\u201d  \n(TR 50) Applicant did not object, so the motion to amend was granted.  (TR 50-51) The transcript\n(TR) was received on March15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, a 27-year-old employee, began working as an engineer for a defense contractor\n(Employer #1) in State #1 in November 2004 and also completed a Security Clearance Application\n(Standard Form 86). In 2006 another company bought the company where she worked initially, so\nthe name changed.  But she is in the same job.  (Exhibit 1; TR 21-22; 42)\nApplicant was born in the Macao,  when it was a part of Portugal. Initially, Applicant and\n3\nall her family had passports from Portugal as they lived in Macao.  She emigrated to the U.S. in 1997\nas her father got a Green Card  through a lottery in Macao and brought the entire family.  Applicant\n4\nreceived her education in the U.S. along with her younger sister.  She became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in May 2003 and was issued a U.S. passport. Applicant was granted a B.S. in engineering\nfrom a state university in June 2003.  (Exhibit 1; TR 43-45) \nForeign Preference \nBefore she became a naturalized U.S. citizen and had a U.S. passport, Applicant visited\nMacao from December 1998 to January 1999.  In order to go again, in January 2002,  she renewed\nher passport from Portugal in October 2002 to return to Macao and to visit her grandmother from\nDecember 2002 to January 2003.   The passport did not expire until October 2007.  However, she\ndid not use it after she became a U.S. citizen in May 2003 and had a U.S. passport.  Applicant had\nthe security supervisor at her company destroy her passport from Portugal in November 2006 by\nshredding, an approved method.  (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 23-25; 28-29; Exhibit A)  \nWhile initially reluctant to surrender her Portuguese passport as she was not sure if she could\nstay in Macao with her U.S. passport, once that issue was clarified, she had no problem surrendering\nher passport to her security officer. (TR 44)  She destroyed her foreign passport in order to meet the\nrequirements for a U.S. security clearance.  She no longer considers herself a citizen of Portugal.\nShe has no intent to return to Macao, but has not formally renounced her citizenship.  (TR 33)\nForeign Influence \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s mother, her brother, and her elder sister who were born in Macao and are citizens\nof Portugal now live in the U.S.  They have Green Cards and have applied or are in the process of\napplying to become U.S. citizens.  (Exhibit 1; TR 20-21; 25-26; 29-30) \n\u2022\nHer brother initially came to the U.S. in 1997 and got a Green Card, but he returned to\nMacao with his parents as he was too young to stay in the U.S. alone.  He returned with the\nmother in 2001 and now attends school in the U.S.  He last visited Macao in 2004.  He is\nseeking U.S. citizenship.  (TR 39; 45; 47-48)\n\u2022 \nBorn in Macao, her younger sister became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2003 and is a\ncomputer engineer.  (Exhibit 1; TR 20-21; 25-26; 29-30; 35-36; 46) \n\u2022\nHer older sister was studying in England at the time the rest of the family immigrated to the\nU.S., but she has lived in the U.S. since 2000.  She is a citizen of Portugal, but intends to\nbecome a U.S. citizen.  She is married to a U.S. citizen and works in human resources for a\nU.S. company.   (Exhibit 1; TR 20-21; 25-26; 29-30; 35-37; 45) She went to Macao in\nNovember 2006 to visit family and to renew her Green Card.  (TR 38; 45)\n\u2022\nHer father was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d); he is a citizen of Portugal.\nLater after receiving his Green Card, her father returned to Macao in 1997 to live and work;\nhe is the bank manager of a private bank and plans to remain in Macao until he retires.\n(Exhibit 1; TR 20-21; 25-26; 27-28; 29-30; 47)  He visits the U.S. annually. (TR 39)\n\u2022\nHer grandmother is a citizen of China and resides in Macao. She visited the U.S.  in 2004 for\nthe older sister\u2019s wedding.  (Exhibit 2; TR 39)  Applicant\u2019s father and grandmother continue\nto live in a house he has owns in Macao. Applicant has no anticipation on inheriting the\nhouse as it would go to her mother.  Her grandmother is 86 and was a housewife her entire\nlife; she does not have a Green Card in the U.S.  Applicant cannot sponsor her for one.\nApplicant talks to them about once a week and last visited them in Macao in 2004 on her\nU.S. passport. (TR 30-33)  Since her grandmother and her father live in Macao, she once\nthought that she might have to go back to Macao to take care of them; but if she went to\nMacao, she would use her U.S. passport. (Exhibit 2; TR43-44) \n\u2022\nHer mother  returned to Macao for a job in 2001, but Applicant and her sister stayed in the\nU.S. to study.  Applicant now lives with her mother in the U.S.  The mother works as a part-\ntime tutor for a school.  (Exhibit 1; TR 20-21; 25-26; 29-30.35) Her mother is in touch with\nher husband once a week by telephone and he sends her $5,000 quarterly to pay school\ntuition for Applicant\u2019s brother. The mother last visited Macao in 2004.  (TR 37-38)\n\u2022\nApplicant also disclosed cousins who have foreign citizenship.  (Exhibit 2)  She has a cousin\nwho is a citizen of Canada and resides in Taiwan; she works as an engineer for a private\ncompany. (Answer; TR 40) \n\u2022\nShe has  an uncle, her father\u2019s brother, who is a citizen of Canada and resides in Hong Kong;\nhowever, she rarely has contact with him. (Answer; TR 41)\nApplicant stated she has no relationship with China: at the time she lived in Macao it was a\n\n5\npart of Portugal. While Macao was a colony of Portugal, at no time did she travel to Portugal.  (TR\n20-21; 25-26; 29-30) When she visited Macao and Hong Kong in December 2002 and Macao in\n2004 she was never approach by anyone from a foreign government or military organization for\ninformation.  (TR 29)  None of her relatives have ever been approached by anyone seeking\ninformation about Applicant. If she were every approached, she would contact the FBI.  (TR 41-42)\nReferences\nThe engineer analysis supervisor who has known Applicant for two years assessed her as \u201ca\ndedicated, honest, responsible and professional acting individual.\u201d He recommended and supported\nher application for a security clearance.  (Exhibit B)\nAnother corporate official who has known Applicant for two and one half years declared that\nApplicant provides modeling and simulation support to his structural design team.  He assessed her\nas always displaying \u201ca high degree of integrity, dependability, and ethics.\u201d  He recommended her\nfor a security clearance.  (Exhibit C) \nIs the foreign country known to target United States citizens \nto obtain protected information? \nThe Government provided for Administrative Notice several documents regarding China\nincluding a State Department Background Note on China, a  Consular Information Sheet, a country\nreport on human rights practices from 2005, a Select Committee of the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives report, an annual report on foreign economic collection and industrial espionage,\nand an Intelligence Threat Handbook that included a section on China (\u201cThreat Handbook\u201d).  (AN\nI to VII) The Threat Handbook observed, \u201cThere is no evidence that the PRC considers Chinese-\nAmericans to be more vulnerable to approach than any other group.\u201d The PRC uses \u201cwhatever\nfeelings of obligation the targeted individual may have toward China, family members in China, old\nfriends in China, etc.\u201d  PRC\u2019s approach is \u201cnot to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability but to\nappeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help China out in some way.\u201d  (AN VII at 21) She also provided\na Background Note on Taiwan, a Congressional Research Service (CRS) issues brief on Taiwan,\nand press releases from U.S. Attorney\u2019s office on a Taiwan related prosecution.  (AN VIII to XII)\nShe also provided a Background Note on Hong Kong, a Consular Information Sheet (AN XIII to\nXIV) She also provided a Background Note on Macau as well as a Consular Information Sheet.  (AN\nXV & XVI)\nDepartment Counsel argued that security concerns exist because of Macao\u2019s relationship with\nChina and China\u2019s poor human rights records, its possession of strategic nuclear weapons and\nmissiles, and its having actively targeted the U.S. with legal and illegal intelligence-gathering\nprograms for economic intelligence.  (TR 53-54)\nPOLICIES\n\n6\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or\nabsence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the\nevidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth\nbelow:\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n6. The concern:  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign\ninterest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of\nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \nGuideline C:  Foreign Preference\n 9. The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the\nprovisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense\ndetermination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence\nApplicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns over possible foreign influence\nraised by Applicant's close ties of affection to citizens of China who live in Macao, her father, her\ngrandmother, her cousin who lives in Taiwan, and her uncle who lives in Hong Kong as well as her\nsister, brother, and mother who all have Green Cards and live in the U.S.  One sister has already\nbecome a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003.  The security concern under Guideline B, Foreign\n\n       7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  \n5\n(a.)  contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or a person  who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (d.) sharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; (e.)  a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry. . . .which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\n       8.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n6\n(a.)  the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\n(c.) contact and correspondence with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood\nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\n(e.)  The individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of\ncontacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups or organizations from a foreign country;\n(f.)  the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are\nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the\nindividual.\n7\nInfluence, requires an assessment under disqualifying condition (DC) 7.(a.) of the security risk  that\n5\nmay exist when an individual's family member \u201cis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d   Applicant has visited her relatives in Macao, but only on a limited and infrequent basis.\nShe never experienced any pressure that raised a security concern.  Given the fact that her father\nworks for a private sector bank and her grandmother is a housewife, they seem an unlikely target of\nthe government of China.  Applicant has limited contact with her cousin in Taiwan and her uncle in\nHong Kong.  While she lives with her mother and has frequent contact with her sister and brother\nwho live in the U.S., they are all Green Card holders and similarly pose a unlikely risk.  Applicant\nreported they have never been pressured for information about Applicant.  Applicant\u2019s father does\nown his own home in Macao which could raise a security concern under AG (7. e.)  A substantial\nbusiness, financial, or property interest in a foreign country. . . .which could subject the individual\nto heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  On the other hand, Applicant has no\nanticipation of inheriting it as it would go to her mother.  \nWhile I have considered these security concerns, I conclude Applicant has presented evidence\nto meet the burden of mitigating  those circumstances either under the mitigating conditions (MC)\n6\noutlined in the revised guidelines or by a whole person analysis.  Applicant's family ties to China\nwhich present the largest concern are her father and grandmother in Macao with whom she has\nintermittent visits and conversations.  One notable element is assessing these security concerns is the\nfact that Applicant\u2019s father and other members of her immediate family (except for her grandmother)\nhave had Green Cards since her father won the lottery in 1997.  While her mother has frequent\ncontacts with her husband in Macao, Applicant reported no evidence of any foreign duress or\ninfluence on Applicant and/or her immediate family in Macao, Taiwan, or Hong Kong.  On balance,\nApplicant is not dependent on the money her father sends her mother as it is used for her brother\u2019s\ntuition, not for her benefit.\n\n8\nThus, despite the concerns over China\u2019s economic espionage and human rights record, I\nconclude any risk would appear to be slight and clearly manageable under MC (a.).  Applicant is a\nU.S. citizen who was educated here.  Her family members who live here have Green Cards as does\nher father who lives in Macao.  Notably, the Threat Handbook indicates that PRC\u2019s approach is \u201cnot\nto try to exploit a perceived vulnerability but to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help China out\nin some way.\u201d  (AN VII at 21) Given Applicant\u2019s deep ties to the U.S., there is no evidence that she\nwould have any motivation to \u201chelp China out\u201d by her efforts.  Moreover, Applicant made evident\nthat at any hint of any coercion or pressure on herself or his family, she would immediate report such\ncoercion to the FBI.  Thus, I find  there is no substantial likelihood that she would be subject to\nduress merely because of these family ties. \nAlso I have evaluated her under the whole person adjudicative process guidelines:  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (AG 2. Adjudication Process)\nSignificantly, Applicant is recommended for a security clearance by corporate officials who\nhave known her for over two years.  The engineer analysis supervisor assessed her as \u201ca dedicated,\nhonest, responsible and professional acting individual.\u201d Another corporate official stated that\nApplicant has always displayed \u201ca high degree of integrity, dependability, and ethics.\u201d \nLooking at all of these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has overcome  foreign influence\nsecurity concerns.  Given her strong and lengthy ties to the U.S. since she has lived in the U.S. since\n1997 and became a U.S. naturalized citizen in 2003, there is limited potential for coercion,\nexploitation or duress.  Since Applicant came to the U.S., she has seen no indicators that the\ngovernment of China has tried to exploit her relationship with her relatives in Macao, Taiwan or\nHong Kong.  If she did, she would report any attempts to U.S. officials.  After review all of the\nevidence I conclude, there is little  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress on\nApplicant or her family members. \nSecurity clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's security eligibility\nin light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security\ndeterminations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Acts indicative of foreign influence warrant\ncareful scrutiny.  After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines,\nI conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue pressure on\nApplicant, so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1\nand subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.g. in Applicant's favor.\nForeign Preference\n\n9\nUnder Guideline C, foreign preference security concerns are raised when an individual acts\nin such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States: he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.  In this case, Applicant renewed her passport from Portugal in January 2002 before she\nbecame a U.S. citizen and traveled to Macau to visit.  Raising security concerns is the fact that she\ncontinued to possess it after she became a U.S. citizen in 2003.  These actions raised concerns under\nAG 10 (a.) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after become a U.S.\ncitizen:  (1) Possession of a current foreign passport.  However, once she became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in 2003 and got a U.S. passport, she used her U.S. passport for travel. \nUltimately, understanding the security significance of having a foreign passport, she\nvoluntarily had her foreign passport shredded by a security official in November 2006.\nConsequently, she fell within the mitigating condition AG 11 (e): the passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.  \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether\nthere is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time\nshe renewed her passport.  Based on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and review of her as a whole\nperson, I conclude that Guideline C, allegation 2.a., in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline C\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance to the Applicant.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\n\n10\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 29, 2006\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (criminal conduct),\nGuideline H (drug involvement) and Guideline E (personal conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense\neffective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was\nissued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 14, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 13, 2007. With the consent\nof the parties, I convened a hearing on March 19, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government\noffered three exhibits that were marked as GE 1-3 and admitted without objections. Applicant\ntestified on his behalf and offered three exhibits that were marked as AE A-C and were admitted\nwithout objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 26 years old and has been employed as a repair technician for a federal\ncontractor since December 2004. He is divorced and remarried in 2004. He and his wife have a\nyoung son. He earned a General Equivalency Diploma and later an associate\u2019s degree from college.\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct beginning on August 25, 1998, when he was\narrested and charged with burglary of a vehicle. He and friends decided to burglarize a vehicle. The\npolice were called and his friends fled the scene. Applicant\u2019s testimony was evasive at first, but he\ndid admit he knew his friends intended to break into the vehicle and he acted as the \u201clookout.\u201d  He\n1\npled guilty and the adjudication was deferred. \n\nTr. 60-65.\n2\nTr. 69-70.\n3\nTr. 72.\n4\nTr. 83.\n5\nTr. 85.\n6\n3\nOn July 13, 1999, Applicant was charged with consumption of alcohol by a minor. Applicant\nwas drinking alcohol under age while at a party. He was taken into custody. He was issued a citation\nand paid the fine. Three months later on October 18, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with\nfelony possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, and possession of marijuana. He was leaving\na party and was stopped by the police. He stated he had less than a gram of cocaine and one\nmarijuana cigarette.  He was taken into custody, retained counsel and pled guilty to the charge. He\n2\nreceived deferred adjudication for two years and was placed on probation.3\nApproximately eight months later, on May 20, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith felony possession of a controlled substance, marijuana. He was still in his deferred adjudication\nstatus and on probation from his last offense. He pled guilty and his adjudication was again deferred.\nHis probation was extended until 2001. He was required to meet with a probation officer and\nparticipate in a drug testing program. When asked if he ever tested positive for drugs while on\nprobation and taking drugs tests he stated: \u201cI believe one time.\u201d  He attended court ordered\n4\nrehabilitation counseling and attended Narcotics Anonymous.\nOn October 8, 2002, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor.\nHe pled guilty, adjudication was again deferred, and he was sentenced to one year probation. Terms\nof his probation were to not get in any trouble and refrain from alcohol and drug use.5\nApplicant was arrested on May 18, 2003, and charged with two counts of\npurchasing/furnishing alcohol to a minor. Applicant violated his probation from his previous\nconviction. He pled guilty, adjudication was deferred, and he was sentenced to one year probation,\nand was required to pay a fine and court costs. Applicant brought two minors to a party where\nalcohol was present. He was taking them home when he was stopped by the police. Both minors\nwere intoxicated. Applicant stated he was not intoxicated and did not purchase alcohol for the\nminors. Applicant sought counsel and pled guilty to the charge.6\nWhile on probation Applicant was arrested on April 16, 2004, and charged with (1) unlawful\npossession of a firearm-a felony, (2) prohibited weapons, and (3) possession of marijuana. Applicant\nlived in an apartment with his wife and two other people. The police were called by neighbors due\nto excessive noise. Applicant\u2019s wife permitted the police to search their apartment. The police\nconfiscated an AR-15 assault rifle, armor piercing bullets, and marijuana. Applicant stated the gun\nbelonged to his wife and the bullets were not armor piercing, but ballistic silver tipped that he\npurchased at Wal-Mart. He stated he was aware that there was marijuana in the apartment, but it did\nnot belong to him. He stated it belonged to one of the other roommates. Applicant admitted he\n\nTr. 87.\n7\nTr. 103; AE B.\n8\nTr. 104-105.\n9\nGE 1, Question 27.\n10\nTr. 106.\n11\nAnswer p. 2.\n12\nTr. 106.\n13\nTr. 75.\n14\nGE 1, Question 27.\n15\nAnswer p. 2\n16\nTr. 77.\n17\n4\npurchased the bullets and the firearm was registered under his wife\u2019s name.  Applicant was on\n7\nprobation when he was arrested. The charges were later dismissed. \nOn April 1, 2005, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated. He admitted he had\nbeen drinking alcohol, and was driving, but claimed he was not intoxicated. He pled not guilty and\nthe case was continued several times. The charge was never adjudicated. Applicant filed a speedy\ntrial motion and the case was dismissed based on the motion.8\nWhen questioned about when was the last time Applicant used marijuana he stated it was\nwhen he lived in his apartment in 2004.  On Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) he\n9\nlisted under Question 27 that his last use was May 20, 2000.  He admitted the date he listed on the\n10\nSCA was not true.  In his answer to the SOR Applicant stated \u201cI admit that I used marijuana, at least\n11\n30 times, from about August 1998 until at least October 2002.\u201d  Applicant then changed his\n12\ntestimony and stated his last use was in 2002 and he was confused.  Applicant\u2019s testimony was not\n13\ncredible.\nApplicant testified he first began using marijuana in 1995-1996, when he was in high\nschool.  Applicant listed in his SCA that he first began using marijuana in 1998.  He confirmed this\n14\n15\ndate a second time in his answer to the SOR.  He explanation for the discrepancy was that he\n16\naccidentally put down the wrong date.  He confirmed the correct date to be 1995-1996. Applicant\u2019s\n17\ntestimony conflicts with his sworn statement and admissions on his SCA.\nQuestion 27 of the SCA asked Applicant to list any illegal use of a controlled substance since\nthe age of 16 or in the last seven years which ever is shorter. The question then lists examples of\ncontrolled substances, including marijuana and cocaine, among other illegal substances. Applicant\nlisted his marijuana use from August 1, 1998 to May 20, 2000. He failed to list he had also used\ncocaine on two occasions. His explanation was that he thought the question only referred to\nmarijuana. His explanation was not credible.\n\nApplicant\u2019s inconsistencies and failure to provide correct information on this question was not alleged in the\n18\nSOR and will not be considered for disqualifying purposes. However, Applicant\u2019s inconsistent testimony will be\nconsidered when determining his credibility and in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d\nAE A.\n19\nTr. 62\n20\nApplicant also admitted he purchased cocaine once and marijuana. He purchased the drugs for himself and\n21\nothers. He failed to list this activity in response to Question 29 of the SCA which requires he list any illegal purchase,\ntransfer, or sale, among other things, of an illegal drug. I have not considered this information for disqualifying purposes,\nbut have considered it when determining the Applicant\u2019s credibility and when analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d\nTr. 93.\n22\nTr. 89-96. This information is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but is considered when determining\n23\nApplicant\u2019s credibly and in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d\n5\nQuestion 24 of the SCA asks Applicant if he has ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffenses related to alcohol or drugs. Applicant listed his offenses dated October 8, 2002 and May 20,\n2000. He did not list the charges from April 16, 2004 for possession of marijuana, May 18, 2003,\nfurnishing/purchasing alcohol to a minor, October 18, 1999, felony possession of a controlled\nsubstance, and July 13, 1999, consumption of alcohol by a minor.  Applicant conducted an internet\n18\nsearch through a commercial company to determine what records they had that listed his offenses.19\nHe claimed this was the document he used to provide the information requested in Question 24. This\ndocument was incomplete, in that it did not list all of Applicant\u2019s arrests, charges and convictions.\nAt one point in the hearing when he became confused as to which charge was being discussed and\nrequested to speak with his attorney, Applicant stated \u201cma\u2019am, you\u2019ve got to understand. There\u2019s\nbeen so many charges.\u201d  Applicant was aware he had more than the three arrests (an additional\n20\narrest was included in answering Question 26) he listed on his SCA and failed to report them.  \n21\nIn response to Question 26, which asked Applicant-to list any arrests, charges or convictions\nof any offense(s) not previously listed. He was required to report any information regardless of\nwhether the record was sealed or otherwise stricken from the record. Applicant listed his 1998\nburglary offense, but failed to list the offenses on April 14, 2004, May 18, 2003, October 18, 1999\nand July 13, 1999. Applicant\u2019s explanation was the same as above for why he failed to list all of his\noffenses. He stated it was not his intention to deceive the government. He had his father assist him\nin filling out the SCA and it took him approximately two weeks to complete the application.\nApplicant listed on his SCA that he lived at the same address from August 1, 1995, to the\npresent. This information was not correct. During his testimony Applicant admitted he had lived in\nan apartment for approximately three years. His explanation for the incorrect information was that\nhe was listing his \u201cbilling\u201d address.  Applicant stated he understood the importance of providing\n22\naccurate information on his SCA and it would be used for the purpose of doing a background check.\nHe also affirmed the importance of providing his correct residence.23\nApplicant admitted he made poor decisions and foolish mistakes in his past. He testified that\nhe was hanging around with the wrong crowd and has now changed his ways. He no longer\nassociates with his old friends. He has changed his lifestyle and is a devoted husband and father who\n\nAE C.\n24\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n25\nId. at 527.\n26\nExec.

The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n30\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n31\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.32\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\n\n7\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nGuideline H-Drug Involvement is a concern because use of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nBased on all the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) 31(a) (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and 31 (b) (allegations or admissions of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted),\napply. Applicant has pled guilty and been convicted of a series of crimes beginning in 1998. The\nconvictions include drug offenses, burglary and providing alcohol to minors. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) 32 (a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and CC MC 32 (d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement). \n\n8\nApplicant has exhibited a pattern of misconduct, rules violations and criminal conduct\nbeginning in 1998. His latest charge was dismissed because the case took too long to come to trial.\nApplicant admitted he was drinking and driving, but claims he was not intoxicated. This is risky\nconduct and exhibits questionable judgment for a person who states he has changed his ways and\nhas a long history of criminal conduct. The same is true for the charges that were dismissed regarding\nthe weapons and possession of marijuana. This offense was in April of 2004. Although the charges\nwere dismissed, it demonstrates very risky behavior on the part of Applicant to have marijuana in\nhis apartment. Applicant claims to be a changed person, but his history reflects a person that when\ngiven a second or third chance by having his charges deferred or being placed on probation, he\nabused it and was back in trouble shortly thereafter. It does appear that Applicant is interested in\nturning life around, but at this point not enough time has lapsed to ensure he is truly committed and\nit is not fleeting. I find CC MC 32 (a) does not apply. There has been insufficient time to judge\nApplicant\u2019s commitment to obeying the law and following the rules. \nAlthough there is evidence that Applicant has been a good worker and has not been arrested\nin the last year, I found Applicant\u2019s testimony was especially troubling because it was inconsistent\nand he clearly provided contradictory answers, both during his testimony and with regard to his\nsworn answer. He changed his testimony during his hearing several times. He had weeks to complete\nhis SCA, yet failed to provide correct information. I find he failed to show successful rehabilitation,\nand therefore CC MC 32 (d) does not apply. \nBased on all the evidence, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) 25 (a) (any\ndrug abuse), DI DC 25 (b) (testing positive for illegal drug use), and 25 (c) (illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia), apply. Applicant began using drugs in 1995-1996 and continued to use them to\n2004. I find Applicant had drugs in his apartment in 2004 and based on his testimony that he used\nthem while living there. He used both cocaine and marijuana and purchased both for himself and\nothers in the past.\nI have considered all the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC), and especially\nconsidered DI MC 26 (a) ( the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), 26 (b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse\nany drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence;(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation).\nApplicant used illegal drugs from June 1995or 1996 to 2004. He tested positive for drug use\nwhile being drug screened as part of his probation. He used drugs after he was arrested and placed\non probation. It appears Applicant has not used drugs since 2004, and is committed to not using them\nin the future. He no longer associates with his friends who used drugs. It appears he has made\npositive changes in his life. However, the concern raised at his hearing was Applicant\u2019s lack of\ncredibility. He changed his story regarding when he ceased using drugs. Perhaps this was to appear\nmore committed to his abstinence. It does raise doubts as to his judgment and reliability. Therefore\nI cannot find DI MC 26 (a) applies. \n\n9\nIt has been approximately three years since his last drug use and Applicant has demonstrated\nhis intention not to use drugs in the future. He no longer associates with the same friends and he\nspends most of his time with his family. Therefore, I find DI MC 26 (b) applies.\nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. Applicant intentionally failed to list\nall of his criminal activity on his SCA. He admitted he had many criminal charges and the onus was\non him to ensure he included all of his conduct. Although he took some initiative, he was aware he\nhad other criminal charges in his past that he failed to divulge.\nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 17 (a) (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and PC MC 17 (e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation\nor duress). I find neither applies. Applicant\u2019s testimony at his hearing was not credible and not\nbelievable. He repeatedly contradicted his own testimony and his sworn statement and sworn SCA.\nHis testimony for why he failed to list all of his offenses was not believable. Although only one\nallegation regarding his failure to provide correct information was alleged, there was other\ninformation that he provided that was inaccurate and false. I did not consider these for disqualifying\npurposes, but I did weigh them to determine if Applicant made an innocent mistake or deliberately\nwithheld important information. I find he deliberately failed to provide accurate information. He did\nnot make a good faith effort to correct the information. He failed to offer any positive steps he has\ntake to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I find neither of the\nabove mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant has a very good work record and appears\nto be a devoted family man. Applicant also has a long history of criminal conduct, rules violations,\nand drug use. Applicant falsified his security clearance application and his testimony was not\ncredible. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns\nbased on his criminal conduct and personal conduct. I conclude he has mitigated the security\nconcerns raised by his drug involvement.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

A - G and I - R.\n On its face, her response to SOR \u00b6 2.a is an admission, but the accompanying explanation with respect to\n3\nintent, the gravamen of the allegation, is a denial.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 6, 2004, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P).\nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that\n1\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust. On August 23,\n2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security\nconcerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on November 16, 2006. I convened a hearing on January 10, 2007, at which the parties appeared\nas scheduled. The parties stipulated to the admission of all eleven exhibits proffered by the\ngovernment (Gx. 1- 11). Applicant testified and introduced 18 exhibits (Ax. A - R), of which 17\nwere admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 18, 2007.\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant is delinquent on nine unpaid accounts\ntotaling $12,402 as follows: an AT&T account in collection status for $298 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a Direct\nDigital satellite TV account in collection status for $133 (SOR  \u00b6 1.b); an unpaid bill to a pizza\nrestaurant in collection status for $121 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); an account in collection status for an unspecified\noriginal creditor for $298 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); an AT&T Broadband account in collection status for $213\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); a charged off credit union account for $8,371 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a charged off account to\nFinger Hut for $980 (SOR 1.g); a charged off RCA account for $1,786 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and a past due\ncollection account to an unspecified original creditor for $202 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). The government also\nalleged that Applicant deliberately falsified her response to question 20 of her SF 85P (debts\ncurrently more than 180 days past) by answering \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting the debts alleged in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\nApplicant admitted with explanations the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d - 1.g, and 1.i.  In\n3\naddition to her admissions, after a thorough review of the transcript and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of relevant fact:\nApplicant is 33 years old and has worked since November 2004 for a health care and medical\ninsurance company contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for TriCare, the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military personnel and their families.\nAfter working as a claims processor for a vision care provider from May 1999 until May 2004, she\nwas laid off with a three month severance package. She relied on state unemployment benefits for\n\n Gx. 1.\n4\n Ax. G; Ax. I.\n5\n Ax. I; Ax. J.\n6\n Ax. C; Ax D; Ax G; Gx. 3; Gx. 4; Gx. 5; Gx. 9.\n7\n4\nabout one month before obtaining her current job. Applicant was previously employed by a temp\nagency from December 1996 until May 1999.4\nApplicant is a single mother of two children, ages 8 and 14. She was married until December\n31, 2001. In June 2001, Applicant left her husband, taking their children with her, because of her ex-\nhusband\u2019s physical abuse of Applicant and his use of drugs. During the six months between their\nseparation and the official end of the marriage, Applicant obtained a protective order against her ex-\nhusband, but he violated that order and was jailed for it. Additionally, after they separated, her ex-\nhusband and his girlfriend lived in the marital home, tried to forge checks against Applicant\u2019s bank\naccount, ran up long distance phone bills (SOR \u00b6 1.a), added premium services to their digital cable\ntelevision account, took the cable box with him when he left the marital home as their divorce\nbecame final (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and generated other debts (SOR \u00b6 1.c), for which both Applicant and her\nex-husband were liable, but without Applicant\u2019s knowledge or consent.\nAs part of the divorce decree,  of the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant was assigned\n5\nresponsibility for the AT&T debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. However, she was only required to pay $72. The\nremainder of the listed balance stemmed from her ex-husband\u2019s long distance calls. Consistent with\nthe somewhat unique state laws on marital property in Applicant\u2019s state, the court retained\njurisdiction over the debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d (a collection account for an unpaid gas credit card),\n1.f (a car loan for their minivan), 1.g (a catalogue account the couple used to buy Christmas gifts\nduring their marriage), and 1.h (a past due medical bill from the birth of her younger child that\nshould have been covered by her ex-husband\u2019s insurance). Thus, if a creditor wished to be paid, the\ncourt would decide how much the Applicant and/or her ex-husband would pay. There is no\nindication any of the creditors has tried to collect since the divorce became final.\nThe divorce decree resolved the division of financial obligations by allowing Applicant to\npay her ex-husband $1,200 as an \u201cEqualizing Payment.\u201dShe liquidated her 401K savings to make\nthis payment.  Also, as part of the divorce decree, and to completely separate her interests from those\n6\nof her ex-husband, Applicant turned back to the finance company the aforementioned minivan, the\nloan for which her ex-husband\u2019s mother had co-signed. The resulting deficiency after re-sale was\n$9,098.65; however, even though Applicant made no further payments on this loan, the balance was\nreduced to $8,371 before it was charged off in October 2001.  Applicant thinks her ex-mother-in-law\n7\nmade payments on the debt after the repossession.\nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband was also ordered to pay Applicant $499 each month in child support,\nbut he has not done so. Nor has he paid for half of his children\u2019s day care, medical, dental or other\nexpenses as ordered. A personal financial statement (PFS) Applicant submitted when interviewed\nin April 2005 by a government investigator showed she earned $2,560 after deductions each month.\nExpenses, such as rent, insurance, food, utilities, and other miscellaneous costs totaled about $1,775\neach month. Applicant was also paying $262 in monthly car payments. A student loan with a balance\n\n Tr., 56, 59.\n8\n Tr. 55, 57 - 58.\n9\n Gx. 1.\n10\n Answer to SOR; Tr., 49 - 50.\n11\n Ax. R.\n12\n5\nof $5,128 is in deferral. The PFS reflected about $522 in net cash available each month after\nexpenses. At hearing, Applicant testified that she has paid off the aforementioned car loan. She also\nstated she lives with her boyfriend, who earns about $700 every two weeks.8\nApplicant has no knowledge of the broadband internet account referred to in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Also,\nthe collection account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i is for an unpaid medical or dental account attributable to\ncare her ex-husband received. The balance is now over $560. The digital television account (SOR\n\u00b6 1.b) remains unpaid because Applicant has been unable to determine if the cable box her ex-\nhusband took had been credited back to the account.\n \nAs to her efforts to pay or otherwise resolve the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant testified\nthat after the divorce she offered to make minimal payments to the catalogue company debt (SOR\n\u00b6 1.g), but the creditor wanted more than she could afford at the time. Her debts were thereafter\ncharged off and she did not address them further until the SOR was issued. She also looked into\nfiling for bankruptcy protection, but was told the accounts were so old that bankruptcy would be an\nineffective way to resolve her credit. Instead, she has focused on rebuilding her credit through buying\nand paying off her car and by avoiding additional delinquencies. She further testified that none of\nthe listed creditors in the SOR have tried to collect on the debts.9\nOn November 30, 2004, Applicant submitted an SF 85P. In response to question 20 (\u201cYour\nFinancial Record - 180-Day Delinquencies. Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or\nfinancial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal\nGovernment.)\u201d), Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d  She received advice and assistance in filling out her\n10\nquestionnaire from a company \u201ctrainer,\u201d a human resources employee who was helping several\nemployees complete their applications. The trainer interpreted question 20 for Applicant to mean she\nonly needed to declare delinquent federal loans. This understanding was based on the language of\nthe question when compared to question 19 (\u201cYour Financial Record - Bankruptcy, Liens,\nJudgements. In the last 7 years have you, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed\nfor bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgement rendered\nagainst you for a debt?\u201d), which she and the trainer understood was aimed at accounts such as those\nlisted in the SOR, but only if they were the subject of a lien or judgment.11\nApplicant is well-regarded at work. Associates who have know her since 2004 speak highly\nof her work ethic, honesty, reliability, and her character as a single mother.12\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\n\n Directive, Enclosure 2.\n13\n A memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and\n14\nSecurity to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of\ntrustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved using the provisions of the Directive rather than, as\noriginally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, as amended (Regulation). Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP102.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases.\n Also, Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions\n15\nand mitigating conditions associated with each guideline. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication\nprocedures contained in the Directive. (Regulation, C8.2.1)\n Directive, 6.3.\n16\n \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n17\nconcept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should\nconsider the following factors:\n \nE2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n \nE2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;\n \nE2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n \nE2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n \nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence;\u201d\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). See also, Regulation, C6.1.1.1 (\u201cThe standard\n18\nthat must be met for...assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty,\nreliability, and trustworthiness are such that...assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security.\u201d)  \n6\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n13\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information.  Each trustworthiness determination must\n14\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under\neach adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.  Each determination\n15\nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and it must reflect the adjudication process outlined in the Directive at\n16\nSection E2.2.1.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\n17\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance\ngoverning the grant or denial of access to sensitive information.\nTrustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest  for an applicant to receive or continue to have access to sensitive\n18\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the burden then\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n19\n See Egan; Directive, E2.2.2.\n20\n Directive, E2.A5.1.1.\n21\n Directive, E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\n22\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities;\n7\nshifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. As with security\nclearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an applicant bears a heavy burden of\n19\npersuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each\napplicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect\nsensitive information pertaining to the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent\nwith the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for access in favor of the government.20\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, a security concern may arise if it is shown an\napplicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.  Here, the government questioned\n21\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness by alleging she deliberately \u201cfalsified material facts on a Security\nClearance Application, Standard Form 85P, executed by [her] under date December 6, 2004\" by\nanswering \u201cno\u201d to question 20, as discussed above (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nApplicant is seeking an ADP I/II/III position of trust, not a security clearance. Further, the\nSF 85P produced by the government in support of this allegation was signed and submitted by\nApplicant on November 30, 2004. Nonetheless, Applicant did not contest the allegation based on\nthese errors. While she  admitted the fact of her omission, she denied the gravamen of the allegation;\nthat is, that she intended by her omission to deceive or mislead the government about her financial\nproblems. I conclude that the date listed in SOR \u00b6 2.a is a typographical error, and that Department\nCounsel submitted sufficient information to show that these omissions and inaccuracies exist. \nBased on available information, Guideline E DC 2  must be considered. However, Applicant\n22\ndemonstrated she lacked the intent to falsify or mislead, as required by the plain language of DC 2\nwhen she completed her SF 85P. Her explanation of her understanding of the question, when taken\ntogether with the advice she received and the wording of the question about student or federal loans,\nwas both plausible and credible. In light of all of the information probative of this issue, DC 2 does\nnot apply, and I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, an applicant who is financially overextended\nthrough delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of engaging in\n\n Directive, E2.A6.1.1.\n23\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;\n24\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n25\n Directive, E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control\n26\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation); \n Directive, E2.A6.1.3.1. The behavior was not recent;\n27\n8\nillegal acts to generate funds to resolve their fiscal difficulties.  Applicant incurred several debts\n23\nduring her marriage that have gone unpaid since 2001, when her divorce decree was issued. She was\nunable to pay those debts for several years, but her most recent PFS shows she has a positive cash\nflow that would enable to her to address at least some of the listed debts. These facts warrant\nconsideration of Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1  and DC 3.  \n24\n25\nBy contrast, through Applicant\u2019s divorce decree it appears she may no longer be liable for\nsome of the listed debts. Specifically, she paid her ex-husband $1,200 from her 401K retirement\nsavings plan to settle her share of some of the marital debts, and the debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d,\n1.g, and 1.h, which total $3,362, were retained by the court in case creditors came looking for their\npayments. It appears none of them did. Jurisdiction over the $8,371 deficiency after re-sale of the\nminivan which Applicant returned (SOR \u00b6 1.f), was also retained by the court through the divorce\ndecree. As a co-signer on the car note, Applicant\u2019s ex-mother-in-law was also liable for this debt.\nAdditionally, Applicant has no knowledge of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e (totaling $334), and\nthe $202 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i resulted from her ex-husband\u2019s medical care after they separated. This\nleaves only the $131 digital television account (SOR \u00b6 1.b) unaccounted for. Applicant avers this,\ntoo, was a result of her ex-husband\u2019s actions after they separated but before he left the marital abode.\nRather than unnecessarily assume full responsibility for the debts she and her husband\ngenerated during their marriage, she has, since 2001, focused on rebuilding her credit and avoiding\nfurther delinquencies. To that end, she has paid off a car loan, has no credit cards, has a job that pays\nher well, and she has a positive cash flow. She has done this despite her ex-husband\u2019s failure to pay\nsupport and other expenses as ordered in the divorce. Because of the circumstances surrounding her\ndivorce, I have considered Guideline F mitigating condition (MC) 3.  In the five years since her\n26\ndivorce Applicant has not taken any recent action to resolve the listed debts of which she was aware,\nprimarily because she understood many of the debts were resolved through her divorce decree.\nIn light of all of the information probative of this issue, it is unclear for what debts Applicant\nis responsible. At worst, she and her ex-husband may be subject to a division of these obligations\nby the court that issued their divorce decree. However, there is no indication their creditors have\nbeen trying to collect on the listed debts. Applicant is not now financially overextended, and the\nlisted debts are not recent, requiring consideration of MC 1.  The mere presence of unpaid debts\n27\ndoes not automatically disqualify one from holding a sensitive position, and the debts in this case\nare not a source of pressure on Applicant to obtain funds through illegal or other inappropriate\nmeasures. I conclude Guideline F for the Applicant.\n\n See note 17, supra.\n28\n9\nWhole Person. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have also considered the adjudicative\nprocess factors collectively referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Applicant is a mature adult,\n28\nwho carries a heavy responsibility in caring for her two children. The circumstances that resulted in\nthe debts in the first place stemmed from the end of her marriage, and she has taken steps to improve\nher financial standing so as to avoid similar problems in the future. As a matter of common sense,\nthe facts presented in this case do not pose an unacceptable risk to the interests of national security.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for assignment to a sensitive\nposition. Eligibility is granted.\nMatthew E. Malone\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 10, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement\n1\nof Reasons  (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under\n2\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nAugust 28, 2006 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was\nassigned to me on October 5, 2006.  On November 2, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination\nfor Applicant.

(Tr. 25-32, 39-42; Exhibit 1,\n2)\nApplicant has been unemployed twice in the past six years, from December 2002 to June\n2003, and again in April 2004 until July 2004 when she started to work for her current  employer.\nAt her present job she is rated highly by her supervisors and is considered the second in charge in\nher consult return work area.  She is dependable and conscientious.  She has a high daily workload\noutput.  She earns $13.59 per hour, for an annual income of $21,744. (Tr. 13, 42; Exhibits 1, 2, A-F,\nAnswer)\nApplicant has no savings or retirement accounts.  She has one credit card with a $200\nbalance.  She is trying not to incur other debts.  Her net income monthly is about $1,520.  After\n\n4\nexpenses, her financial statement in February 2005 showed she had $371.66 net remainder.  Her\ncurrent net remainder is not calculated by Applicant. (Tr. 29-31, 38, 39; Exhibit 2) \nOf the 22 delinquent debts listed in the SOR, 18 are under $300. (Exhibits 4, 5)Fifteen  of\nthose debts are medical bills (SOR \u00b6 1.b., 1.d. - 1.n., 1.r., 1.u., and 1.v.) she incurred a few years ago\nfor treatment of a seizure disorder she had.  These bills are for co-pays or services not covered by\nher health insurance at the time.  Seven of the bills are for credit card issuers for items Applicant\npurchased since 1996 when she bought her house (SOR \u00b6 1.a., 1.c., 1.o. - 1.q., 1.s., and 1.t.)  She\nattempted to settle some of the bills and succeeded in that effort.  The creditors for other bills did not\nrespond to her offer of installment payments of small amounts but accepted the checks she sent.\nSpecifically, the present disposition of Applicant\u2019s debts are as follows:\nCredit card, \u00b6 1.a., $2,480, is not paid. (Tr. 14)\nMedical bills, \u00b6 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., for $211.50, $104, and $105.33, respectively are on one bill\nfrom a  collection agency for which she pays one amount monthly. (Tr. 16, 18)\nA credit card bill for $191.46 (\u00b6 1.c.) was settled for $58.80 and Applicant paid it. (Tr. 17;\nExhibits 2, 3)\nTwo hospital bills, \u00b6 1.f. for $275.73 and \u00b61.v. for $161, are being paid at $10 monthly, and\nApplicant has paid that amount for the past two months. (Tr. 18)\nThe medical bills listed in \u00b6 1.g. to \u00b61.n., and \u00b61.u., with the respective debts being $14.85,\n$29.70, $93.50, $153.85, $25.16, $14.85, $19.95, $185.12, and $115, are being paid at the rate of\n$5 each monthly.  Applicant went to the collection agency\u2019s website and arranged that payment\nmethod. (Tr. 18, 19, 35)\nThe credit card debt at \u00b6 1.o. for $1,742 Applicant has been paying regularly for several years\nat $50 per month.  The present amount owed is a result of those payments, with the original debt\nbeing about $2,600. (Tr. 20, 21; Exhibit 3) \nThe credit card debt in \u00b6 1.p. for $1,695.25 Applicant attempted to arrange a repayment plan,\nand sent $10 in good faith to the creditor.  The creditor cashed her check but never responded to her.\n(Tr. 21, 22; Exhibits 2, 3)\nThe credit card debt in \u00b6 1.q. for $3,091.11 is being repaid at $26.41 every two weeks. (Tr.\n22; Exhibits 3, G)\nThe credit card debt in \u00b6 1.s. for $145 is the same debt listed in \u00b6 1.t. based on a comparison\nof amounts, account numbers, and Applicant\u2019s exhibit showing the debt was paid.  Applicant paid\nthe debt September 28, 2006, on a settlement of $53.09. (Tr. 23, 24; Exhibits 4, 5, H, I)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\n\n5\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. See ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as\nto whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\n\n6\nGuideline F:Financial Considerations: The Concern: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. E2.A6.1.1\nPositions designated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. (Regulation\n\u00b6AP10.2.1)  ADP III positions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation AP102.3.1)  By memorandum\ndated November 19, 2004, the Deputy under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and\nSecurity directed DOHA to resolve all contractor cases submitted for trustworthiness determinations,\nincluding ADP I, II, and III, under the Directive.  Thus, even though they are nonsensitive positions,\nADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures\nas ADP I and II cases.\n \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations: Applicant had 22 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Two\nlistings were duplicates, so she actually had 21 delinquent debts.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1\n(A history of not meeting financial obligations. E2.A6.1.2.1), and DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts. E2.A6.1.2.3) apply.  These debts were credit card debts and medical bills not\ncovered by her medical insurance.\nMitigating Conditions (MC) 3 (Conditions resulting in the behavior were beyond Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol because of unemployment and medical problems. E2.A6.1.3.3), and MC 6 (Applicant\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. E2.A6.1.3.6)\napply.  Applicant\u2019s income never exceeded $22,000 in the past ten years.  She also is the single\nparent of a six year old child.  She had two periods of unemployment since 2000 that affected her\nability to repay her debts.  She paid two debts through settlements (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.s. and 1.t.).  She is\npaying two credit card bills at the rate of $50 each per month.  She also has paid $5 per month on\nnine medical bills, five will be repaid soon because they are less than $25 each.  The remaining bills\nwill be repaid thereafter.  Her credit card bills, but for the first one listed in the SOR, she is repaying\nto the best of her financial ability.  When the other bills are paid, she will turn her attention to the\nlast bill.  Applicant has only one active credit card, and is working to repay her delinquent debts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision.  I considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s loss of employment twice, her chronic low income, her attempts to contact her creditors,\nher efforts at repaying all of them, and her regular payments on some of the credit card debts.\nApplicant has stopped making purchases she cannot afford on her current income, so she is not\nrepeating her past behavior.  Purchasing her house in 1996 resulted from her recognition that she\nshould not be wasting the money she was obtaining from her auto accident, but should invest it in\nreal estate.  She has made specific efforts to contact her creditors and repay them in a good-faith\neffort.  The one unpaid credit card debt is beyond her financial means now, but based on her past\nperformance, she will use the money freed from the earlier repayments to devote to repaying that\ndebt in the future.  Considering all these factors, I conclude the financial considerations\ntrustworthiness concern for Applicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. to 1.v.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Eligibility for an\nADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant her a position of\n1\ntrust. On August 7, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts in Applicant\u2019s\nbackground that raise trustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E\n(personal conduct), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline G (alcohol).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on November 16, 2006, and I convened a hearing on January 10, 2007. The government\nsubmitted four exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4) that were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\ntestified, produced two witnesses, and introduced three exhibits (Ax. A - C), which were admitted\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1 that Applicant deliberately falsified her answer to\nquestion 16 (arrests, charges, and/or convictions for any offense in the past seven years) of an SF 85P\nshe submitted in April 2003 by listing two arrests in 2001, but omitting a November 1998 arrest for\nbeing under the influence of a controlled substance (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that she deliberately falsified\nher answer to question 16 (arrests, charges, and/or convictions for any offense in the past seven\nyears) of an October 2004 SF 85P by answering \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting the same November 1998\narrest (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She admitted she did not list the arrests, but denied the gravamen of the\nallegations; that is, doing so with intent to mislead.\nUnder SOR \u00b6 2, the government alleged Applicant was arrested in November 1998, and\ncharged with being under the influence of a controlled substance, which was later dismissed (SOR\n\u00b6 2.a); that she was arrested in May 2001, was charged with and pleaded no contest to drunk driving,\nand with hit and run with property damage, was fined, placed on probation until December 2002, and\nordered to attend an alcohol awareness and safety class (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that she was arrested in July\n2001, charged with and pleaded no contest to driving on a suspended license, was fined and given\na 10-day jail sentence (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and that he violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately falsifying\nher SF 85Ps as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1 (SOR \u00b6 2.d). In response, Applicant admitted with explanation\nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c, but denied intentionally falsifying her SF 85P responses\nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d.\nUnder SOR \u00b6 3, the government alleged Applicant consumed alcohol between 2001 and\n2004, at times to excess and to intoxication (SOR \u00b6 3.a); that her arrest listed in \u00b6 2.b is also an\nalcohol-related security concern (SOR \u00b6 3.b); and that, in February 2004, she felt her alcohol use was\na problem and that she was considering treatment or counseling (SOR \u00b6 3.c). Applicant admitted all\nthree allegations.\n\n Tr., 67 - 73.\n2\n Gx. 4; Tr., 28.\n3\n Tr., 43.\n4\n Gx. 1; Gx. 3; Gx. 4; Tr., 41 - 42.\n5\n3\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the\ntranscript and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of relevant fact:\nApplicant is 27 years old and has worked since January 2003 for a health care and medical\ninsurance company contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for TriCare, the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military personnel and their families.\nHer work record has been very good. Her evaluations and feedback from her supervisor, who\ntestified at the hearing, show she has been very reliable and has had no problems on the job. Her\nsupervisor also noted Applicant has shown more maturity and personal growth at work in the last\nyear.  Applicant has been married since June 2003, and they have one child, who was born in March\n2\n2005.\n From about 1996 until 2000, Applicant used methamphetamine (\u201cmeth\u201d), an illegal\nsubstance. She used primarily because her boyfriend used meth and other drugs on a regular basis.\nOn November 22, 1998, Applicant went to her boyfriend\u2019s apartment because he was mentally\nunstable from excessive drug use that day. She had been using meth either earlier in the day or the\nnight before. Her boyfriend was paranoid and thought he would be attacked, so he called the police.\nThey arrested him and Applicant after both tested positive for drugs in their systems. As part of a\nplea deal by her boyfriend, Applicant pleaded guilty to being under the influence of illegal drugs, but\nwas released without jail time, fines, or other penalties. Applicant was under the impression the\ncharges had been expunged or that her record in this matter was sealed.3\nApplicant has consumed alcohol, often to the point of intoxication, since she was 16 years\nold.  On May 12, 2001, she drove some friends to a public park to go drinking. They were threatened\n4\nby some teenagers nearby, so Applicant tried to drive away, but struck a car on the way out of the\npark. After leaving the park, she and her friends called the police to report the incident and the fact\nthey had hit a car. When they met with police, Applicant was given a breathalyser test that showed\nher blood alcohol content to be greater than the .08% state limit. She was arrested and charged with\ndrunk driving, hit & run, and alcohol related over .08%. She pleaded no contest to a reduced charge\nof wet reckless driving (a driving offense involving alcohol, but less than the legal limit). Her\ndriver\u2019s license was suspended, and she was placed on probation for 18 months.5\nOn July 18, 2001, Applicant was pulled over for having her high beams on. She was charged\nwith driving on a suspended license, and she pleaded no contest. Her probation was extended to three\nyears and she served ten days in jail on weekends.\nApplicant submitted an SF 85P in April 2003. In response to question 16 (\u201cYour Police\nRecord. In the last seven years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any\noffense(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150).\u201d), Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d and listed her two\narrests in 2001, but not her arrest in 1998. She has explained that she thought she did not have to list\n\n Answer to SOR; Ax. C; Tr., 38 - 40.\n6\n Gx. 3.\n7\n Gx. 4.\n8\n Gx. 2.\n9\n Tr., 56.\n10\n Tr., 43.\n11\n Tr., 78.\n12\n Tr., 44.\n13\n Tr., 58.\n14\n Tr., 47 - 48.\n15\n4\nthe 1998 arrest because the charge was dismissed or the record of it had been sealed.  However,\n6\nwhen she was interviewed by a government investigator in February 2004, she stated that she had\npleaded guilty.  When interviewed again in May 2005, she stated she thought she did not have to list\n7\nthe arrest because she thought it was outside the seven-year time requirement.8\nWhen her company\u2019s contract requirements changed, she was asked to fill out another SF\n85P in October 2004. In response to the same question, she answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting all three\nof her arrests.  She could not explain why the arrests were not included in the second questionnaire.\n9\nApplicant told investigators in February 2004 that she felt she had a problem with alcohol.\nShe has experienced several bouts of binge drinking and stated that it takes about a fifth of liquor\nfor her to feel intoxicated. Applicant knows she has developed a high tolerance for alcohol, and has\ntried to limit her consumption to wine with dinner only. She has attended Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) meetings on her own about ten times. Most recently, she attended three meetings in the two\nmonths before her hearing. She is not working the 12 steps, and she does not yet have a sponsor.\nApplicant regards herself as an alcoholic, and admits she has trouble abstaining from alcohol. Her\ndifficulty in this regard is due, in part, to the fact her husband drinks, and sometimes he \u201ccan\u2019t stand\nthat [Applicant] is not going to drink with him.\u201d10\nApplicant testified she last consumed alcohol about two months before the hearing.  Her\n11\nhusband subsequently testified they had drank champagne together either previous week or ten days\nearlier on New Years Eve.  On cross-examination, Applicant stated she was last intoxicated prior\n12\nto June 2004, when she became pregnant with her child.  In response to questions from the bench,\n13\nshe acknowledged she had gotten drunk at a party in the spring of 2005, after her child was born.14\nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister have expressed to her their concern about her drinking. Applicant\nknows she has to stop drinking and wants to quit so she and her husband can have another child.15\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\n\n Directive, Enclosure 2.\n16\n Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to show that a memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy\n17\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved\nusing the provisions of the Directive rather than, as originally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel\nSecurity Program, as amended (Regulation). Applicant did not object and I granted the motion. (Tr., 11) Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP10.2.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases. The adjudicative guidelines in the Directive cases are virtually identical\nto those in the Regulation.\n Also, Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions\n18\nand mitigating conditions associated with each guideline. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication\nprocedures contained in the Directive. (Regulation, C8.2.1)\n Directive, 6.3.\n19\n \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n20\nconcept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should\nconsider the following factors:\n \nE2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n \nE2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;\n \nE2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n \nE2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n \nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence;\u201d\n5\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n16\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information.  Each trustworthiness determination must\n17\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under\neach adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.  Each determination\n18\nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and it must reflect the adjudication process outlined in the Directive at\n19\nSection E2.2.1.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\n20\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance\ngoverning the grant or denial of access to sensitive information. Having reviewed the information\npresented by the parties, I conclude Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline G (alcohol), and\nGuideline J (criminal conduct) must be considered in this case.\nUnder the Regulation, trustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether\nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for an applicant to receive or continue\n\n Regulation, C6.1.1.1 (\u201cThe standard that must be met for...assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\n21\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that...assigning the person to sensitive\nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d)\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531.\n22\n See Egan; Directive, E2.2.2.\n23\n Directive, E2.A5.1.1.\n24\n SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 16, but goes on to allege she deliberately omitted only\n25\nher 1998 arrest. Gx. 2 plainly shows she did not list as required any of her arrests in the last seven years. However, the\ngovernment did not explain why SOR \u00b6 1.b does not allege omission of the 2001 arrests.\n6\nto have access to sensitive information.  The government bears the initial burden of producing\n21\nadmissible information on which it based the preliminary decision against the applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate\nthe government\u2019s case. As with security clearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an\n22\napplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect sensitive information pertaining to the national interests as\nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d standard compels\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.23\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, a security concern may arise if it is shown an\napplicant has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.  The government questioned Applicant\u2019s\n24\ntrustworthiness by alleging she deliberately falsified material facts on her SF 85P in April 2003 by\nomitting her 1998 arrest from her response to question 16 of her 2003 SF 85P (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and by\nomitting all her arrests from her response to the same question on her 2004 SF 85P (SOR 1.b).25\nApplicant responded to SOR \u00b6 1.a, by stating she thought her 1998 arrest did not have to be\ndisclosed because the charge had been dismissed. However, in two statements to government\ninvestigators, she provided two other explanations. She disclosed both her 2001 arrests in her April\n2003 SF 85P. As to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant had no explanation why none of her arrests were listed on\nher October 2004 SF 85P, which was submitted pursuant to a change in her company\u2019s contract with\nthe government. \nI conclude Applicant intended to falsify her answers in both questionnaires. Each of her three\nexplanations, standing alone, might be plausible reasons why she did not list her 1998 arrest on\neither form. As to the second SF 85P, omitting all her arrests after declaring the two most recent\narrests on the first SF 85P seemingly would not make sense. However, combined with her conflicting\ntestimony at hearing, her disparate explanations of her answers to question 16 tend to support the\n\n Directive, E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\n26\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities; and E2.A5.1.2.5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of\nany written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.\n Directive, E2.A7.1.1. \n27\n Directive, E2.A7.1.2.1. Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\n28\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use; and E2.A7.1.2.5. Habitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.\n7\ngovernment\u2019s allegations. Additionally, I am concerned about her lack of candor in testimony about\nher drinking, discussed under Guideline G, below. In short, available information requires\napplication of Guideline E DC 2 and DC 5.   By contrast, there is insufficient information in this\n26\nrecord to warrant application of any of the listed mitigating conditions. Based on all available\ninformation probative of this issue, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.\nAlcohol Consumption. The security concern about alcohol consumption, as expressed\nthrough Guideline G, is that excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  This issue may be presented\n27\nas alcohol-related incidents such as fighting, domestic violence, arrests for alcohol-related crimes,\nand clinical diagnoses of alcoholism or alcohol dependence. Here, available information shows\nApplicant began abusing alcohol in high school until at least early 2005, when she is last known to\nhave been intoxicated (SOR \u00b6 3.a). It was not unusual for Applicant to consume as much as 1/4 a\nbottle of vodka in a single sitting, and, from about 1996 until 2000, she would abuse alcohol while\nalso using methamphetamine with her boyfriend. Her drinking has resulted in at least one arrest\n(SOR \u00b6 3.b), and has caused her mother and sister to voice their concerns about how much she\ndrinks. Alcohol has been enough of a problem for Applicant that she believes she is an alcoholic,\nand that she should seek counseling and/or treatment for her use of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 3.c). These facts\nrequire consideration of Guideline G DC 1 and DC 5.  \n28\nApplicant responded to the government\u2019s information by asserting she is working to\novercome her problems with alcohol by attending AA meetings and working to abstain from alcohol\naltogether. On the latter point, she has had mixed results. She acknowledges having a glass or two\nof wine periodically, but her claims are suspect due to her inconsistent testimony about when she last\nconsumed alcohol and when she was last intoxicated. As to her participation at AA, while laudable\nand to be encouraged, this is too recent and infrequent to be a reliable indicator of sobriety. Applicant\nhas no sponsor and is not yet working on a structured approach such as the 12-step program\nadvocated by AA. Despite her apparent acknowledgment of her problems with alcohol, Applicant\nhas failed to show the actions she is taking will be effective or that they will continue; nor has she\nestablished a sufficient period of sobriety on which the government may rely in determining that her\nuse of alcohol will no longer cast doubt on her trustworthiness. The information Applicant submitted\nis insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s reasonable doubts about her trustworthiness raised by\nher use of alcohol. In light of all the available information probative of this issue, I conclude\nGuideline G against the Applicant.\n\n Directive, E2.A10.1.1.\n29\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n30\n  Directive, E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\n31\nformally charged; and E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\n Directive, E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was not recent.\n32\n Directive, E2.A10.1.3.6. There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.\n33\n See note 20, supra.\n34\n8\nCriminal Conduct. Applicant\u2019s arrests and false statements to the government raise\ntrustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline J. Specifically, a history or\npattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.29\nA person who is willing to disregard the law and risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to\ndisregard rules and regulations governing the protection of sensitive information. The criminal\nactivity at issue may consist of a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. \nHere, the government has reasonable doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nsensitive information because available information shows she was arrested three times between\n1998 and 2001. As to her first arrest in 1998 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), although the charge was dismissed as part\nof her boyfriend\u2019s plea bargain, available information is sufficient to show, as alleged in the SOR,\nApplicant violated state laws against illegal drug use. The record further supports the allegations that\nApplicant was convicted in May 2001 for DUI (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and in July 2001 for driving on a\nsuspended license (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant also engaged in criminal conduct by intentionally\nfalsifying her two SF 85P questionnaires (SOR \u00b6 2.d), as discussed under Guideline E, above. It is\nagainst federal criminal law to knowingly and wilfully make a false statement or representation to\nany agency of the U.S. government concerning a matter within its jurisdiction.  The facts established\n30\nthrough SOR \u00b6 2 require consideration of Guideline J DC 1 and DC 2.31\nNone of the Guideline J mitigating conditions apply here. But for Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nfalsification of her 2003 and 2004 SF 85Ps, the record would support consideration of Guideline J\nMC 1  as her other criminal conduct occurred nearly six years ago. Further, given that at least one\n32\nof Applicant\u2019s arrests was alcohol-related, were it not for on going concerns about Applicant\u2019s use\nof alcohol, discussed under Guideline G, above, the record would also support consideration of\nGuideline J MC 6.  Since her last arrest, she has made several recent positive changes in her\n33\nlifestyle. However, her unreliable statements about her last alcohol use, and her recent falsification\nof her questionnaires undermine any claim of rehabilitation. As long as she drinks, she will be at risk\nof future criminal conduct. Because there is insufficient information available to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns about her criminal conduct, I conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.\nWhole Person. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have also considered the adjudicative\nprocess factors collectively referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Applicant\u2019s record at work\n34\nis very good, and she has the support of management based on her performance over the past few\nyears. She is a mature adult who is trying to rectify several past problems in her life, most notably\nher alcohol use and the legal and personal problems it has caused. She and her husband have started\na family and are endeavoring to become financially sound. Yet the disqualifying information about\n\n Directive, E2.2.3. \n35\n9\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use and criminal conduct is exacerbated by failure to be completely candid at\nhearing. This conclusively undermines her claims of rehabilitation. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of the entire record before me shows the government properly expressed reasonable\n35\ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a sensitive position. The SOR was based on sufficient,\nreliable information about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and alcohol consumption. Such issues bear\ndirectly on an applicant\u2019s ability and willingness to exercise the requisite good judgment and\ndiscretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its sensitive information. Absent\nsubstantial information to mitigate these doubts, which Applicant has failed to provide, I cannot\nconclude she has mitigated the security concerns expressed in the SOR.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline G (Alcohol):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for\nassignment to a sensitive position.

She presented no evidence that any debts\n\n2\nwere resolved and no evidence of a plan for resolving them.  Trustworthiness concerns based on\nfinancial considerations are not mitigated.  Eligibility is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 12, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for\nassignment to an ADP I/II/III position.  This action was taken Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive), and Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R,\nPersonnel Security Program (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation).  \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Regulation.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 29, 2006, and\nelected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 25, 2007. A complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received the FORM on February 6, 2007, but did  not respond.  The case was assigned to\nme on March 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 31-year-old claims associate for a defense contractor.  She has worked for her\ncurrent employer since September 1996.  She is unmarried and has two children, ages four and 13.\nShe has never held a security clearance or been found eligible for sensitive positions.\nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling more than $26,000.  Applicant has admitted\nall the debts.  (FORM Item 2).  The two largest debts were attributable to car repossessions.  The\ndebt of $2,992 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a occurred when her car was wrecked, but the insurance was\ninsufficient to pay off the balance due on the loan, and it was repossessed in 2002.  The debt of\n$20,741 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f occurred when she purchased a car in March 2004 but could not afford\nthe payments.  It was repossessed in September 2004.  The remaining delinquent debts are for\njewelry ($1,190) (SOR \u00b6 1.b), two medical bills for $104 and $80 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d), a telephone\nbill of $707 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and a delinquent credit card account with a balance of $669 (SOR \u00b6 1.f).\n(FORM Item 5 at 1-2; FORM Items 6, 7, and 8.)\nIn June 2005, Applicant provided a security investigator with a personal financial statement\nshowing monthly net income of $1,939, monthly expenses of $806, monthly debt payments of\n$1,243, and a net monthly shortfall of $109.  Her two largest expenses were a mortgage payment of\n$423 and a car payment of $450.  (FORM Item 5 at 4.)  Her monthly shortfall is alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.h.  Applicant has submitted no evidence of payment, attempted payment, or a plan for resolving\nthe debts.\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out in Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2R, Personnel\nSecurity Program (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), are used to make ADP\ntrustworthiness determinations.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right\nto the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final unfavorable trustworthiness\ndetermination may be made.  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  Regulation\n\u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive\nduties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness\nare such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.\u201d  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline.  \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  Regulation\nAppendix 8.  Each eligibility determination must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in the Regulation. \nIn security clearance cases, the Government must initially present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for\naccess to classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for\npresenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n19, 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  These same\nburdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201c[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.  A person who fails or\nrefuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless\nin his or her duty to protect sensitive information.  Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this\nguideline could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies\nwhere an applicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Id.  DC 3 applies\nwhere an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Id.  \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise DC 1 and DC 3, the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive\n\n5\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving\nit is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA trustworthiness concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the\ndelinquent debts were not recent (MC 1) or were isolated incidents (MC 2).  Regulation Appendix\n8 at 144.  Applicant has multiple delinquent debts that remain unresolved.  I conclude MC 1 and MC\n2 are not established.\nTrustworthiness concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they\nare the result of conditions \u201clargely beyond the person\u2019s control\u201d (MC 3).  Id.  Even if Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond her control, it is appropriate to\nconsider whether she acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties.\nISCR Case No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).  The total loss of her car in 2002 was a\ncircumstance beyond her control, but Applicant presented no evidence of reasonable efforts to\nresolve or compromise the debt that resulted from the insurance shortfall.  I conclude MC 3 is not\nestablished.\nA mitigating condition (MC 4) applies when an applicant \u201chas received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control.\u201d  Regulation Appendix 8 at 144.  MC 4 is not established because Applicant has not\nsought financial counseling.\nA trustworthiness concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a\ngood-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Id.  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Applicant\npresented no evidence of any effort to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR.  I conclude MC 6 is not\nestablished.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, I have\nconsidered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Regulation Appendix 8 at 132.  \nApplicant is a mature woman who has been employed since graduating from high school, and\nhas worked for her current employer for more than 10 years.

He became a U.S. citizen in 1986 and has lived here ever since.  He retains his Tunisian\ncitizenship and recently renewed his Tunisian passport, to facilitate his travel to that country to visit\nhis family.  He intends to retain both his Tunisian  passport and citizenship. He has numerous close\nfamily ties to that country and several relatives have had problems with the Tunisian government\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s status as a joint citizen of the U.S.  Applicant himself is sometimes\nquestioned by airport authorities when he visits that country.  As to both Guidelines, he has not\nmitigated the risks established by the Government\u2019s evidence.  Clearance is denied. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 4, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn November 3, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on November 22, 2006.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 8, 2007, setting\nthe hearing for February 15, 2007.  The Government introduced three (3) exhibits (Government\u2019s\nExhibits (GX) 1 - 3 and four (4) Official Notice documents (ON 1-4).  On February 20, 2007, the\nGovernment  offered three additional documents that were previously inadvertently omitted from\nthe case file.  Applicant testified, and introduced four documents (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A - D).\nThe transcript was received on February 27, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 58-year-old programmer, born in Tunisia in 1968.  He became a U.S. citizen\nin 1986 (GX 1, at Item 4).  He recognizes himself as a dual citizen with Tunisia ( Id., at Item 1). He\nhas been employed by defense contractors since at least 1986 (Id., at Item 6).  He was willing to\nrenounce his Tunisian citizenship (GX 3), but has since changed his mind.  \nThe September 25, 2006 SOR contains two (2) allegations under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and 14 allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant denied allegations\n1.a and 1.b.  He admitted allegations 2.a., 2.b., 2.c., 2.d., 2.e., 2.f., 2.g., 2.h., 2.i., 2.j., 2.m., and 2.n.\nHe denied allegation 2.k.  The specific admissions are hereby accepted and incorporated into this\ndecision as Findings of Fact. `\nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following  additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\n\n3\n1.a. - Applicant was born in Tunisia.  He came to the U.S. in about 1980 to attend college\nfrom 1980-1983.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1986 and possesses a U.S. passport.  He\nis married to a woman born in Tunisia who now has dual U.S.-Tunisian citizenship.  He has three\nchildren, all of who are native-born U.S. citizens, but who also have dual Tunisian citizenship (GX\n1).  Applicant retains dual citizenship with Tunisia and he renewed his Tunisian passport on\nSeptember 4, 2006.  That passport is valid until September 3, 2011 (Tr at 25 and GX 2).\n1.b. Since 1986, Applicant has used his U.S. passport for all purposes except for entering and\nleaving Tunisia.  He does  so because that country requires the use of a Tunisian passport by anyone\nborn in Tunisia, regardless of any other citizenship (Tr at 24).  The only exception was in June 2006,\nwhen the Tunisian embassy in Washington, D.C. authorized him to enter and leave that country\nusing his U.S. passport.  \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n2.a. - Applicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of the U.S. (naturalized in 1999) and Tunisia.  She\nresides with Applicant in the U.S.  She was born in 1963 and married Applicant in Tunisia in 1986,\nthe same year Applicant became a U.S. citizen and began working here.  \n2.b - Applicant\u2019s three children are dual citizens of  the U.S. and Tunisia. They reside with\nhim in the U.S.\n2.c. - Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Tunisia and resides in that country. \n2.d. - Applicant provides about $200.00 per month to his mother in Tunisia.\n2.e. -Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen of Tunisia and resides in that country. \n2.f. - Applicant\u2019 brother is a retired officer in the Tunisian military. \n2.g. - Applicant\u2019s three sisters are citizens of Tunisia and reside in that country. \n2.h. - Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen of Tunisia and resides in that country.  He is a\npolice officer. \n2.i. - Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of Tunisia and resides in that country. \n  \n2.j. - Applicant\u2019s wife has two brothers and two sisters who are  citizens of Tunisia and reside\nin that country. \n2.k. - Applicant\u2019s nephew is a citizen of Tunisia, but presently resides and attends college\nin the U.S.  Applicant provides financial support to his nephew.\n2.l. - Applicant\u2019s relative, cited in 1.e. and 1.f., above, was harassed while in the Tunisian\nmilitary, for  reasons Applicant believes were connected with  Applicant\u2019s acquiring U.S. citizenship\n(GX 2 and Tr at 41, 42).\n\n4\n2.m. - Applicant has reasons to believe that the safety of his mother and brother will be\njeopardized by the Tunisian government if his statements about his brother\u2019s treatment in the\nTunisian military become known (Id).  His brother had a \u201cgood career, [but] all of a sudden things\nhave started to change for him\u201d (Tr at 42). \n2.n. - Applicant traveled to Tunisia in August 2003, June and December 2004, June 2005,\nand June 2006.  There has been some harassment at the airport in Tunisia (Tr at 49). \nApplicant has worked for the same major Defense contractor for about 20 years. His\nsupervisor thinks very highly of Applicant and explains that Applicant needs a security  clearance\nto continue working as he is currently needed.  The supervisor has known Applicant for three years\nand believes him to be a \u201cvery good citizen of this nation and [who] adheres to the principles and\nvalues under which this nation was founded.  I am confident that [Applicant] will always work\ntoward protecting the interests and integrity of [the U.S.] \u201d (AX A). \nThe Security Coordinator for Applicant\u2019s unit at the defense contractor has worked with\nApplicant for about 20 years and states the following:\nI feel that [Applicant] has been a very conscientious and trustworthy employee and\ncoworker  and has handled Security matters with proper procedures and seriousness.\nI feel that [Applicant] is a person I consider as an asset [to the company] and to this\ncountry of ours (AX B, dated February 13, 2007).\nA third coworker \u201cbelieves [Applicant] to be a good man with high moral standards. He does\na good job and would be a valuable asset to the company if he is granted a security clearance. I know\nhim well and in my opinion, he would never be a security risk to the U.S.\u201d (AX C).\nA fourth coworker has known  Applicant for about 18 months and views Applicant as a\n\u201cgood worker with strong moral standards . . . He cares deeply about his family and their education.\nAll in all, he is dedicated to the well being of this nation\u201d (AX D).   \nOfficial documents submitted by the Government (Official Notice (ON) Documents 2, 3, and\n4) state that Applicant\u2019s home country is a developing democracy that as yet provides little political\nfreedom for its citizens.  Terrorist activity has targeted western tourists. Security forces often\nquestion citizens seen talking to foreign visitors or residents.  In addition, dual Tunisian-U.S. citizens\nare expected to use a Tunisian passport to enter and leave that country and, if a Tunisian-American\nsucceeds in entering Tunisia using a U.S. passport, he or she will still have to present a Tunisian\npassport to exit the country.     \n \nPOLICIES\nViewed in an overall context, under E2.2.3.of the Directive, the ultimate determination of\nwhether the granting or continuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful\nconsideration of the following, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person.\n\n5\nExplained further below (emphasis added): \n \nThe Whole Person Concept: Under E2.2.1., the DoD adjudicative process is an examination\nof a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines. The adjudicative process is the careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence; \nAn  Administrative Judge must also consider the Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions\nfor the specific Guideline(s) cited in the SOR. In the present case, only Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence) is alleged.\nCONCLUSIONS \nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nApplicant previously stated a willingness to renounce his Tunisian citizenship (Tr at 32), but\nhe recently renewed his Tunisian passport in order to visit his family in that country and intends to\ndo so in the future.  That intent indicates that he is currently not willing to surrender his Tunisian\npassport (TR 32, 33 and GX 3).  He understands that the Directive makes the possession of a foreign\npassport a disqualifying condition (Tr at 33).  Nevertheless, he renewed his Tunisian passport in\nSeptember 2006, some 20 years after becoming a U.S. citizen and about 18 months after completing\nhis SF 86 in 2005.  The evidence establishes that Tunisia requires anyone that country considers to\nbe a Tunisian citizen to present a Tunisian passport to enter and leave that country.  He has presented\nboth his U.S. and Tunisian passports when he enters Tunisia, but only his Tunisian passport is\nstamped (Tr at 33, 34).  The only exception was in 2006, when he did not have a valid Tunisian\npassport.  He was allowed to enter, but had to obtain a special exit permit in order to leave the\ncountry.  He intends to visit Tunisia in the future and intends to retain his valid Tunisian passport\nin order to facilitate his travel there (Tr at 36, 37).  All such travel has been to visit his family (Tr\nat 36).  During his 2006 visit to Tunisia, he was questioned or interrogated for about \u201c2 \u00bd hours\u201d\nby representatives of the Tunisian Ministry of Interior (Tr at 38, 39), including questions about\nwhether he might be a threat to that country.\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. \n\n6\nDisqualifying Conditions: 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This\nincludes, but is not limited to: (a) possession of a current foreign  citizenship; and (b) action to\nacquire or obtain recognition of foreign citizenship by a U.S. citizen, such as renewing a passport.\nMitigating Conditions: 11. None that are established by the record; e.g., (a) Applicant\u2019s dual\ncitizenship began with his parents' citizenship or his birth in a foreign country, but he has confirmed\nthat dual citizenship by obtaining a foreign passport; (b) while Applicant earlier expressed a\nwillingness to renounce his dual citizenship, his stated intention to retain his Tunisian passport\nmakes his earlier statement of willingness no longer credible.  \nGuidelines in the Directive are based on DoD\u2019s long experience with cases involving similar\nfacts and circumstances, and I am required to applying my findings of fact to those guidelines.  There\nis no question that Applicant is and intends to remain a dual U.S./Tunisian citizen and that he\npossesses and recently renewed his Tunisian passport.  I have considered his rationale for retaining\nhis Tunisian citizenship and passport, essentially to allow him to visit his parents.  While his choice\nis understandable, it also means he falls within both disqualifying conditions cited above.  He has\nfailed to establish the applicability of any parallel mitigating condition, in that he has not currently\nand explicitly expressed a willingness to renounce his Tunisian citizenship, nor has he surrendered\nhis Tunisian passport.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe existence and status of the family members cited in the SOR, and admitted to by\nApplicant, not only clearly establishes the existence of close ties, but establishes a significantly\nhigher risk than appears in most cases involving Guideline B issues.  He has a mother, to whom he\nprovides financial support; and other siblings and in-laws who are citizens and residents of Tunisia,\nand a relative who is a citizen of Tunisia and resides in the U.S.  The status of two relatives; with\nconnections to the Tunisian government, necessarily raises the risk level even higher than it would\nbe with relatives with no contacts with the agencies of the Tunisian government. \nI have carefully evaluated the above information in the context of the status of the other\ncountry being Tunisia,  specifically in view of the U.S. Government\u2019s official positions as to Tunisia\nand its evaluation of conditions in Tunisia.  While Tunisia is generally considered friendly to the\nU.S., the U.S. Government has officially recognized the reality of the Tunisian government\u2019s\ntreatment of some of its citizens and of the presence of terrorists in that country.  As a Tunisian\ncitizen, Applicant is fully subject to Tunisian law while in that country, which places him beyond\nthe ability of the U.S. Government to offer the level of protection that it would otherwise be able to\napply on behalf of  U.S. citizens. \nDual citizenship is generally not considered a basis for revoking U.S. citizenship, which\nonce obtained becomes a right that cannot be revoked except in specific circumstances not applicable\nhere.  However, eligibility for a security clearance is not a right, but a privilege, and a person seeking\naccess to the nation\u2019s secrets has the burden of establishing his or her eligibility.  It is a  basic tenet\nof the security clearance process that any doubts, such as those created by a failure to mitigate\nspecific disqualifying conditions,  must be construed against the granting of a clearance.  \nThat is the position Applicant has created by his choices, as described above.  His quandary\n\n7\nis shown in his answer to Department Counsel\u2019s questions as to what he would do if he was asked\nto act improperly in regards to classified information (Tr at 58-60).  He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to\ndo. I probably won\u2019t go there [Tunisia],  at least if I know it\u2019s going to be serious.  I\u2019ll probably have\nto alert the system here, the Government, the State Department, or at least work, and have them\ninvestigate why they are doing these things.  \nThere is no evidence suggesting that  Applicant might intentionally act against U.S. security\ninterests.  However, this is a case where Applicant\u2019s feelings and ties to his family and relatives in\nTunisia might place him into a difficult position.  Already, he says, family members have been\nharassed in Tunisia because of Applicant\u2019s U.S. citizenship, and such conduct is likely to increase\nif it is learned that Applicant has access to U.S. secrets. \nAs I understand Applicant\u2019s state of mind, Applicant intends to continue to visit his family\nin Tunisia and need his Tunisian passport to leave that country even if he is allowed to use his U.S.\npassport to enter (Tr at 63).  Retention of the Tunisian passport necessarily means retention of his\nTunisian citizenship, so that he currently is not willing to renounce that citizenship nor to surrender\nthe foreign passport.  Retention of the Tunisian passport allows Applicant to travel anywhere without\nsuch travel appearing on his U.S. passport, therefore denying U.S. authorities the ability to detect\ntravel to countries that may be considered hostile to U.S. interests.   \nIn summary, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s choices as to his possession and use of Tunisian\ncitizenship and passports,  regardless of the reasons, indicate a less than unequivocal preference for\nthe U.S. and its security interests.   At the same time, his close ties to family members in Tunisia\nraise the level of risk that he might feel forced to choose between competing loyalties.         \nI have carefully considered the high praise and recommendation that appear in the four letters\nof recommendation provided by Applicant\u2019s coworker and the apparent absence of any security-\nrelated or other problems at work. While entitled to significant weight, the letters do not specifically\naddress the fact of Applicant\u2019s choices to retain his Tunisian citizenship and passport and do not\nmitigate the risks discussed above.     \nForeign Influence - The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign nation, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or\nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, included, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\nDisqualifying Conditions: (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen or resident in a foreign country if that risk creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, pressure, or coercion; and (h) indications that\nrepresentatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting to increase the vulnerability of the\nindividual to possible future exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nMitigating Conditions: None that are established by the record.  Overall, but particularly\n\n8\nconsidering the evidence in support of allegations 2.f., 2.h., 2.l., and 2.m, the record does not permit\na conclusion that MC (a), MC (b) and/or MC \u00a9 applies.  The number and closeness of the family\nmembers, two of whom have ties to the Tunisian government, and the questioning of Applicant by\nauthorities at the airport in Tunisia all add to the level of risk.   \nThere is no suggestion in the record that Applicant would voluntarily act against U.S. security\ninterests.  Rather, the concern is really that Tunisian authorities or other foreign agencies might put\npressure on his family members to persuade Applicant to act against U.S. security interests.  There\nis some evidence (from Applicant), that at least two relatives have or had some connection with the\nTunisian government and that his status as a U.S. citizen is known in Tunisia.  \nThere is no evidence one way or the other as to whether the relatives are susceptible to\npressure from the Tunisian government or intelligence agencies and might ask Applicant to act\nagainst U.S. security interests (ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (December 12,  2000)  at pp  8, 9; and ISCR\nCase No. 00-0485 (February 1, 2002) at p.4.  The bottom line is that Applicant wants to continue\nvisiting his family in Tunisia and intends to retain his Tunisian citizenship and passport in order to\ndo so (Tr at 43-45).  While such intentions and conduct will not affect his retention of his U.S.\ncitizenship, his choices do raise a doubt about his eligibility to hold a DoD security clearance.  \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d  If the Government\nmeets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that\ncreates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant\nto present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite\nthe existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  I conclude that the government has established a prima facie case under Guidelines B\nand C.  The burden of persuasion therefore shifts to Applicant, who is obligated to present evidence\nsufficient to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised.  For the reasons stated above,\nI conclude that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion.  \nIn summary, despite his long and praiseworthy conduct while in the U.S., there are simply\ntoo many unmitigated factors that raise questions under Guidelines B and C.  Consequently, the\nrecord compels the conclusion that he is not currently eligible for access to the nation\u2019s secrets. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n\n9\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\n.   \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.d.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.f.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.g.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.h.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.i.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.j.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.k.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.l.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.m.      \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.n.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On June 14, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising\nApplicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n\n2\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided upon the\nwritten record.  On November 29, 2006, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Barry\nM. Sax denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ntrustworthiness determination under Guidelines F and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination should be reversed\nbecause she has been an outstanding employee for eight years and has never taken anything from her\ncompany.  She also argues that there is no connection between her prior financial problems and her\nability to perform her job, and that an adverse trustworthiness determination could cause her to lose\nher job.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative\ntrustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The\nDirective's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which\nare of trustworthiness concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine\nan applicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole person analysis is not confined to the workplace.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (June 4, 2004).\nSimilarly, an applicant\u2019s need for a trustworthiness designation to keep her job is not material\nto the evaluation of her trustworthiness suitability.  The possibility that an unfavorable\ntrustworthiness determination could have adverse consequences for an applicant\u2019s job situation is\nnot relevant or material to an evaluation of the trustworthiness significance of that applicant\u2019s\nsituation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-21070 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2004).  The trustworthiness\nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties is not diminished or reduced by the fact\nthat an unfavorable trustworthiness determination could result in the loss of her job.  See, e.g, ISCR\nCase No. 06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the financial considerations and personal conduct allegations had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, she has not established that those\n\n3\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years and had deliberately failed to disclose adverse information about\nher indebtedness on her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF-85P).  At the time the case was\nsubmitted for determination she still had significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the\nJudge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June\n29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.\nThus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a trustworthiness designation is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

She has\nmitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. Eligibility fora public trust position is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 17, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\").  On August 31, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a SOR detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.\nIn a sworn statement dated September 26, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 21, 2006, and issued a notice\nof hearing on January 29, 2007. I conducted a hearing on February 15, 2007. The government\nsubmitted six exhibits (GE) which were marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6 without\nobjection. Applicant submitted three exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App\nEx A-C. Applicant testified on her own behalf. I held the record open until March 2, 2007, to allow\nApplicant to submit further documents, which she did. Applicant submitted five additional\ndocuments, which were marked and admitted without objection. Applicant also requested additional\ntime to submit further documentation. I granted her request in an Order dated March 8, 2007, and\nheld the record open until April 2, 2007. No additional documentation has been received. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.l,\nunder Guideline F. She denied any knowledge of the remaining allegations.  Applicant\u2019s admissions\n2\nare incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nGE 1(Application for position of public trust, dated August 17, 2004) at 1, 2, 5; Tr. at 18-20.\n3\nTr. at 21, 23-24, 36-45.\n4\nApp Ex H (Earnings and leave statements, dated March 2, 2007 and February 2, 2007); Tr. at 35-40.\n5\nAll SOR debts except 1.g are barred from collection by applicable statute of limitations (SL).\n6\nGE 5 (Credit report, dated October 21, 2004); and GE 6 (Credit report, dated April 17, 2006).\n7\n3\nApplicant, a 47-year-old woman seeking a position of public trust, works as a claims\nassociate for a Department of Defense contractor. She has worked for her employer for 18 years. She\nis single and is raising her godson, who is now 13 years old. She receives no child support from his\nparents. Her elderly, retired, and ill mother lives with her.3\nBeginning in 1989, Applicant experienced several medical problems, which caused her to\nmiss time from work and incur medical bills. Most recently, she underwent surgery in 2001 and\nagain in 2002. She missed significant time from work after each surgery. She lost salary and incurred\nmedical expenses not covered by her health insurance. Subsequent to her surgery in 2002, her doctor\ndiagnosed diabetes. She also developed diabetic neuropathy, diverticulosis, and esophagitis. Her\ndoctor prescribed six medications, including neurontin, a muscle relaxer, and glucophage, all of\nwhich she takes daily. She recently changed health care plans, which reduced her prescription drug\ncosts from about $300 a month to approximately $180 a month, plus the $40 monthly cost for\ndiabetic testing strips.4\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly pay is $2,334 plus occasional overtime. Her net monthly pay\nvaries, but is approximately $1,475. Her monthly expenses include $400 for food, $440 for utilities,\n$120 for gasoline, $125 for a loan, $260 for medical expenses and prescriptions, and $65 for\nmiscellaneous expenses. Her total monthly expenses of $1,410 leave about $65 a month to pay her\ndebts.5\nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated October 21, 2004, April 14, 2006, and the SOR\nshows 12 unpaid debts totaling $24,189.  The current status of these debts is as follows:\n6\n7\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT, DATE\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n1.a\nMedical bill (2002)\n$     708.00\nUnpaid (barred SL)\n1.b.\nCredit card (2002)\n$  1,358.00\nUnpaid (barred SL)\n1.c.\nCollection account (2002)\n(unidentified creditor)\n$  1,383.00\nUnpaid (barred SL), not\nestablished\n1.d.\nCollection account (2003)\n(unidentified creditor)\n$  2,444.00\nUnpaid (barred SL) not\nestablished\n1.e.\ntelephone account (2003)\n$     696.00\n(originally $342)\nUnpaid, disputes\n\nThis debt is not listed on either credit report.

The creditor declined to accept her offer;\ninstead the creditor demanded that she pay the full past due amount or her car would be repossessed.\nShe could not pay the full overdue amount. She did not recognized many of the unidentified debts\nlisted in the SOR. She contacted several financial counseling agencies by telephone, but has not\nretained a counseling service. Her credit reports reflect that she has paid other debt in a timely\nmanner.10\nApplicant\u2019s last three performance reviews  consistently reflect that she performs her work\nat the \u201csometimes exceeds expectations\u201d level. Her co-workers and friends describe her as friendly,\ndependable, trustworthy and a team player. During her 18 years of employment, she has never been\ndisciplined for, nor has she violated, company rules and regulations regarding beneficiary privacy.\nShe scrupulously follows the rules in the work place.11\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\n\n Department of the Navy v.

Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly\nin one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other\naspects of life.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n13\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d, and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n14\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n15\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n16\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n17\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n18\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n19\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant\u2019s case as to allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and\n1.j. Based on the credit reports of record, I find 1.d. and 1.l are the same debt, the amount owed is\n$2,444, and these FC DC apply to the allegation. Given the length of time these debts have existed,\nApplicant has a history of not paying her debts. The debts remain unpaid, therefore, she has either\nbeen unwilling or unable to pay these debts.\nThe government has not established its case as to allegations 1.c, 1.d., 1.f, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l.\nAlthough she initially admitted the debts identified in these allegations, Applicant denied these debts\nat the hearing because she did not know to whom she owed this money. These allegations either do\nnot identify the name of the creditor or simply list a credit collection agency, without identifying the\nunderlying creditor. Thus, Applicant is not on notice as to whom she owes these debts and cannot\nmake any inquiries to pay the debt. The debt identified in allegation 1.k is not listed on either credit\nreport. The government has not established through its evidence that these debts belong to Applicant\nbecause the credit reports lack sufficient information to give Applicant notice as to whom she owes\nmoney.\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). FC MC\nE2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated) do\nnot apply because Applicant has numerous, delinquent financial accounts which are several years old.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation)) applies. In 2001 and 2002, Applicant incurred financial losses\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n20\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nbecause of medical problems. She missed significant time from work while convalescing from\nsurgery. She lost income as her absence was not fully covered by her accumulated leave and company\nleave policies. Although she had medical insurance, it did not pay all her medical expenses, leaving\na portion of the bills for her to pay.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply.\nAlthough Applicant contacted several financial counseling agencies, she did not retain a service and\nreceive financial counseling.\nFC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable as Applicant has not made any effort to resolve her\noutstanding debt issues.\nShe does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the application\nof the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations, which applies to all the SOR debts established by\nthe government, except allegation 1.g. See S.C. Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.  The South Carolina Court\n20\nof Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of\nlimitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App.\n2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nElimination of most of her delinquent debt load through the statute of limitations has ended\nher potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer \u201cfinancially\noverextended,\u201d but it does not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding debts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n21\n8\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant has worked for 18 years for her current employer, a Defense Department contractor.\nShe has followed company rules and has not violated the privacy rights of the beneficiaries she serves.\nShe performs her job well and is respected by her co-workers and friends. She undertook the\nresponsibility of raising a godson 13 years ago. Applicant is a responsible individual, who has\nmaintained the same employment for many years and who follows the general rules of society. She\ndoes not have a police record or problems with drugs or alcohol.\nAbout six years ago, her medical problems became more severe and required surgery to\nresolve. She lost time from work, for which she received less than full pay. She also incurred medical\ndebt, which she could not pay. Her current income level leaves little room for her to repay her old\ndebts. She does keep current on her living expenses and has timely paid many of her bills in the past.\nExcept for the money still due on her car repossession, she has no debt for which she is legally\nresponsible. She got behind in her car payments, not because she spent money frivolously or\nunwisely, but simply because her income level would not cover both her car payment and her\nunexpected medical expenses. She attempted to resolve the missed car payments, but the creditor\nrefused to work with her. She did not avoid paying her bills; she simply had no extra money to pay\nthese extra expenses. The absence of significant, new delinquent debt over in two years and a change\nin health plans to help pay her medical expenses are additional factors which evidence rehabilitation,\npositive behavior changes, and self-discipline in regards to her finances. The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress is low because she is current on her recent debts, and has been\nsteadily employed for the last 18 years. She is very conscious of her income limitations and has shown\nan ability to live within her monthly income. Unexpected losses in income or unexpected bills have\na significant and immediate impact on her finances. Her attitude about her finances and her adherence\nto her budget support a determination of trustworthiness.\nIn sum, in the absence of unanticipated and unusual expenses, the likelihood of new debt\nproblems is low. Although all of the SOR debts remain unpaid, there is little likelihood that this\nunpaid debt would present a security clearance problem as she is not legally liable for 11 of these\ndebts under state law, four of which were not established as hers and two of which are duplicates of\nother identified debts. She is a long-term employee with a good performance record. She has not been\ndisciplined for violation of patient privacy issues and there is little likelihood she would violate these\nprivacy rights because of her existing debt problems. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person,  I conclude she\n21\nhas mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n9\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-l\n      For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\ndesignation.   Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was prejudiced; and\nwhether the Judge erred by concluding the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F had not been\nmitigated.\n(1) Applicant makes the general argument that the Judge was prejudiced.  The Board does\nnot find this argument persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nbiased or prejudiced against Applicant.  Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any\nindication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness\nand impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).\nBias or prejudice is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached\nunfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0954 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 1995).\nMoreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error, standing\nalone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudiced.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0515\nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 1999).  Applicant has not met her heavy burden of persuasion, in that she\nfails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person\nto conclude that the Judge was prejudiced.\n(2)  Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns\nraised by her history of financial difficulties had not been mitigated, because her indebtedness was\ndue to loss of employment and an injury, and she had stated she would pay off the debts.  Applicant\ncontends that the Judge mis-characterized the evidence in his findings.   The Board does not find\nApplicant\u2019s contentions persuasive.\nThe findings which Applicant challenges are permissible characterizations by the Judge.\nApplicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect\nto her conduct of trustworthiness concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of\nthe record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of\ntrustworthiness concern are sustainable.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 05-03939 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept.1, 2006).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\n\n3\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating factors. The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to seven of the SOR factual\nallegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 03-14873 at 2 (App.\nBd. Sept. 28, 2006).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was before\nhim, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination is sustainable.  Thus, the\nAdministrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant access to automated information systems in\nADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems in\nADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThe method and scope of background investigations are outside the scope of review of the\nAppeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0293 at 4 (App. Bd. May 5, 2000).  The hearing is the\nApplicant\u2019s opportunity to produce other evidence beyond that developed by his background\ninvestigation for the purpose of rebutting, explaining, extenuating, or mitigating facts to which he\nhas admitted or which have been proven by Department Counsel.  See, e.g., Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The\nJudge is then duty bound to consider all of the evidence developed on the record of the case before\nhim.  Any attempt on the part of the judge to independently investigate allegations or develop facts\nwould, of course, conflict with the judge\u2019s role as an impartial fact finder.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n02-32606 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2004).\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nbiased or unfair.  Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in\na manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).  Lack of partiality is not\ndemonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached unfavorable conclusions.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0954 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 1995).  Moreover, even if an appealing\nparty demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error, standing alone, does not demonstrate the\nJudge was biased or unfair.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0515 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 1999).  \nApplicant has not met the heavy burden of persuasion noted above, in that he fails to identify\nanything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to question\nthe fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2\n(App. Bd. June 6, 2006).\n(2) Applicant contends that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised\nby his multiple unpaid debts was mitigated because his debts were largely the result of circumstances\nbeyond his control\u2014loss of employment and unexpected medical expenses; they were isolated\nincidents that were not recent; and Applicant has received counseling and there are indications that\nthe problem is under control.  In support of his contention, Applicant essentially reargues his case\n\nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Accordingly, we may not\n1\nconsider Applicant\u2019s additional explanations, and they do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\n3\nwith respect to the evidence he presented at the hearing and provides addition statements as to his\ncurrent financial situation.   Applicants\u2019 arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \n1\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, he still had\nsignificant outstanding debts and had only recently begun to repay his debts.  In light of the\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent, not\nisolated, and still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He has taken little action to address this debt. Clearance is denied.\n \n\nExhibit 2, page 9.\n1\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 24, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 23, 2006. The case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on October 6, 2006. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 16, 2006, and the\nhearing was held on November 7, 2006. The transcript was received on November 28, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 37 years of age. He has been employed by the same defense contractor since\nAugust 2004.\nSOR Allegation 1a: In December 2003, a State tax lien in the amount of $1,575.00 was filed\nagainst applicant. This tax debt arose from tax year 2001. Applicant testified that he incurred this\ndebt because he misfiled his return as \u201cHead of Household\u201d instead of \u201cMarried with One Child.\u201d\nHe further testified that although he probably first learned of the debt in the summer of 2004, he did\nnot contact the creditor until the summer of 2005. He further testified that after a series of\nconversations with the creditor, he was advised that he could still file an amended tax return. He\nintends to file the amended tax return, and according to his calculations, when he does, the debt will\ndisappear and he will be due a refund (Exhibit B; TR at 64-67).\nSOR Allegation 1b: In his response to the SOR, applicant admitted that he had been\nindebted to this creditor in the amount of $76.00, and stated that the debt \u201chas been paid in full\u201d and\nthat it was \u201can oversight.\u201d At the hearing he testified that he did not know what the debt was for, but\nif he said in his response to the SOR that he paid it, then he paid it. He offered no documentation to\ncorroborate his testimony that the debt was paid.\nSOR Allegation 1c: Applicant has been indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount\nof $348.00 since 2001. In his response to the SOR, he stated, \u201cI intend to pay this account in full\nwithin the next 90 days.\u201d At the hearing, he testified that the debt has not been paid, and that he has\nnot had any recent communications with the creditor (TR at 75).\nSOR Allegation 1d: Applicant denies this $585.00 debt. Although the current creditor is\nlisted as Certified Recovery Systems, a collection agency, the debt originated with Ameriloan,1\nwhich according to applicant is a check cashing company that he never did business with.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony was credible and worthy of belief.\n\n3\nSOR Allegation 1e: In 2001, applicant had an automobile repossessed. As a result, he\nbecame indebted to the creditor in the amount of approximately $7,022.00. In August 2006, he wrote\na letter to the current creditor requesting an opportunity to discuss his \u201coptions regarding the debt\u201d\n(Exhibit E). At the hearing, he testified that he intends to get to the bottom of the debt and take care\nof it (TR at 83).\nSOR Allegations 1f, 1g, 1i, 1p, 1q and 1r: In his response to the SOR, applicant admitted\nhe is indebted to these creditors in the total amount of approximately $21,610.00, and stated these\ndebts arose from an eye surgery he had in 2003 because of complications from diabetes. He further\nstated that because the insurance company initially approved the surgery and then denied\nreimbursement after the fact, he does not feel responsible for these debts, all of which have been\nplaced for collection. Less than a week before the hearing, applicant wrote a letter to a couple of the\ncreditors asking for information about the debts (Exhibits F and G). These debts have been\ndelinquent for at least a couple of years.\nSOR Allegation 1h: This debt appears to be a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR\nParagraph 1d.\nSOR Allegation 1j: Applicant does not believe he should have to pay this $158.00 debt\nbecause he did not get the service he contracted for with DirecTV.\nSOR Allegations 1k, 1l and 1m: These three debts were medical-related co-payments\napplicant never made. He satisfied the three debts, totaling $207.21,  in August 2006 (Exhibit A; TR\nat 97-98).\nSOR Allegation 1n: Applicant is indebted to this creditor for a judgment debt in the\napproximate amount of $2,449.00. Applicant admits he is indebted as alleged, but states the creditor\nis a con artist and liar who took advantage of him. In June 2006, he stated he did not intend to pay\nthe debt. However, now that he realizes it could affect his security clearance request, he may pay it.\nLess than a week before the hearing he wrote a letter to the creditor asking for information about the\ndebt (Exhibit H).\nSOR Allegation 1o: Applicant testified that this debt is either the same debt as alleged in\nSOR Paragraph 1d, or a similar debt in that it is from a check cashing company that he has never\ndone business with (TR at 103-104).\nApplicant testified that his financial problems started in 2001. He had been a senior executive\nat a large company that began experiencing financial problems. These problems were compounded\nby the fact the chief executive officer started stealing from the company. Applicant eventually lost\nhis health insurance and then his paychecks started bouncing. He lost his job in July or August 2001,\nand remained unemployed until July 2002 (TR at 58-61; Exhibit 1). He has been trying to make ends\nmeet since then. At the present time, his monthly income is roughly equivalent to his monthly\nexpenses. Some months he has a positive cash flow, other months he does not (TR at 115-116).\nApplicant testified, and stated in Exhibit P, that he comes from a wealthy family and that,\nalthough he does not have the money to pay all of his delinquent debts at once, if it came down to\n\n4\nlosing his job, he would \u201cget the money\u201d (TR at 96, 121-122).\nThree military officers who work with applicant, including the Deputy Commander at\napplicant\u2019s place of employment, appeared at the hearing. These witnesses testified that applicant\nis reliable and trustworthy. One of these witnesses described the questioning of applicant\u2019s security-\nworthiness as \u201cridiculous,\u201d and another described it as \u201csilly\u201d (TR at 41 and 47).\nNumerous letters offering support for applicant were admitted into evidence.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that (1) applicant has been experiencing significant financial\ndifficulties since 2001, (2) he is still indebted to numerous creditors for past-due debts in the\napproximate total amount of $30,000.00 (after giving him the benefit of the doubt on debts alleged\nin SOR Paragraphs 1a, 1b, 1d, 1h, 1j, and 1o),  and (3) except for satisfying three small debts to the\nsame creditor totaling $207.21 in August 2006, and writing letters to some of his creditors after the\nissuance of the SOR, he has done little or nothing to address this approximately $30,000.00 in past-\ndue indebtedness. Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations reflects adversely on his\njudgment and reliability, and suggests he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified information.\nWith respect to the Financial Considerations guideline, Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) are applicable.\nApplicant offered credible evidence that his financial problems were caused by the loss of\nhis employment, which was largely beyond his control. He therefore qualifies for Mitigating\nCondition E2.A6.1.3.3 (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol, e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation).  Based on his long-standing failure to address the bulk of his indebtedness\nin any meaningful way, he clearly does not qualify for Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.6 (the\nindividual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAt the present time, applicant is getting by financially, but not by much. He testified that\nsome months he has a positive cash flow, and other months he does not. In this regard, he is no\ndifferent than many people holding security clearances. What makes applicant\u2019s situation different\nis that he also has approximately $30,000.00 in unsecured debt that has been past-due for years. He\ntestified that he could get the money to satisfy this debt from wealthy family members if necessary\nto save his job. If true, the time to do that was before the hearing. A decision in this case cannot be\nbased on speculation that applicant may be bailed out by family members in the future.\nGiven the amount of unsecured past-due debt applicant has been carrying for years, the lack\nof any real effort to address it, and the lack of any credible, definitive plan to reduce this debt\nanytime soon, it is not now clearly consistent with the national interest for applicant to have access\nto classified information.\n\n5\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant owed about $3,650 in delinquent debt that she intentionally did not report when\nshe completed her security clearance application in October 2003. Nor did she disclose criminal drug\ncharges filed against her in January 1997 that were subsequently not prosecuted. A single mother\nwith three young children to support, Applicant candidly admitted to a government investigator in\n2005 that she had lied to protect her job. She has expressed deep remorse for the SF 86 falsifications,\nsettled or paid in full most of her delinquent debts, and has not incurred any recent delinquency.\nClearance is granted.\n\nIn the SOR, DOHA cited the police record inquiry only by its number and did not include the specific question\n1\nApplicant was alleged to have falsified. The specific language of question 23d is as follows: \u201cHave you ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d (Item 4)\nSOR \u00b6 2.e does not represent a separate incident of falsification. Rather, DOHA alleged the evidence upon\n2\nwhich the government relies to prove the knowing and willful concealment of her delinquent accounts from her SF 86.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 12, 2006, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\nGuideline E (personal conduct) of the adjudicative guidelines (AG). Applicant answered the SOR\non June 23, 2006, and elected a determination on the written record without a hearing.\nOn February 15, 2007, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\nconsisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). By letter of February 20, 2007, DOHA forwarded a copy of\nthe FORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. On March 24, 2007,\nApplicant filed her rebuttal to the FORM. Department Counsel did not object to her response, and\non April 16, 2007, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owed unpaid judgment debts of $294 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a) and $507 (\u00b6 1.b), three debts in collection totaling $2,941 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f), and one\ncharged off consumer credit debt of $969 (\u00b6 1.d), and that her monthly expenses exceeded her net\nincome as of April 14, 2005 (\u00b6 1.g). Applicant was alleged under Guideline E to have deliberately\nfalsified her October 29, 2003, security clearance application (SF 86) by responding negatively to\nquestions about any unpaid judgments in the past seven years (\u00b6 2.a), any debts over 180 days\ndelinquent in the past seven years (\u00b6 2.b), and any debts then over 90 days delinquent (\u00b6 2.c). DOHA\nalso alleged she intentionally did not disclose her arrest in January 1997 for disorderly conduct,\npossession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia, in response to police record inquiry\nquestion 23d (\u00b6 2.d).  DOHA also alleged under Guideline E that Applicant had stated under oath\n1\nduring an interview of April 14, 2005, that she was aware of her delinquent accounts when she\ncompleted her SF 86 and that she chose to not list them as she feared she would lose her job (\u00b6 2.e).2\nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted she still owed the delinquent debts, that her monthly\nexpenses exceed her income, and that she had falsified her SF 86 as alleged. A single mother with\nthree children and on public assistance at the time, she explained that she needed the job and was\nafraid to disclose the indebtedness and the arrest. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as\nfacts. After a thorough review of the evidence before me for consideration, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\n\nThere is nothing in the record indicating what job Applicant holds with the defense contractor or what level\n3\nof clearance she requires for her duties.\nAs noted by the government in the FORM, the account went to collection. There is no evidence that the creditor\n4\nwas awarded a civil judgment.\nFrom the account history, it appears that it was a Sears account with a high credit of $860 that was sold or\n5\ntransferred in August 2000. By April 2001, the holder of the account (listed as RSKMGTALRP) had placed it for\ncollection in the amount of $1,136. From the most recent credit report, it appears it was placed with 1  Select in March\nst\n2001. In December 2002, it was picked up by Associates, which then placed it for collection with CREDRECINC by\nMay 2003 with a balance of $1,333. By January 2007, the balance of the debt was $1,785.\n4\nApplicant is a 33-year-old single mother with three children aged 13, 11, and 10. A high\nschool graduate who is employed by a defense contractor, she seeks a security clearance for her\nduties.3\nApplicant earned her high school diploma in 1992. It is not clear in the record whether she\nwas employed before she began attending a local vocational/technical school in the late 1990s. She\ncompleted her training in July 1999. The following October, she started working as an administrative\nassistant for a staffing services agency. Unemployed from March 2001 to May 2002, she secured\nemployment as an administrative assistant at a local hospital, but stayed only a few months. In\nSeptember 2002, she began working for her sister as a hairstylist. There is no record information\nabout her income from these jobs.\nApplicant applied to work for a defense contractor in about October 2003. She was on public\nassistance at the time. In conjunction with her application, Applicant executed a  Questionnaire for\nNational Security Positions (SF 86) on October 29, 2003. She responded negatively to inquiries\nconcerning whether she had a police record, including question 23d. \u201cHave you ever been charged\nwith or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to\nquestions about her financial record and any delinquencies, including 27d. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have\nyou had any judgments against you that have not been paid?,\u201d 28a. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d and 28b. \u201cAre you currently over 80 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d\nAn investigation of Applicant\u2019s background revealed that Applicant had been arrested in\nJanuary 1997 for disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia,\nbut the charges had been nolle prossed in May 1998. A June 11, 2004, credit check disclosed she was\ndelinquent on some financial accounts. A cable television debt of $294 had been in collection since\nNovember 2001 (\u00b6 1.a).  A department store revolving charge debt of about $860 fell more than 120\n4\ndays past due and was sold or transferred in August 2000. As of August 2002, the account was in\ncollection with a balance of $1,136 (\u00b6 1.c and 1.f, same account).  A medical debt of $150 had been\n5\nin collection since November 1998 (\u00b6 1.e). A VISA card account held since March 2000 was placed\nfor collection in August 2000 in the amount of $969. As of May 2004, the assignee reported a past\ndue balance of $1,012 (\u00b6 1.d). An overdue retail charge account balance of $594 was sold in August\n2000 to this same assignee who reported a debt balance of $653 as of May 2004 (not alleged). A\n$507 judgment had been awarded a department store in November 2001 on a debt that had been in\ncollection since June 2000 (\u00b6 1.b).  Applicant was reportedly making her $50 monthly payments on\na student loan of $5,061 that she had taken out in January 1999. The loan balance was $5,025 as of\n\n5\nMay 2004. A second student loan of $1,392, taken out in September 2001, was too new to rate as\nof November 2001 and no new information had been obtained on the account.\nIn January 2005, the collection agency handling the $1,012 (\u00b6 1.d) and $653 (not alleged)\ndebts agreed to settle for lump sum payments of $528.02 and $338.70. Payment due dates were\nFebruary 9, 2005, and February 17, 2005, respectively. On February 14, 2005, Applicant paid $530\nand $340 by postal money order to settle the two accounts.\nOn April 14, 2005, Applicant was interviewed about her financial situation and her failure\nto list her delinquent accounts on her SF 86. Applicant admitted that she had been aware of her\ndelinquent accounts and that she should have listed them on her security clearance application, but\nthat she feared she would lose the job she needed if she disclosed them. Applicant explained that her\nmonthly expenses and payments exceeded her net monthly income.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on May 8, 2006, revealed she had been making her student loan\npayments. She had reduced the balance of the $5,061 loan to $4,268 and had paid off the other, but\nhad made no progress toward resolving the $294 cable television debt in collection (\u00b6 1.a), or the\n$507 judgment debt (\u00b6 1.b). Applicant was also reportedly past due on the debt in \u00b6 1.f (\u00b6 1.c same\ndebt). Her credit report showed no new credit card accounts and no recent reliance on credit.\nIn about June 2006, the collection agency that had purchased her defaulted medical debt of\n$150 (\u00b6 1.d) offered three settlement plans. Applicant could pay $60 in a lump sum payment, three\nequal consecutive monthly payments totaling $105 within 90 days, or the full balance in affordable\nmonthly installments. Applicant paid $60 by debit card from her bank account on July 5, 2006. \nA check of her credit on February 15, 2007, continued to show as unpaid the cable debt as\nin collection (\u00b6 1.a), and a $1,758 balance owed on \u00b6 1.f (\u00b6 1.c same debt). It provided no updates\ninformation about the status of the $507 judgment debt (\u00b6 1.b).\nIn an effort to address the government\u2019s concerns about her failure to pay her delinquent\nobligations, Applicant paid $432 on March 23, 2007, to the creditor now owed the debt in \u00b6 1.b. She\nrelied on consumer credit to pay the $294.50 owed the cable television company (\u00b6 1.a). Applicant\npresented a portion of a recent credit report showing that her student loan was in good standing with\na balance of $4,175.\nIn her rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant \u201cdeeply\u201d apologized on March 24, 2007, for having\nbeen untruthful on her SF 86 about her credit history and police record. Referring to her submitted\nevidence of payments, some for less than full balance in settlement, Applicant indicated that the\nbalance of the debt in \u00b6 1.f (\u00b6 1.c same debt) would be resolved soon and that she intended to\n\u201ccontinue working hard at keeping a good credit record.\u201d As for her arrest, Applicant explained that\nshe had been \u201cat the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d; that she had on a friend\u2019s coat that night\n(\u201cplease believe if I knew what was inside I would not have put the coat on before ask [sic] to get\nout of the car by the police.\u201d).

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe adjudicative guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds. AG \u00b6 E2.A6.1.1. Applicant\u2019s June 2004 credit report listed unpaid judgment debt\nof $507 awarded against her in November 2001, and other outstanding debt totaling $3,245 incurred\nin or before August 2000. As a single mother with three minor children, Applicant faced significant\nfinancial pressures even after she started working for the defense contractor. As of April 2005, her\nincome was insufficient to cover her expenses. Disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 E2.A6.1.2.1, A\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations, and \u00b6 E2.A6.1.2.3, Inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts, apply.\nApplicant did not persuasively establish that the delinquent debt was incurred due to\nunforeseen circumstances of the type contemplated in mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.3, The\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation). Only $150 of the debt was medical; the rest was consumer credit debt incurred by\nchoice. However, Applicant\u2019s unemployment from March 2001 to May 2002 is a factor that could\nmitigate her failure to make any payments toward her debts after they became delinquent. While it\nis not clear whether she was laid off from her job with the staffing agency or she resigned, she lacked\nthe income to satisfy her old debts, as evidenced by her acceptance of public assistance. \nApplicant has taken sufficient steps to address her indebtedness since 2005 to apply\nmitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.6, The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, in her favor. After she completed her SF 86, but before\n\n7\nher subject interview, she paid $870 by postal money order in February 2005 to settle two of her\ndebts, including the debt in \u00b6 1.d. It is not clear whether she had saved the funds or borrowed them,\nbut there is no evidence that she incurred new delinquent debt despite her monthly payments\nexceeded her income as of that April. She is also credited with settling the medical debt in \u00b6 1.a in\nJuly 2006, and with making regular payments on her student loans. More recent payments in March\n2007 of $432 (\u00b6 1.b) and $294.50 (\u00b6 1.a) have brought those accounts current, although  to the extent\nthat Applicant relied on credit to make the payment, she is still in debt, albeit to a different creditor.\nAs of late March 2007, Applicant had not made any payments on the debt in \u00b6 1.f (\u00b6 1.c same\ndebt), and with interest and/or collection fees the debt had risen to about $1,785. Yet, the Directive\ndoes not require that one be debt free before being granted access. Given her efforts to resolve her\ndelinquent indebtedness, the absence of any new delinquent debt, and her track record of repayment\nof her student loans, I conclude she can be counted on to continue to address her old accounts\nprovided she has the income to do so. The financial debts that remain are surmountable.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. AG \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1. The government contends, and\nApplicant admits, that she falsified her SF 86 by not disclosing her January 1997 arrest on drug\ncharges in response to question 23d (any drug or alcohol-related charges), the November 2001\nfinancial judgment awarded the creditor in \u00b6 1.b in response to question 27d (any judgments in the\npast seven years that are unpaid), or her delinquent debts in response to questions 28a (debts over\n180 days delinquent in the past seven years) and 28b (debts currently over 90 days delinquent). DC\n\u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.2, The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies.\nApplicant elected to not disclose the charges or debts because she feared loss of the job if she\ndid so. Acknowledging the desperate situation that she was in as a single mother supporting three\nchildren on public assistance, Applicant\u2019s obligation of full candor transcends her personal\ncircumstances, however dire. There is no mitigating condition for necessity. The false statements\nwere isolated to one clearance application more than three years ago, but the DOHA Appeal Board\nhas held that MC \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.2, The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the\nindividual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily, does not apply where the\nrectification involves the same subject matter as the falsification. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0557,\nApp. Bd. Jul. 10, 2000, reaffirmed ISCR Case No. 01-06166, App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2001). Where a case\ninvolves disclosures by an applicant that are corrections of an earlier falsification, \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.3,\nThe individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted\nwith the facts, rather than \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.2 is proper for consideration. On April 14, 2005, Applicant\nadmitted under oath to a government investigator that she had lied on her SF 86 to protect her job.\nThe record does not contain an affidavit or statement from Applicant or a report from the investigator\ndetailing what was discussed. Absent evidence that the omitted arrest and debt information was\nvolunteered by Applicant before confrontation, I am unable to conclude that MC \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.3\n\n8\napplies. A rectification in April 2005 of October 2003 misrepresentations cannot reasonably be\ncharacterized as prompt. None of the other mitigating conditions are pertinent.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. \u00b6 E2.2.1. While\nfinancial delinquency and especially deliberate false statements raise very significant concerns about\na clearance applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness (see \u00b6 E2.2.1.1, The nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; \u00b6 E2.2.1.3, The frequency and recency of the conduct), her life\ncircumstances cannot be ignored. Not yet 20 when she had her first child, Applicant had two more\nchildren out of wedlock before she turned 24, whom she had to support. She was out of work for\nover a year at one point and on public assistance before going to work for the defense contractor.\nWhile she was 30 when she falsified her SF 86 (\u00b6 E2.2.1.4, The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct), and clearly acted in self-interest (\u00b6 E2.2.1.8, The motivation for the conduct),\nApplicant took responsibility for the lies during her interview with the government investigator (\u00b6\nE2.2.1.6, The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes). Not\nonly has she twice apologized for her misconduct, but she has taken steps to improve her financial\nsituation by staying on with the defense contractor for over three years, making regular payments on\nher student loans, settling several of the delinquent debts, some before the SOR was issued, and\nincurring no new delinquent debt. While her false statements are not condoned, security clearance\ndeterminations are not designed to punish applicants, but rather involve an assessment of future risk,\nand there is likely to be no recurrence (\u00b6 E2.2.1.9, The likelihood of continuation or recurrence).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDustin N. Thomas, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant did not timely file federal and state taxes for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 until\nApril 2007. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and state tax return has been mitigated due to his\nwife\u2019s serious health conditions, his diagnosis of cancer, and his move. Applicant has maintained\na security clearance for more than thirty years without incident. Under the whole person analysis, he\nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concern and the personal conduct security\nconcern. Clearance is granted.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated May 2007.\n2\nGX 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated December 19, 2003).\n3\nId.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleges  security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\n1\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. The SOR\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nOn May 2, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On June 18, 2007, the case was assigned to me. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on July 12, 2007. At the August 1, 2007 hearing, the Government\nintroduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1-4  into evidence without objections. Applicant testified and\nintroduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A-D into evidence without objections from Department\nCounsel. DOHA received the transcript on August 10, 2007. At Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record\nopen until August 8, 2007. Applicant timely filed a packet of documentation. This submission was\nmarked and entered into the record as AX E. Department Counsel had no objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations in his SOR response under Guideline F. He denied the\nallegation under Guideline E.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\n2\nconsideration, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a-75-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduation from college,\nhe served in the military from 1953 until his honorable discharge in 1973. While in the military, he\nhad a top-secret security clearance. Applicant received a graduate degree in business in 1972. He has\nworked for his current employer since January 2002. Applicant is married with two adult children.3\nOn December 19, 2003, he completed his security clearance (SF 86) application.4\nApplicant worked for a number of defense companies throughout his career, spanning more\nthan thirty years. He maintained a security clearance throughout the years  with no problems. In 2001\n\nTr. 32.\n5\nId.\n6\nAt that time, Applicant also was dealing with his 2000 taxes and a tax lien. He owed the IRS an unspecified\n7\namount. He paid the taxes. \nAX A (Chronology - Medical history)\n8\nTr. 56; 57.\n9\nTr. 34.\n10\nTr. 39.\n11\n4\nApplicant left his employment and moved to another state.  Since that time, he has worked for his\n5\ncurrent employer as a project manager.6\nApplicant did not timely file his federal and state taxes for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003.\nIn 2000, his wife developed a serious blood condition.  In 2001, she also fell and broke her wrist.\n7\nShe then had surgery and developed an infection. She has had more medical problems since then in\n2003, 2004 and 2005. After unsuccessful eye surgery, she was blind in one eye. She was in a nursing\nhome for some time because Applicant could not attend to all her medical needs.  She is living at\n8\nhome but is not ambulatory. \nWhen Applicant moved in 2001, he needed time to sort out his files and papers after they\narrived in January 2002.  His computer files contained his financial information, but the computer\n9\nhard drive failed and he lost that data in 2002. He normally prepared his own taxes using a computer\nprogram. That same year, Applicant was diagnosed with prostrate cancer.  However, he continued\n10\nto work part-time. He is presently on medication for the cancer.11\nIn 2002, Applicant was gathering his financial records in order to complete his federal and\nstate taxes. He filed for several extensions, and paid $2,000 in 2002. His wife\u2019s health continued to\ndeteriorate and he spent a great deal of time attending to her needs. In 2004, he then consulted a CPA\nto assist him with the filing of the taxes. However, Applicant was diverted due to his wife\u2019s medical\ncondition. During this time Applicant\u2019s wife was hospitalized for pneumonia. She remained\nhospitalized for a period of time and then entered rehabilitation. For several months in 2005, she was\nin a nursing home. She developed fevers and her health worsened. During Hurricane Katrina, she\nwas in the hospital for approximately one month.\nAn agent investigated Applicant  as part of the security investigation. He was open with them\nabout his situation and the fact that he was still in the process of getting things in order to file the\nfederal and state taxes. He explained that when his wife became ill, he stopped and did not attend\nto the paperwork. Not only did the 2001 and 2002 medical problems impact his organizational\nabilities, but Hurricane Katrina (2005) hindered his ability to collect his financial papers and\n\nApplicant\u2019s wife was in the hospital during Katrina for a few weeks. Due to the disruption in daily life after\n12\nthe devastation, his wife could not return to the nursing home because it was filled with hurricane victims. Applicant had\nto find a place for her where her acute needs could be met. This caused more upheaval in his life.\nAX E (Federal and State Tax Returns for 2001, 2002, and 2003). \n13\nTr.49.\n14\nTr. 52.\n15\n Department of the Navy v.

He told the investigators that he needed a bit more time to complete the\n12\nfilings.\n \nApplicant filed his federal and state taxes for 2001, 2002 and 2003 in April and May, 2007.13\nHis CPA prepared his federal taxes for the year 2001. Applicant prepared the taxes for 2002 and\n2003.  He filed his federal and state taxes for 2005 in May of 2006.  He paid his taxes in 2007.  His\n14\nreturns reflected that he owed $6,602 and $5,656. His 2003 filed return resulted in a refund for\nApplicant.\nApplicant acknowledged that he was embarrassed by his not filing his taxes in a timely\nfashion. He understands his responsibility and obligation to do so. However, he was honest in\ndetailing the events that slowed him down and prevented him from filing sooner. He even\nacknowledged that part of this involved some procrastination on his part. He was candid in the fact\nthat he was less than totally organized given the medical condition of his wife, the move and his own\nmedical condition.15\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n16\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n17\n\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n18\n Id.\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n22\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n23\nAG \u00b6 18.\n24\n6\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n18\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n19\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n20\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n21\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n22\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.23\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndeterminations as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I reach the\nfollowing conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n \nGuideline F:Financial Considerations \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.24\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n25\n7\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC 19(g) (failure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns as\nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same) apply in this case. Applicant did not timely file his\nfederal and state tax returns for 2001, 2002, and 2003, and did not pay his required taxes for 2001 and\n2002 until 2007. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant filed his federal and state taxes for 2001, 2002, and 2003 in 2007.  Applicant\nindicated the failure to file timely was partly due to the myriad medical problems that his wife has had\nbeginning in 2000 until the present and his financial records being disrupted during the 2001 move.\nHe also admitted some procrastination on his part. However, his computer hard drive failed during that\nperiod, and he also was diagnosed with cancer. He sought out his CPA to help him. The combination\nof events that occurred were beyond his control. He was slow in his tax filings but asked for extensions\nand paid $2,000 in 2002. He acknowledged that after the move, it took him awhile to get everything\ntogether and start the process. In some cases, Applicant was owed a refund. \nThe issue is whether Applicant has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination. Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns under Guideline F for the reasons stated above.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.25\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question does the\npersons\u2019s past conduct justify confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation. Not filing taxes in a timely fashion is the type of personal conduct which causes security\nconcerns. \n\n8\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities, among\nwhich is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor. Financial stability that reflects good judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely\nto inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance. Having found for Applicant as to the\nfinancial considerations concern, I find for Applicant as to personal conduct.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Applicant served his country for 20 years, and during that time he maintained\na top secret clearance. His entire civilian career was devoted to the defense industry. He has never had\nany difficulty maintaining his clearance. A combination of events occurred in 2001 that conspired to\nslow Applicant down, and thus, he did not focus completely on filing taxes. He has now paid his taxes.\nApplicant was completely cooperative and responsive in the security process. It is clear from\nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and actions that he takes this matter seriously and strongly desires to put this\nbehind him. Applicant has now filed his federal and state taxes for 2001, 2002, and 2003. He is current\nwith all tax payments. Significantly, he took action to resolve the issue before the initiation of this\naction. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",
