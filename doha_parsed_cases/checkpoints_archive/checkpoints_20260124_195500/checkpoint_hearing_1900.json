Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 19, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1990), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National. \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nAdjudicators recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n The SOR presented allegations 1.a \u2013 1.f. In an undated response, Applicant \nanswered the SOR, denying all of the allegations, except those set forth in subparagraphs \n1.a and 1.f.  He requesting a hearing, and on January 5, 2021, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. After Applicant waived his 15-\nday notice requirement, DOHA, on January 22, 2021, scheduled the hearing for January \n29, 2021. The hearing was held as scheduled. I received three Government exhibits (GE \n1 \u2013 GE 3), four Applicant exhibits (AE A - AE D) and the testimony of Applicant. In addition, \nat Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of the facts set forth in five \ndocuments (Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through HE V). At the close of the hearing, I left the \nrecord open to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he \nsubmitted one exhibit which I marked as AE E.

(GE 2 at 3) He uses it to support his \nmother\u2019s medical and living expenses when she is living in Egypt. (Tr. 26) Also, he used \nit to purchase and maintain a coffee shop in Egypt, and to make mortgage payments for \ntwo apartments that he owned in Egypt. (GE 2 at 3) He opened the bank account to avoid \nincurring international financial transfer fees that he would have incurred if he had used \na U.S. bank for his financial transactions. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant purchased the aforementioned coffee shop for $2,700 USD in 2016. (GE \n1 at 40). He co-owned it with a married couple who were Egyptian citizens and residents, \nand with his son. He used the Egyptian bank account to support the shop. He was never \ninvolved in its daily operations. (Tr. 26) Later, he sold his ownership interest in the shop. \n(Tr. 26) \nIn 2018, Applicant and his wife purchased an apartment in Egypt worth \napproximately $80,000. (Answer at 1) They never made it available for rent. They \nrenovated it with the intent of one day returning to Egypt to live there during retirement. \nAs part of their separation agreement, Applicant transferred his ownership interest to his \nwife. (AE C, AE E) Applicant is no longer interested in moving to Egypt when he retires. \nApplicant owned another apartment with his wife in Egypt. (Answer at 2) Per the \nseparation agreement, his wife transferred her ownership interest to him. (Ex. E) \nApplicant uses it as a vacation home. He travelled to Egypt three times between 2012 \nand 2014, and twice between 2017 and 2018. He has not travelled to Egypt since April \n2018. He is currently attempting to sell the apartment. It is worth approximately $30,000. \nRecently, Applicant purchased a home in the United States with his daughter. It is worth \n$185,000. (Tr. at 37) \nApplicant has approximately $90,000 deposited in U.S checking and savings \naccounts, $20,000 invested in a retirement account, and $1,000 invested in stock \naccounts. Applicant has no banking accounts or investment accounts in Egypt other than \nthe bank account discussed, above. Currently, it has a balance of less than one dollar. \n(AE D) \nAdministrative Notice \nAlthough Egypt is ostensibly a federal republic, domestic and international \norganizations have expressed concern about government limitations on association, \nassembly, and expression.(HE I at 1) Moreover, in 2017, Egypt\u2019s president consolidated \npower through a series of constitutional amendments that were approved through a \nnational referendum, which international observers concluded was corrupt. (HE I at 1) \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Cairo as being a critical-threat \nlocation for terrorism directed at, or affecting U.S. government interests. (HE II at 2) \nMultiple terrorist groups operate in Egypt. In 2019, the Egyptian parliament amended its \nanti-terrorism law, increasing punishment from ten years of incarceration for those who \npromote extremist ideology, to 15 years of incarceration. (HE II at 2) In 2019, Egypt \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstarted an academy to train imams and preachers worldwide on how to promote pluralism \nand counter extremist narratives.

(HE \nII at 3) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result in \ndivided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) \nAlthough Egypt is an important partner with the United States in fighting terrorism \nand addressing its root causes, many terrorist groups are based there, and many parts \nof Egypt are at high risk of terrorist violence. Moreover, Egypt has a troublesome history \nof human rights abuses and autocratic rule. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law and half-sister, together with his financial and real estate interests in Egypt, \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor resident in a foreign county if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d and AG \u00b6 7(f), \u201csubstantial \nbusiness financial, or property interests in a foreign country . . .that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of \ninterest.\u201d   \nApplicant and his wife are separated and a divorce is pending. When they were \ntogether, Applicant rarely talked with his mother-in-law, and has no plans of keeping in \ntouch with her once his divorce is finalized. Similarly, any acquaintances that Applicant \nhad in Egypt were friends of his soon-to-be ex-wife. He has no intention of staying in \ntouch with them in the future. Applicant and his half-sister are more than 20 years apart \nin age. They rarely have had contact over the years. The last time Applicant saw her was \nat their father\u2019s funeral in 2017, and the last time he spoke to her was in 2018. Under \nthese circumstances, AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation,\u201d applies to these relatives and contacts. \nApplicant sold his interest in the coffee shop that he owned in Egypt. As for the two \napartments Applicant owned with his wife, he transferred one of them to her as part of the \nseparation agreement, and is attempting to sell the other one. The value of the remaining \napartment and his bank account in Egypt are nominal in comparison to his assets in the \nUnited States. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the \nforeign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in \na conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual,\u201d applies. \nAssuming for the sake of argument that these minimal financial interests and \ncontacts in Egypt generate a conflict of interest, it is mitigated when compared to \nApplicant\u2019s roots in the United States that he has cultivated in the nearly 35 years that he \nhas lived here. AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe most relevant whole person factor is \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(d)(8)) In light of the casual and infrequent relationship \nwith his half-sister and his soon-to-be-former mother-in-law, his comparatively nominal \nfinancial interests in Egypt, and the amount of time he has been living in the United States, \nthe potential for pressure or coercion is minimal. Under these circumstances, I conclude \nthat Applicant has mitigated the foreign interest security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:      \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

On August 19, 2020, Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators \nwere unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \nIn an unsworn statement, dated August 31, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on November 13, 2020, and he was \nafforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on December 4, 2020. His response was due on January \n3, 2021. Applicant responded to the FORM on December 16, 2021. The case was \nassigned to me on January 21, 2021. \nRulings on Procedure \nApplicant objected to certain information and evidence submitted by Department \nCounsel pertaining to his financial consideration issues, to wit: information related to \nunsecured creditors that were included in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings, based \non his unverified contentions that those creditors had failed to file proof of claim during \nthose proceedings. For reasons discussed below, that objection is denied. He also \nobjected to information appearing in his Enhanced Subject Interview regarding alcohol \ntreatment, information to which he objected during the interview, as well as information \nregarding his continued use of a foreign passport and his intention regarding renouncing \ndual citizenship. He did not object to the admission of the Enhanced Subject Interview. \nSince there are no allegations in the SOR associated with alcohol consumption, an issue \nthat is irrelevant to this case, that objection is sustained. \nAs to the foreign passport and the dual citizenship issues, both of which were \nraised in his Enhanced Subject Interview, that objection is denied as possibly being \nrelevant and material to this case. Finally, he objected to any evidence related to \ninformation associated with, or set forth in, the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative \nNotice, discussed further below, arguing that the facts are irrelevant and argumentative \nto the case, as he has no current interests, properties or business in the country. His \nobjection is denied for reasons discussed further below. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Venezuela), \nappearing in extracts of eight U.S. Government publications that were published by the \nU.S. Department of State. Facts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily \nverifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the case.  \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 \nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See \nStein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts \nfor administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 \n(2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents). In this instance, although \nDepartment Counsel has selected only certain facts appearing in the identified \npublications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered the \npublications in their entirety. \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below \nunder the Venezuela subsection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, only one \nof the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6 1.i.), but admitted, \nwith comments, both of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a. and 2.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \nBackground \nApplicant is a 47-year-old Venezuelan-born naturalized U.S. citizen. He arrived in \nthe United States in June 1999 and was naturalized in May 2015. He is an employee of \na defense contractor, and he has been serving as an engineering manager with his \ncurrent employer since November 2018. He previously worked for a variety of employers \nin engineering management positions, and was self-employed as an engineering \nconsultant on several occasions. He received his General Education Development (GED) \ndiploma in 1991; an associate\u2019s degree in 1995; a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007; and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2011. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held \na security clearance. Applicant was married in 2001 and divorced in 2004. He remarried \nin 2006 and divorced in 2008. He remarried his first wife in 2010 and divorced in 2014. \nHe remarried in 2015. He has two children, born in 2010, and 2018. \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can \nbe found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated August 31, 2020); \nItem 3 (SF 86, dated November 29, 2018); Item 4 (Bankruptcy Court Chapter 13 Petition \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n    \n(and case file), filed December 24, 2015); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated December 29, 2018); Item 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, \ndated March 28, 2019); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated November 21, 2019); Item \n7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated November 9, 2020); and Item 2 (TransUnion Credit \nReport, dated July 7, 2020, attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR). \nApplicant has gone through repeated periods of unemployment, essentially \ncaused by reductions in force and layoffs. The initial period occurred in January 2015, \nwhen he was laid off from a position he had held since January 2008. He was unemployed \nuntil March 2015. He was employed from March 2015 until February 2016, when he was \nlaid off again. He was unemployed from February 2016 until July 2016. He considered \nhimself as self-employed from July 2016 until April 2017, when he obtained employment. \nHe was employed from April 2017 until December 2017, when his position was \neliminated. He was unemployed from December 2017 until April 2018. He considered \nhimself as self-employed from April 2018 until November 2018, when he obtained his \npresent position. (Item 3) During his periods of unemployment, he was supported by \nunemployment benefits and withdrawn retirement savings. (Item 8, at 5) \nIn December 2015, a few months before the commencement of his first period of \nunemployment, Applicant filed a Voluntary Petition for Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of \nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At the time, he estimated that he had up to 49 creditors and \nthat his liabilities were as follows: approximately $21,631 in secured claims (consisting of \na vehicle); $39,302 in priority unsecured claims (including unpaid income taxes, domestic \nsupport, and wages); and $60,272 in nonpriority unsecured claims (consisting of \ncommercial accounts, credit cards, a domestic-support lawsuit, and an overpayment of \nunemployment benefits), totaling $121,205 in total liabilities. He reported his gross \nincome from the past three years as $72,475 (2013); $81,826 (2014), and $74,844 \n(2015). He also noted that his 2015 income included gambling income totaling $7,881. \n(Item 4, at 35) He reported that he had received credit counseling in anticipation of filing \nfor bankruptcy in November 2015. (Item 4, at 8) \nOn November 14, 2016, the Trustee moved to dismiss the bankruptcy case \nbecause Applicant was delinquent in making his required payments, reporting that the \nlast payment received was in July 2016. In June 2016, the Bankruptcy Judge had ruled \nthat if the case was to be dismissed, all funds received by the Trustee prior to such \ndismissal were to be paid under the terms of the Plan to the creditors. (Item 4) On \nDecember 1, 2016, the case was ordered dismissed. (Item 4) The Trustee\u2019s Final Report \nindicated the creditors to be paid, amounts to be paid, amounts received from Applicant, \nand the actual amounts paid to specific creditors. Applicant contended that he made \nmonthly $800 payments under the Plan, starting in December 2015, but he stopped \nmaking those payments a couple of months later because of his new period of \nunemployment and the costs of his divorce and custody expenses. (Item 2; Item 8) He \npaid the Trustee $8,400, including $1,391 in administration expenses. Of the $24,044 in \nclaimed secured payments, $2,878 was actually paid. Of the $39,597 in claimed priority \nunsecured payments, $4,131 was actually paid.

During the interview, he acknowledged his delinquent \naccounts and his bankruptcy, attributing his financial difficulties to his divorce. He claimed \nthat he was willing and able to pay off his debts as soon as possible. (Item 8) \nIn December 2020, in response to the FORM, Applicant argued that once he found \nemployment in May 2017, he engaged the services of his divorce attorney to set up a \npayment plan to resolve \u201call secured debts,\u201d which he claimed included child support, \ndivorce attorney fees, alimony, and his ex-wife\u2019s attorney fees. He minimized the \nsignificance of the remaining debts by referring to them as \u201cmainly unsecured debts,\u201d and \nhe argued that they were associated with unsecured creditors who failed to file proof of \nclaim during the bankruptcy filing. (Response to the FORM, dated December 16, 2020) \nHe did not support his unverified contentions regarding the payment plan with any \ndocumentation, such as a copy of the plan, or proof of payments (such as cancelled \nchecks, bank statements, or receipts). \nIn addition to an allegation associated with the filing and dismissal of the Chapter \n13 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.i.), the SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $46,798. The accounts are set forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to an automobile loan with a high balance of $25,495 that was \ncurrent until November 2015 and was subsequently charged off in the amount of $18,854. \n(Item 5, at 10; Item 6, at 1; Item 7, at 3). The vehicle was eventually repossessed in \nDecember 2016. (Item 2 \u2013 Credit Report, at 3) The account was included in Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy as a secured liability worth $24,044, and he made payments through the \nTrustee totaling $2,878. (Item 2 \u2013 Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s Final Report) Applicant contends \nthat the vehicle was sold at public auction, leaving an unpaid balance of approximately \n$214, but that the creditor claimed the unpaid balance was $9,865, and it has refused to \nfurnish him with any documentation to support its claim. He disputed the amount, but no \nresolution has been reached. (Item 2, at 1; Item 7, at 3) There is no evidence that he \nmade the final $214 payment. While he followed through on early pre-SOR efforts to \naddress the account in bankruptcy, it does not appear that he has made any subsequent \nefforts to do so. Furthermore, it appears that he is awaiting November 2022 when the \naccount is anticipated to be removed from his credit report. (Item 2 \u2013 Credit Report, at 3) \nThe account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $5,131 that \nwas placed for collection, of which $4,499 was charged off. (Item 5, at 10; Item 6, at 2; \nItem 7, at 2-3) Applicant made his last payment to the creditor in January 2015. (Item 2 \u2013 \nCredit Report, at 3-4) The account was included in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy as an \nunsecured liability worth $5,131, but no payments were made through the Trustee. \nApplicant contends that since the creditor failed to timely file a proof of claim, he is no \nlonger responsible for the debt. He alternatively argued that since the account was \nincluded in the bankruptcy, it was placed on \u201cautomatic stay.\u201d (Item 2, at 1) He has offered \nno evidence to indicate that he has made any efforts to resolve the account since the \nbankruptcy was dismissed.

The account was included in \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy as an unsecured liability (Item 4, at 24), but for some unexplained \nreason, it was not included by the Trustee as a scheduled creditor, and no payments were \nmade through the Trustee. Applicant contends that since the creditor failed to timely file \na proof of claim, he is no longer responsible for the debt.

The aged account no longer appears in \nhis 2020 credit report. The account has not been resolved. \nAs noted above, when Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator in March \n2019 \u2013 four months after he obtained his current position \u2013 he claimed to be willing and \nable to pay his delinquent accounts. Nevertheless, he offered no evidence that he had \nentered into any repayment arrangements or made any payments to his creditors. His \ncurrent financial status is unreported as he did not submit a Personal Financial Statement \nto indicate his net monthly income; his monthly expenses; or a possible monthly \nremainder available for discretionary spending or savings. He produced no family budget. \nIn the absence of present financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant \nis currently in a better position financially than he had been. \nForeign Influence \nAs noted above, Applicant was born in Venezuela. Both of his parents were born \nin Venezuela. His father is deceased, but his mother, a septuagenarian, remains a citizen-\nresident of Venezuela. She was a stay-at-home wife and mother, and she is now a stay-\nat-home widow. He has one sibling, a sister, who is a quinquagenarian, citizen-resident \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nof Venezuela, and an attorney working in children services.

(Item 3, at 35, 38) \nHe engages with both his mother and his sister on a weekly basis, either by phone, email, \nor text message. He has not travelled to Venezuela since December 2011, and he \nprofesses no interest in doing so \u201canytime soon.\u201d (Response to the FORM, at 2) \nAlthough he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2015, he has taken no formal \naction under Venezuelan law to renounce his Venezuelan citizenship, and thus, he \nremains a dual citizen. (Item 3, at 10) During his OPM interview, Applicant expressed \ninterest in renouncing his Venezuelan citizenship and relinquishing his expired \nVenezuelan passport if asked to do so. (Response to the FORM, at 2) In fact, under U.S. \nlaw, he renounced his allegiance to Venezuela when he took his oath of U.S. citizenship. \nThat oath is as follows: \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure \nall allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States \nof America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true \nfaith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United \nStates when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service \nin the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I \nwill perform work of national importance under civilian direction when \nrequired by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental \nreservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-\nunited-states-america \nVenezuela \nVenezuela is a multiparty, constitutional republic in constant turmoil. While there \nhave been periods of stability and democracy, Venezuelan history has been marred with \ncoup d\u2019 \u00e9tat and authoritarian executive political power. The late Hugo Chavez, a multi-\nterm elected President, eventually ushered in socialism, anti-capitalism, and a radical left-\nwing ideology. The \u201ccurrent\u201d President, Nicolas Maduro, has continued the left-wing \nmarch towards authoritarian rule, and driven the once prosperous nation into economic \nruin. According to the International Monetary Fund, the cumulative decline of the \nVenezuelan economy since 2013 will surpass 60 percent, and is among the deepest five-\nyear contractions the world has seen over the last half century. There is a marked \ndecreased in the supply of food and medicine, access to food, decreased hospital \nservices, and increased infant deaths. \nThe Maduro regime has consistently violated the human rights and dignity of the \ncountry\u2019s citizens, plundered its natural resources, exercised control over the judicial and \nlegislative branches of government, and established a parallel, illegitimate legislative \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nbody alongside the existing elected one. There is widespread and arbitrary repression of \ncivil society and the democratic opposition. In March 2019, diplomatic personnel were \nwithdrawn from the U.S. Embassy, and all U.S. consular services have been suspended. \nThe U.S. Department of State issued a travel advisory for Venezuela declaring that U.S. \ncitizens should not travel to Venezuela due to COVID-19, crime, civil unrest, poor health \ninfrastructure, kidnappings, and arbitrary arrests of U.S. citizens. Caracas has been \ndesignated as being a medium-threat location for both political violence and terrorism \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. government interests. In Venezuela, there were an \nestimated 16,506 murders and a rate of 60.3 violent deaths per 100,000 inhabitants \nduring 2019. The two largest types of homicide were criminal-caused and those caused \nby state security forces by excessive use of force or extrajudicial execution. \nHis regime has provided permissive environments for terrorists, including those \nassociated with dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-D), the \nColombian National Liberation Army (ELN), as well as Hizballah. There is a continued \nprominence of armed pro-government gang-militias known as \u201ccolectivos\u201d that identify as \nsocialist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist. There are extrajudicial killings and torture by \nsecurity forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; and free expression of \nindividual and the media is routinely blocked. The 2018 presidential elections were widely \ncondemned, as they were not considered to be free or fair. Juan Guaido, an opposition \nleader as well as the President of the freely-elected National Assembly, assumed the \nposition as President of Venezuela, and is recognized as such by the United States and \nother countries, but President Maduro, with the backing of a Cuban Security Forces, \nprevented President Guaido from exercising authority. There is pervasive corruption and \nimpunity among security forces and at the highest levels of state and national \ngovernment. \nBefore the United States suspended diplomatic operations in Venezuela, the \nUnited States was Venezuela\u2019s largest trading partner. In March 2020, the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice charged President Maduro and other current and former \nVenezuelan officials with offenses related to narco-terrorism, corruption, and drug \ntrafficking. \nWhile the official U.S. commentary regarding Venezuela focuses on corruption, \nhuman rights violations, and terrorist activities, there is little, if any, evidence that \nVenezuela is an active participant in economic espionage, industrial espionage or trade \nsecret theft, or is a violator of export-control regulations. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately $46,798. \nApplicant obtained his current position in November 2018, and although he contended in \nMarch 2019, that he was willing and able to pay his delinquent debts, he offered no \nevidence to indicate that he tried doing so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. \nBecause of his previous indication of an ability to resolve his debts, and his subsequent \ninaction with respect to satisfying his debts, AG \u00b6 19(b) has also been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) minimally apply, but none of the other mitigating conditions \napply. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing financial issues, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve those \ndelinquent accounts, despite repeated promises to do so, make it rather easy to conclude \nthat they were not infrequent and they are likely to remain unchanged, much like they \nhave been for several years. Applicant has attributed his financial issues essentially to \nhis divorce, custody battle, and periods of unemployment. Those repeated periods of \nunemployment did create financial difficulties, and his divorce and custody battles \nexacerbated those financial difficulties. He is also credited with taking early decisive \naction to resolve his financial problems when he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in \nDecember 2015. He made some favorable strides in making limited payments to the \nTrustee. \nNotwithstanding, once the bankruptcy was dismissed in December 2016, he was \nno longer protected from any collection actions by his creditors. This means that the \nautomatic stay that was in effect during the processing of the bankruptcy is no longer in \nplace, and the creditors are free to pursue their claims against him. This fact seems to \nhave eluded Applicant, for he is still claiming that since his debts were included in his \nbankruptcy, he continues to retain the protections and benefits the bankruptcy afforded \nhim. If he wanted those protections and benefits, he should have either refiled a \nbankruptcy petition under Chapter 13, or converted it to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nFurthermore, as noted above, his comments regarding the status of the unsecured debts \nis contrary to the facts reflected in the Trustee\u2019s FinaI Report which states that only one \nof those debts somehow was not included.

Moreover, since he returned \nto the workforce, initially and temporarily in April 2017, and then permanently in November \n2018, his inactions while employed with respect to his creditors have gone unexplained. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to follow-up on his promises made to the OPM investigator reflect a \ndisregard and disinterest to resolve his delinquent debts. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed his SF 86 in November 2018; underwent his OPM interview in March \n2019; the SOR was issued in August 2020; and the FORM was issued in November 2020. \nEach step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. With respect to his delinquent debts, \nhe offered no verifiable evidence that he took any action to resolve any of those debts. \nBy failing to address his delinquent debts since December 2016, he does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. \nThe Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the \nfuture are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and \notherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. \nBd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)) In this \ninstance, there is no verifiable evidence, either verbally or supported by documentation, \nthat Applicant fulfilled his promises or took any good-faith corrective actions with respect \nto his financial issues, to date. And, after reviewing his Response to the FORM, it is clear \nthat does not expect to do so. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts.

June 4, 2001) \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction since December 2016, and especially following his \nreemployment in 2018, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n6, 2010).) \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n7: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nThe SOR focused on Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s Venezuelan citizenship and \nresidence. Applicant is bound to his family in Venezuela by mutual affection. In addition \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto the citizenship and residence issues, other facts of particular note in the Government\u2019s \nargument in the FORM are generally as follows: the Maduro regime has consistently \nviolated the human rights and dignity of the country\u2019s citizens, plundered its natural \nresources, exercised control over the judicial and legislative branches of government, and \nestablished a parallel, illegitimate legislative body alongside the existing elected one. \nThere is widespread and arbitrary repression of civil society and the democratic \nopposition. There is a permissive environment for terrorists. All of these facts concerning \ncountry conditions in Venezuela demonstrate a potentially heightened risk of exploitation, \ncoercion or duress that are present due to Applicant\u2019s close ties to his two family members \nwho reside in Venezuela.  \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d (See Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)) \nThere are safety issues for residents of Venezuela primarily because of the \npresence of terrorists, pervasive crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, \nkidnappings, and arbitrary arrests. But, the mere possession of close family ties with \nrelatives living in Venezuela is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under the foreign \ninfluence guideline. However, if an applicant has such a relationship with even one person \nliving in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of sensitive information. (See \nISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)) These \ntypes of relationships could create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. Furthermore, as a matter of common sense and \nhuman experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection \nfor, or obligation to, their immediate family members. (See ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2019); ISCR Case No. 09-06831 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2011); ISCR \nCase No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd.

Feb. 20, 2002)) \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for foreign influence cases, \u201cthe nature of \nthe foreign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d (See ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)) Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood \nthat an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government \ncoercion or inducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Venezuela \nwith the United States, and the situation in Venezuela places a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with any family member \nliving in Venezuela does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a \ndesire to assist a relative living in Venezuela. \nForeign influence security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the \nUnited States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) Friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity, and we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United \nStates, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. (See ISCR Case No. \n02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)). But, in this instance, there is little, if any, \nevidence that Venezuela is an active participant in economic espionage, industrial \nespionage or trade secret theft, or is a violator of export-control regulations. It is simply a \nrogue nation that is suppressive of its citizens. \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nVenezuela seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, it would not be wise to rule out such a possibility in the future. \nInternational terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as \ncapable state intelligence services, and Venezuela, like many countries, has a problem \nwith terrorism. But, those terrorists in Venezuela are present to stabilize the authoritarian \nregime, not to engage in economic espionage, industrial espionage or trade secret theft, \nor to violate export-control regulations. Applicant\u2019s family in Venezuela \u201ccould be a means \nthrough which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or \ntechnology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 14-\n02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)) Nevertheless, as noted above, because of the \ncitizenship and residence issues of his family members; and the other facts of particular \nnote in the Government\u2019s argument, the issues of potential foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation have been raised, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. However, further inquiry is \nnecessary to determine the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d as well as the application of any \nmitigating conditions. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n16 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAs noted above, at some point during the Chavez administration, there was a \nsignificant increase in authoritarian rule and the establishment of a socialist agenda. \nPresident Maduro has continued that path. Many daunting challenges remain largely \nbecause of the Cuban Security Forces, terrorists, and other unfriendly forces that \ncontinue to support Maduro and assert power and intimidation within the country. \nHowever, the Venezuelan government is not focusing on economic espionage, industrial \nespionage or trade secret theft. Applicant\u2019s mother and sister are merely potential targets \nin this war on civilized humanity. The presence of radical groups and increased levels of \nterrorism, violence, and insurgency in Venezuela have also been described for events \n(terrorism, civil unrest, and other riots) occurring on September 11, 2001, and more \nrecently in Fort Hood, Boston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, San Bernardino, Portland, Seattle, \nMinneapolis, Kenosha, and New York City. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s mother or sister are or have ever been \npolitical activists, challenging the policies of the Venezuelan government; that Cuban \nSecurity forces or terrorists have approached or threatened them for any reason; that the \nVenezuelan government or any terrorist organization have approached them; or that they \ncurrently engage in activities that would bring attention to themselves. As such, there is \na reduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the \nVenezuelan government or the terrorists, which may seek to quiet those who speak out \nagainst them. Under these circumstances, the potential heightened risk created by their \nresidence in Venezuela is greatly diminished. Under the developed evidence, it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. \nApplicant has substantial connections to the United States, having lived in the \nUnited States for over two decades. His wife and two children are native-born U.S. \ncitizens residing in the United States. \nApplicant has met his burden of showing there is little likelihood that relationships \nwith his mother or sister could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. I am \npersuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and \nthat he has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that he \n17 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) apply.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v.

He received his \nGED diploma in 1991; an associate\u2019s degree in 1995; a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007; and \na master\u2019s degree in 2011. In December 2015, in an effort to address his delinquent debts, \nhe filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. In December 2015, when he claimed to have $121,205 in \nliabilities, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. He paid the Trustee $8,400, \nbut stopped making additional payments, even for scheduled creditors for which claims \nwere allowed, because his period of unemployment left him with insufficient funds to do \nso. The bankruptcy was dismissed on December 1, 2016. Although he subsequently \nregained employment, temporarily in 2017 and permanently in November 2018, he failed \nto readdress any of his delinquent accounts. He offered unverified claims in December \n2020, that he had set up a payment plan to resolve all secured debts. He minimized the \nsignificance of the remaining unsecured debts, and he argued that they were associated \nwith unsecured creditors who failed to file proof of claim during the bankruptcy filing.

For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. He has mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The police held him in jail overnight and released him the \nnext day without charges. He was arrested in June 2005 and charged with driving under \nthe influence (DUI). He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of wet reckless. He attended \nseveral alcohol courses.

He \npleaded guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving, and the other charges were \ndismissed. He was sentenced to jail for one day (presumably with credit for time served \nfor the day he was arrested), a fine, and alcohol counseling. (Tr. at 24-27; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6) \nApplicant was gambling and drinking at a casino in about June 2017. He lost \nabout $500. He saw a slot machine with about $100 credit on it. He waited about 15 \nminutes, but there was no indication that anyone was playing the machine. He cashed \nout the $100. When he visited the casino about two weeks later, he was confronted by \nthe casino\u2019s security personnel. He was eventually charged with theft. He paid the $100 \nback, hired a lawyer, pleaded not guilty, and was prepared to fight the charge with the \ndefense that the property had been abandoned, but the judge dismissed the charge \nwithout a trial. (Tr. at 18-22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7) \nApplicant admitted that he drank and gambled too much for a period. He stated \nthat he significantly cut back on his drinking after he quit the moving industry and \nstarted working more stable jobs in about 2015, with his current job starting in August \n2017. His coworkers are more professional than his previous associates. He has not \nbeen arrested or charged with anything since the 2017 theft charge. (Tr. at 13-14-17, \n27-28, 41, 44-45; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s gambling adversely affected his finances. He used his credit and \nattempted to win enough to help him with his finances, but the exact opposite occurred \nas his losses exacerbated the problem. He estimated that he lost $2,500 from about \nMarch 2017 to June 2017. (Tr. at 30-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant reported his criminal issues on his August 2017 Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial questions, he wrote: \u201cI am \ntrying to pay off my credit card and personal loan.

(GE 1, 3) \nA credit report from January 2019 listed that the balance of Applicant\u2019s defaulted \nstudent loan had been reduced to $14,139. Both credit union accounts were reported as \npast due: the credit card account was $1,499 past due with a $15,275 balance; and the \nloan was $923 past due with a $6,916 balance. (GE 4) \nThe SOR alleges the two delinquent credit union accounts. A credit report from \nOctober 2020 listed both accounts as charged off, with balances of $15,270 and $7,004. \nThat credit report listed Applicant\u2019s student loan as current with a balance of $9,900. \n(GE 5) \nApplicant stated that he concentrated on paying his student loans, and that he \npaid more than $10,000 towards them since 2017. The credit reports corroborate that \nassertion. He has not made any recent payments toward the credit union accounts. He \nstated that he planned to contact the credit union in an attempt to resolve the debts, \neither through settlement or a payment plan. He has not received financial counseling. \nHe rarely goes to the casino, and if he does, he does not take more money than he can \nafford to lose. (Tr. at 14, 30-43; GE 3-5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts; and \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused \nby gambling. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including two delinquent credit \nunion accounts. His gambling, funded by his credit, adversely affected his finances. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nApplicant\u2019s gambling appears to be under control, and concerns about his \ngambling are mitigated. He is commended for paying his student loan, but it was at the \nexpense of his credit union accounts. He has not made any recent payments toward \nthose debts. He stated that he planned to contact the credit union in an attempt to \nresolve the debts, either through settlement or a payment plan. However, intentions to \nresolve debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or \nother responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nApplicant has multiple alcohol-related offenses, including being drunk in public, \nDUI, and theft while he was drinking. AG \u00b6 22(a) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \nApplicant asserted that he significantly cut back on his drinking after he quit the \nmoving industry in about 2015. He has not had an alcohol-related driving offense since \n2009. The incident in the casino is an outlier, and that was almost four years ago. I find \nthat additional alcohol-related incidents are unlikely to recur. His alcohol consumption \ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) is applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s  \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe alcohol-related criminal conduct under Guideline G and the gambling issues \nunder Guideline F are cross-alleged under Guideline E. That conduct reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It \nalso created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe discussion above under Guidelines F and G applies equally here. I find that \nthe alcohol-related criminal conduct under Guideline G and the gambling issues under \nGuideline F are unlikely to recur; the conduct does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment; and it no longer serves as a basis for \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are applicable \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, F, and G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable employment record at his current job. However, that is insufficient \nto overcome his failure to address his delinquent debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns, but he did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On January 5, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 11. Applicant received the FORM on January14, 2021. He was afforded 30 days \nafter receiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR and the answer (Items 1 \nand 2) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 11 are admitted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 12, 2021. \nFindings of Fact     \nApplicant admitted his delinquent taxes, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f, and he denied his \nconsumer debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. through 1.i.

After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 64 years old, divorced but remarried with no children. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor overseas since \nMarch 2016. Items 2, 3, and 4. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and the Government\u2019s exhibits establish that \nhe is delinquent on his federal income taxes in the amount of just over $300,000. This \ncovers the years 2005 through 2009 and 2014. Applicant is making $600 payments per \npay period to the IRS. Applicant did not disclose his tax delinquencies on his December \n22, 2015, e-QIP. He disclosed them during his May 9, 2019, personal subject interview \n(PSI). Items 2, and 4 through 10. The record shows that federal tax liens were filed against \nApplicant in 2011 and 2017. Items 8 through 10. \nApplicant was audited for 2001 through 2005 and was found to owe $15,000 in \nincome taxes. Applicant claims that because he deployed overseas he appointed his \nbrother-in-law to handle his tax matters but that his brother-in-law failed to do so. \nApplicant has since retained a tax-relief advocate and a tax lawyer to clear up his tax \nproblems. Applicant said that his tax issues should be resolved by March 27, 2020. He \ndid not, however, provide any new or additional information. Item 2. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(f) failure to file\u2026annual Federal income tax returns\u2026or failure to pay \nannual Federal \u2026 income tax as required. \nThe SOR tax delinquencies are established by the Items 2 through 10, and the \nconsumer debts are established by the credit report in the record. Item 11. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(f) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has provided plausible explanations for the consumer debts. \nMedical debts are often incurred under circumstances largely beyond an \napplicant\u2019s control. In addition, the magnitude of Applicant\u2019s consumer debts does not, \nin itself, raise security concerns. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g.through 1.i. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay his federal income taxes presents a more troublesome \nissue. Those failures extend as far back as 2005, if not earlier.

Paying federal income taxes is a serious obligation. \nApplicant should at least have exercised at some minimal oversight of his brother-in-law. \nApparently, Applicant did not do so. That calls into question Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability to have access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 4 (App. Bd. \nJun. 27, 2000). I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have also considered the whole-person concept. \nApplicant leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.f  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and cross-alleges under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 2.e) that Applicant submitted false time records to his then employer from about September 2015 through January 2016, claiming 1,035 in work hours that he had not performed for which he was paid $21,735.

He admitted the arrests for assault and battery but stated that the 2007 incident was \u201ca complicated situation of false identification\u201d and the 2004 charge was nothing more than a verbal altercation with his mother and stepfather.

Following a \nsuccessful test of the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) platform on March 17, 2021, \nApplicant expressed his preference for a hearing date of April 7, 2021, even though he \nwas provided alternative dates that would have given him 15 days advance notice of the \nhearing. On March 26, 2021, DOHA issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s DCS video \nteleconference hearing for April 7, 2021. \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted without \nobjection. GE 3 consisted of documentation Applicant had provided to DOHA on \nNovember 12, 2020. Applicant submitted no exhibits, but he testified, as reflected in a \nhearing transcript (Tr.) received on April 16, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and cross-alleges under \nGuideline J (SOR \u00b6 2.e) that Applicant submitted false time records to his then employer \nfrom about September 2015 through January 2016, claiming 1,035 in work hours that he \nhad not performed for which he was paid $21,735. Additionally, under Guideline J \nApplicant allegedly was arrested in December 2004 for assault and battery (SOR \u00b6 2.a); \nin June 2007 for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (SOR \u00b6 2.b); in July 2010 \non an outstanding bench warrant (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and in July 2013 for OUI (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted that he had made \n\u201ca dishonest and terrible decision\u201d by knowingly charging work hours after he had \nreturned to college, and that he had committed the OUI offense in 2013, but asserted that \nhe had learned from his past mistakes. Applicant denied any knowledge of a bench \nwarrant, and indicated that a criminal records check showed no arrest from 2010. He \nadmitted the arrests for assault and battery but stated that the 2007 incident was \u201ca \ncomplicated situation of false identification\u201d and the 2004 charge was nothing more than \na verbal altercation with his mother and stepfather. He requested that he be given a \nchance to show he can be trusted handling classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old engineer. He has never married and has no children. A \nnative of Nigeria, he moved to the United States in 2003 and became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen on his own application in February 2016. He earned an associate\u2019s degree from a \ncommunity college in May 2011, and began studies for a bachelor\u2019s degree in September \n2011. He eventually earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2018. He has worked for his \ndefense-contractor employer since October 2018. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32.) \nOn December 27, 2004, Applicant had an altercation with his stepfather and \nmother because he refused to shovel snow. Applicant states that he had an interview for \na part-time job and did not want to be late, but his stepfather and mother did not believe \nhim. He denies that he hit either his mother or stepfather, but admits that \u201cthere was some \nyelling\u201d (Tr. 26, 51); that the situation escalated; and that he had not let his mother or \nstepfather know that he had an interview scheduled. (Tr. 52-53.) His stepfather called the \npolice, and he was arrested for assault and battery. (GE 5.) Applicant testified that he did \nnot recall the disposition of the charge, although he then added that he had to meet with \nsomeone in the juvenile court system and was on probation \u201cfor a couple of months or so \nor maybe a year.\u201d (Tr. 50-51.) No police or court records were submitted in evidence \nshowing the circumstances that led to his arrest or the disposition of the charge. \nApplicant was arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon on June \n9, 2007. (GE 5.) No police or court records were submitted in evidence showing the \ncircumstances that led to his arrest or the disposition of the charge. Applicant testified \nthat it was a case of racial targeting, and he was misidentified as the perpetrator. (Tr. 27, \n54-55.) He came upon the scene after an apparent assault, and the charge against him \nwas dropped. (Tr. 28-29.) \nAfter high school, Applicant matriculated in a private college so that he could play \nsoccer at the collegiate level. His mother complained about the expense (Tr. 68-69), so \nhe took a year off before studying for his associate\u2019s degree at a community college from \nSeptember 2008 to May 2011. (GE 1.) \nA check of criminal records by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shows \nthat Applicant was arrested on July 20, 2010, on a bench warrant. (GE 5.) Applicant \ndenies any recollection of the warrant or the arrest and ever knowingly failing to appear \nin court on any charge. (Tr. 29-30, 58.) While Applicant apparently failed to timely register \nhis vehicle in 2008 (Answer; Tr. 59), there is no evidence linking his late registration to \nthe warrant. No police or court records were submitted in evidence showing the \ncircumstances that led to the arrest or the disposition of the charge. \nApplicant matriculated in his state\u2019s university on its main campus in September \n2011. Through May 2013, he worked part time on campus in its financial aid office. At the \nend of the spring semester in 2013, he had an internship in system design with a \ntelecommunications company.

He had \nconsumed one can of \u201cFour Loko\u201d while socializing at a friend\u2019s house. (Tr. 44-45.) \nAccording to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, \u201cFour Loko\u201d is a \nfruity-flavored beverage that comes in 23.5 ounce cans and is about 12% alcohol. Each \ncan contains the equivalent of nearly five standard alcoholic drinks. See \nhttp://www.spectrum.niaaa.nih.gov. He had planned to stay at his friend\u2019s home, but \ncircumstances changed. He failed a field sobriety test, and a couple of Adderall pills, \nwhich Applicant submits belonged to a friend who had a prescription, were found in his \nvehicle. (Tr. 22.) Applicant was charged with possession of a class B drug, possession of \na class E drug, OUI, negligent operation of a motor vehicle to endanger, speeding, and \nmarked lanes violation. (GEs 4-5; Tr. 22.) Pursuant to a plea agreement, on April 2, 2014, \nthe OUI charge was continued without a finding for ten months, and the other charges \nwere dismissed. Applicant was placed on OUI supervision to February 2015 and ordered \nto pay costs, perform 82 hours of community service, and remain drug and alcohol free \nwith random drug testing. He lost his driving privileges for 45 days. (GE 4.) Applicant was \nrequired to attend some Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Mother\u2019s Against Drunk Driving \n(MADD) meetings to regain his driving privileges, and the university required that he \nreceive some counseling. (Tr. 45-46.) He testified that he was deemed an alcoholic by \nthe court (Tr. 48), but there is no evidence substantiating such a diagnosis. He submits \nthat he paid the consequences for his poor judgment to drive a vehicle while intoxicated \nand that he \u201clearned a lot of lessons that [he holds] to this day.\u201d (Tr. 49.) He now rarely \ndrinks alcohol. (Id.) \nIn August 2014, Applicant\u2019s internship with the telecommunications company \nended. He was kept on the project as a temporary contract data engineer under the \nemployment of a consulting company that paid him $21 per hour. At the end of each \nweek, Applicant submitted a report to the consulting company showing the number of \nhours he worked on the project that week, and the consulting company paid him directly. \nThe consulting company then invoiced the telecommunications company for the hours \nworked by Applicant. Before any payment by the telecommunications company, the hours \nworked by Applicant had to be approved by a manager at the telecommunications \ncompany. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 32-34.) \nAt the end of the semester in December 2014, Applicant was on academic \nprobation and not allowed to continue in his engineering program. (Tr. 23, 47-48.) He was \nadvised to choose another major course of study, but he was passionate about \nengineering. (Tr. 23.) He withdrew from the university and enrolled in a community college \nto improve his grades so that he could pursue an engineering degree at another university \nwithin the state\u2019s system of higher education. (Tr. 68.) He continued to work as a \ncontractor for the telecommunications company. (GE 1.) \nIn September 2015, Applicant transferred to another campus within his state\u2019s \nuniversity system. On September 30, 2015, the telecommunications company ceased \napproving hours for Applicant, and he stopped working on the project. He was able to \nobtain one loan that did not fully cover his tuition and was not eligible for any additional \nsubsidized or unsubsidized federal student loans. (Tr. 38, 69.)

Applicant represented to the consulting company \nthat the telecommunications company had approved his hours. Based on those reports, \nthe consulting company paid him $21,735 for a total of 1,035 hours that he did not work. \n(GEs 1-3; Tr. 19-20, 34-35.) Applicant used the unearned income to pay for his education \nand living expenses. (Tr. 38-39.) Applicant realized \u201cafter a month or halfway through\u201d \nthat it was not a good idea to submit false time records, but he continued to persist in his \nfraudulent activity. (Tr. 64-65.) He understood that it was \u201ca dishonest and disloyal act,\u201d \nbut he needed to pay for college. He had a payment deadline to the university or he would \nbe dropped from classes. (Tr. 19-20, 65-66.) His submission of false time records ceased \nwhen it was discovered. (Tr. 64-66.) \nApplicant began working as a residential assistant at the university around March \n1, 2016. He was transparent about his OUI and used his experience to instruct students \nabout the consequences of drunk driving. (Tr. 24-25.) There is no evidence that he was \ncandid with his university employer about his falsification of time records.  \nOn March 26, 2016, attorneys for the consulting company informed Applicant that \nthe company had recently learned of his falsification of work records from October 1, 2015 \nthrough January 22, 2016, and that he was being terminated from his employment for his \ndeceit. Through its legal counsel, the company demanded that he remit $21,735 by April \n2016 or contact them before close of business on March 30, 2016, to discuss mutually \nagreeable terms of repayment. (GE 2.) When confronted about his fraudulent activity, \nApplicant had less than $1,000 remaining of the income he did not earn. (Tr. 39.) \nFacing a civil lawsuit by the company (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 37, 41) and fearing that he \nwould be jailed (Tr. 40), Applicant entered into a confidential settlement agreement in \nAugust 2016 under which he was required to sign an agreement for judgment for $21,735 \nto be executed if he defaulted on his repayment terms. (GE 3.) The consulting company \nwas \u201ckind enough\u201d to postpone his repayment until he graduated from college. (Tr. 20, \n70.) Under the settlement, Applicant agreed to repay $21,735 at $250 per month from \nOctober 2018 through December 2018; $300 per month from January 2019 through \nMarch 2019; $350 per month from April 2019 through June 2019; and $500 per month \nfrom July 2019 through July 2022 with a final payment of $535 due on August 1, 2022.  \nApplicant provided documentation of his timely payments through November 2020 \nshowing that he had paid $10,535 with $11,200 left to pay under the settlement \nagreement. (GE 3.) He testified credibly that he continued to make his monthly payments \nthrough April 2021. (Tr. 43, 70.) Applicant did not challenge the $21,735 to be repaid \nbecause he knew he \u201cwas in the wrong.\u201d (Tr. 36-37.) \nApplicant\u2019s campus jobs as a residential assistant and as an information \ntechnology technician ended when he received his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2018.

He \nindicated that he left his employment with the consulting company in January 2016 \u201cby \nmutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct.\u201d In response to police \nrecord inquiries, he listed the charges filed against him in July 2013. About the drug \ncharges, he explained that Adderall had been found in his vehicle; that the drug belonged \nto a friend who had a prescription and the charges were \u201cremoved\u201d when the friend \u201cgave \na sworn statement.\u201d He stated with respect to the OUI, \u201cI am very apologetic and I \nregretted my actions and I am thankful that there was no accident and nobody got hurt.\u201d \n(GE 1.) \nOn October 1, 2018, Applicant started working for his employer, who is currently \nsponsoring him for security clearance eligibility. He was not required to submit a new SF \n86. (Tr. 32.) Applicant presently earns $74,000 annually at his defense-contractor \nemployment. (Tr. 67.) He has never held a security clearance and works on unclassified \nprojects. (Tr. 60.) \nAs of November 2020, Applicant had one revolving charge account with an \noutstanding balance. The account was current with a balance of $196. His installment \nloan debt of $101,094 was for student loans. (Answer; GE 3.) He had $10,031 in a savings \naccount. (GE 3; Tr. 71.) \nApplicant acknowledges that \u201c[he] made one too many bad decisions,\u201d and submits \nthat he has endeavored to be a law-abiding citizen since his falsification of time records \nfrom October 1, 2015 through January 22, 2016. (Tr. 21.) He is remorseful for his deceitful \nconduct and realizes that being financially pressed to pay for college does not justify his \nmisconduct. (Tr. 65.) He plans on pursuing a master\u2019s degree in the near future. (Tr. 22.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nApplicant admits that, while employed as a temporary contract worker on a project \nfor a telecommunications company, he falsely claimed work hours that he did not perform \nfrom October 1, 2015 through January 22, 2016. At the time his deception was \ndiscovered, he did not challenge his then employer\u2019s assertion that he was paid $21,735 \nfor 1,035 in work hours fraudulently claimed. His exercise of extremely poor judgment \nwas repeated on a weekly basis for 16 weeks.

This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time \nor resources. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated submission of knowingly false time records was clearly \nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior under AG \u00b6 16(d)(1), inappropriate behavior under \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(2), a pattern of dishonesty under AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), and evidence of significant \nmisuse of his employer\u2019s resources under AG \u00b6 16(d)(4). That being said, it was also \nconduct alleged under Guideline J, albeit without a proffer from the Government about \nwhat law Applicant violated, and, in light of its seriousness and recidivism, conduct that \nis sufficient by itself for an adverse determination under the personal conduct guideline. \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) could have some applicability. They provide: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s theft of $21,735 from his employer by falsifying weekly time reports for \nsome 16 weeks is too serious for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c), despite the passage of five \nyears since his last fraudulent submission. His status as a student with tuition bills is not \nan unusual circumstance that could possibly justify his recidivist behavior. Neither his age \nin terms of the years it was taking for him to earn his bachelor\u2019s degree nor his apparent \nexhaustion of his federal student loan eligibility can reasonably excuse his repeated \nmalfeasance. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) has some applicability in that Applicant acknowledges his wrongdoing \nand realizes it was not justified. He has taken some positive steps to alleviate the financial \nissues that led to his untrustworthy behavior. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree, has full-\ntime employment at an income of $74,000 annually with a defense contractor, manages \nhis consumer credit responsibly, and has accumulated more than $10,000 in savings. \nThe salient issue under AG \u00b6 17(d) is whether those steps are sufficient to reasonably \nconclude that the behavior is unlikely to recur. His evidence in that regard falls somewhat \nshort. The evidence shows that Applicant had some misgivings about his fraudulent \nactivity but persisted in the behavior until he was caught. Had his falsification of time \nrecords not been discovered by his employer, it is likely that it would have continued \nbeyond January 22, 2016. Moreover, while Applicant has expressed remorse, and has \nbeen timely in his restitution payments, the unpaid restitution stands at $8,700, assuming \ntimely payments at $500 a month for December 2020 through April 2021. It is difficult to \nfind that he is fully rehabilitated when he remains under the threat of a court judgment \nshould he default on any payments. Applicant benefitted from the good will of his former \nemployer, who could have filed criminal charges against him but instead allowed him to \nearn his bachelor\u2019s degree before requiring him to start repayment. While Applicant is not \nrequired to accelerate his repayment of the restitution, he would have had a stronger case \nin mitigation if the consequences of his serious misconduct were fully behind him. The \npersonal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant does not have any criminal convictions on his record, he admits \nculpability with respect to the OUI alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d and the falsification of his time \nrecords leading to the theft of $21,735 from his now former employer (SOR \u00b6 2.e). The \nGovernment did not cite the law Applicant violated by submitting fraudulent work records \nand accepting $21,735 in pay to which he was not entitled. Chapter 266, Section 30 of \nthe pertinent state\u2019s statutes provides in part: \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhoever steals, or with intent to defraud obtains by a false pretense, or \nwhoever unlawfully, and with intent to steal or embezzle, converts, or \nsecrets with intent to convert the property of another as defined in this \nsection, whether such property is or is not in his possession at the time of \nsuch conversion or secreting, shall be guilty of larceny, . . . or, if the value \nof the property stolen exceeds $1,200, be punished by imprisonment in the \nstate prison for not more than five years, or by a fine of not more than \ntwenty-five thousand dollars and imprisonment in jail for not more than two \nyears. . . . \nAG \u00b6 31(b) is established. It provides: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \nApplicant does not dispute his arrests for assault and battery in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nand 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), which are a matter of public record. (GE 5.) He admits that there \nwas some yelling involved in the 2004 incident but denies striking either his mother or \nstepfather. He admits to having served some type of probation in the juvenile system, but \neven so, given his age at the time and his undisputed account of the circumstances, it is \nof little security concern with respect to his current judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. His arrest, without more, is not enough to establish culpability with \nrespect to the alleged assault in 2007 or of a violation that led to his arrest on an \noutstanding warrant in 2010. The AGs provide for mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(c) when there \nis \u201cno reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense.\u201d \nApplication of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(b) because of the OUI and repeated \nsubmission of falsified time cards warrants consideration of the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following two conditions could apply in whole or in part: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including  but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s drunk driving is not condoned, but it appears to have been an isolated \nincident that occurred more than seven years ago, when he was drinking \u201cFour Loko,\u201d an \ninexpensive but potent malt beverage enjoyed by college students wanting a cheap way \nto get drunk. Applicant regrets the incident and realizes that he was fortunate in that no \none was injured. He completed the court-ordered terms of his probation and additional \ncounseling required of him by the university. He used the incident as a teaching moment \nwhen he was a student residential advisor. He also exhibited reform by moderating his \nalcohol consumption to where he now drinks rarely. His present circumstances are no \nlonger conducive to abusing alcohol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply in mitigation of his OUI, \nan offense which, unlike his falsification of time records, lacked moral turpitude. For the \nreasons discussed under Guideline E, supra, neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) nor 32(d) are fully \nsatisfied with respect to mitigation of the recidivist submission of falsified time records to \nknowingly obtain unearned income. That felonious conduct continues to cast doubt about \nhis judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d), which are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guidelines E and \nJ, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant was a 26-year-old college student \nwhen he falsified his time records. He is now 32 years old and in a job that he enjoys with \na defense contractor. He submits that he is no longer the person that he was when he \nbetrayed the trust of his then employer. He has been reliable in repaying his restitution \nunder the terms of a confidential settlement. \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for specific past \nconduct. The security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, \nand other characteristics essential to protecting national security information. When there \nis an issue of significant security concern, there is a strong presumption against the grant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nor renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). The Government must be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance \neligibility to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and \nwithout regard to their personal interests. Applicant\u2019s submission of falsified time records \nwas not an isolated instance of extremely poor judgment borne out of desperation. Each \nsubmission of a falsified time record constituted a separate offense, raising serious \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Perhaps at some future date, \nApplicant may be able to demonstrate persuasively that he deserves the opportunity to \nprove his trustworthiness. However, for the reasons discussed above, I am unable to find \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security \nclearance eligibility at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

(TR at page 38 line 22 to page 39 line 1, \nand AppX I.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \nApplicant had past due tax filings and taxes due, and other past-due debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s past financial difficulties were caused by conditions clearly beyond his \ncontrol: being laid off, the cut-off of disability payments, and homelessness. He has \nsince filed and paid his taxes, and addressed all of his alleged past-due debts. He has \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nbeen established. Financial Considerations are found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.i.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(GE 5, at 4-5) \nIn May 2018, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he acknowledged that there\nwas a state tax issue in the estimated amount of $200 that he planned to resolve when \nfiling his next year\u2019s taxes. He added that when he viewed his credit report, he noticed \n\u201csome errors\u201d and in November 2017, and also in January 2018, he disputed the accounts \nthat he claimed were errors, using slight variations of the following comments: \n \nI sent a letter to (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion).

With the \nexception of his unpaid state tax and delinquent child support, he disputed all of the debts \ndiscussed, even though he was aware in some instances what the account was for. \nAlthough Applicant was accorded the opportunity to provide documentation to support his \nexplanations regarding the financial delinquencies discussed during the interview, he \nfailed to do so. \nApplicant contended that in November 2017, he engaged the professional services \nof an organization that provides access to credit histories, consumer reports, and credit \nmonitoring. His purpose was to obtain help in disputing his credit report. As of January \n2019, he was still using the organization\u2019s services. (GE 5, at 8-9) He was unable to \nfurnish documentation to support his contention that he actually had that professional \nrelationship. (AE O) As of January 2019, Applicant had not received any credit counseling \nor debt consolidation services. (GE 5, at 10) \nIn addition to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the SOR, as amended, alleged 11 \ndelinquent accounts that were placed for collection, totaling approximately $118,977, as \nset forth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a child support arrearage in the amount of $19,201 associated \nwith Applicant\u2019s son. (GE 2, at 2; GE 6, at 3; GE 3, at 5; GE 5, at 10) Applicant and his \nwife \u2013 the mother of their child \u2013 were divorced in May 2017. (AE C) At some point, the \ncourt ordered him to pay monthly child support of $1,157, but Applicant refused to make \nany payments while disputing paternity and awaiting the results of a paternity test. (GE 1, \nat 53) As of September 23, 2020, Applicant was required to maintain the monthly child \nsupport payment, while adding a monthly $100 arrears payment, for a total monthly \npayment of $1,257. Periodic insufficient payments were garnished from his bank account. \n(Tr. at 36-37) The unpaid arrears balance as of September 23, 2020, had increased to \napproximately $24,085, and when approximately $3,971 in interest was added, the total \namount owed increased to approximately $29,213. (AE J, at 1) \nDuring the period August 2019 through July 2020, there was only one payment \nthat came anywhere close to the court-ordered amount, and that occurred in May 2020, \nwhen the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intercepted a $1,200 tax refund and applied it \nto the child support arrearage. (AE J, at 2-4) Applicant offered no documentation that \nreflected any child support payments made more recently than $100 in July 2020. (AE J, \nat 4) In November 2020, Applicant filed for joint custody and visitation on all three-day \nweekends, breaks and holidays. (AE I) During the hearing, he admitted to only paying the \nmonthly $100 arrearage (AE A), but justified his limited payments by claiming that he is \ncurrently fighting \u201cit\u201d and did not know if his son is even alive. (Tr. at 77; AE O) The account \nhas not been properly addressed by Applicant, and there is little evidence that he intends \nto do so. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. refers to unpaid state taxes for the tax year 2016 in the amount of $200 \nthat Applicant claimed he was unaware of until he received a notification in the mail in \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 2018. He told the OPM investigator that he intended to resolve the issue when \nhe filed his 2018 state tax return in April 2019. (GE 5, at 8) When he submitted his Answer \nto the SOR in April 2020, he admitted that as of the date of the SOR (April 8, 2020) he \nhad not resolved the debt, but also claimed that he was not 100 percent sure, so he \nintended to take care of the matter in 2020. (Answer to SOR, at 2) During the hearing, he \nadmitted that he was not sure if the debt had been resolved by being withdrawn from his \nfederal income tax refund. (Tr. at 40) In the absence of more definitive evidence regarding \na payment to the creditor, the account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.j. refer to loans for automobiles, trucks, or motor \ncycles, with unpaid balances of $18,811 (a truck); $27,673 (a pickup truck); $14,450 (an \nautomobile); $14,738 (a motorcycle); and $17,908 (a BMW automobile), that were placed \nfor collection.

(GE 4, 21-22) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.e., 1.h., and 1.i., refer to a variety of accounts, some of which were \ncharge accounts, unspecified types of accounts, or credit-card accounts with unpaid \nbalances of $48 (unspecified); $3,658 (wife\u2019s credit card); $315 (unspecified); and $1,975 \n(charge account), that were placed for collection.

(GE 4, 21-22) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. refers to the Voluntary Petition of Bankruptcy under Chapter 7 that \nApplicant filed on March 12, 2019, and the ensuing discharge of his liabilities on June 17, \n2019. In his Petition, he estimated between 1 and 49 creditors; and between $50,000 and \n$100,000 in liabilities. He identified only creditors who had unsecured claims totaling \n$56,613. (GE 4) \nAside from disputing 18 accounts that were listed in his credit reports as \ndelinquent, including his child support obligations, Applicant did not get in touch with any \nof those creditors because he contends that he would not have had the money to resolve \nhis debts. (Tr. at 85) \nEffective December 1, 2017, Applicant started receiving 90 percent monthly \nservice-connected disability compensation of approximately $2,042. (GE 4, at 51) When \nhe filed his bankruptcy petition on March 12, 2019, he reported zero monthly income. (GE \n4, at 39-40) At some point between May 28, 2018, and December 1, 2019, his monthly \nservice-connected disability compensation was increased to 100 percent or \napproximately $3,777. (AE N) In addition to his service-connected disability \ncompensation, during calendar year 2019, he received $12,522 in wages. (AE L) On \nOctober 19, 2020, he and his girlfriend purchased a new automobile which cost over \n$52,000, minus a trade-in. He paid the dealer $6,000 in cash, and the remaining unpaid \nbalance was nearly $49,000. His current monthly payment is nearly $875. (GE 6, at 2-3; \nAE A; AE D).

(GE 4, at 52) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nIn addition to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the SOR, as amended, alleged 11 \ndelinquent accounts that were placed for collection, totaling approximately $118,977. \nIncluded in that amount were Applicant\u2019s failure to pay $200 in state taxes for the tax year \n2016; his failure to pay child support totaling (at the time the SOR was issued) $19,201 \u2013 \nan amount that has since increased to $26,540 in January 2021; and nine other \ndelinquent debts that he recognized, but nevertheless disputed without a legitimate basis. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations pertaining to all of his delinquent debts are always inconsistent \nand sometimes confusing. While claiming insufficient funds to pay his creditors, as well \nas objections to being required to pay child support, he purchased an expensive new \nvehicle. He failed to submit any documentary evidence to show that he had resolved, or \nattempted to resolve, other than by Chapter 7 bankruptcy, any of the delinquent accounts \nalleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) minimally apply, but none of the other conditions apply. \nApplicant conceded that his child support arrearage had not been resolved, in part \nbecause he had initially delayed making any payments because he was not sure if he \nwas actually the parent of the child; subsequently because he was not permitted to \nexercise visitation rights; and eventually because he was not sure if the child was alive. \nAs for the delinquent state tax from the tax year 2016, he had intended to resolve the \nissue when he filed his 2018 state tax return in April 2019, but when he submitted his \nAnswer to the SOR in April 2020, he admitted that as of the date of the SOR (April 8, \n2020) he had not resolved the debt.

As for the remaining delinquent debts, he simply disputed them without \nfurnishing a reasonable basis to do so, even though he recognized those debts. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing financial difficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his \ndelinquent accounts, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is \nlikely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. The child support \narrearage and the unpaid tax remain unresolved. Only the delinquent commercial \naccounts, including credit-card accounts, charge accounts, and loan accounts were \naddressed by the bankruptcy. \nDepartment Counsel has argued that because Applicant failed to specifically list \nall of his delinquent accounts in the bankruptcy filing, several of the accounts were not \ndischarged. That argument is not persuasive. \nIn a bankruptcy filing, most debtors list potential creditors, even when the debt may \nhave been resold or transferred to a different collection agent or creditor, to ensure notice, \nand reduce the risk of subsequent dismissal of the bankruptcy. If Applicant failed to list \nsome debts on his bankruptcy schedule, this failure to list some debts does not affect \ntheir discharge. Absent fraud, in a no-asset bankruptcy, all unsecured, nonpriority debts \nare discharged when the bankruptcy court grants a discharge, even when they are not \nlisted on a bankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); \nFrancis v. Nat\u2019l Revenue Service, Inc., 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010), but see First \nCircuit Bucks Majority on Discharge of Unlisted Debt in No-Asset Case, American \nBankruptcy Institute, 28-9 ABIJ 58 (Nov. 2009). There is no requirement to re-open the \nbankruptcy to discharge the debt. Collier on Bankruptcy, Matthew Bender & Company, \nInc., 2010, Chapter 4-523, \u00b6 523(a)(3)(A).

Priority debts, such as tax debts, student loan debts, and child support \nobligations, are generally not discharged through bankruptcy. Secured debts such as \nhome mortgages and car liens are not discharged unless the security (home or car) is \nforeclosed or repossessed. \nWhile Applicant attributed his financial problems to several factors: periods of \nunemployment, a divorce, and insufficient funds, it appears that he was receiving funds \n(service-connected disability compensation and/or a salary) for several years. He \ncontends that he had insufficient funds to even contact his creditors, but it is clear that he \nhad sufficient funds to purchase a new automobile which cost over $52,000, minus a \ntrade-in. He paid the dealer $6,000 in cash. Before accepting his new job with an annual \nsalary of $31,604, he reported a monthly remainder of approximately $1,404 available for \ndiscretionary spending or savings. Nevertheless, rather than attempting to reduce the \nchild support arrearage, he continues to sometimes pay $100 a month. His failure to make \nany attempts to resolve any of his delinquent accounts, including one for only $48, other \nthan by disputing them or obtaining a bankruptcy discharge for most of them, is indicative \nof his disinterest in resolving them.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to ignore his \ndelinquent accounts even after he was interviewed by OPM. An applicant who begins to \nresolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her \nsecurity clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her \nown interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR \nCase No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant completed his SF 86 in \nMay 2018; underwent his OPM interview in January 2019; and he filed his Voluntary \nPetition for Bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in March 2019. The initial SOR was issued in \nApril 2020. Each step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of \nthe significance of the financial issues confronting him.

They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. \nOther than the online financial counseling associated with the bankruptcy, there is \nno other evidence of financial counseling or a budget. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, \nunder the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \ntest administrator with his current employer since March 2021. He previously served in \nsecurity positions for an employer in Kuwait, and in automobile sales for other employers. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA 2005 high school graduate, he received an associate\u2019s degree in 2020. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps in July 2005, and he served on active duty until February 2015, \nwhen he was honorably discharged as a sergeant (E-5).  He was initially granted a secret \nclearance in 2005. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was \nsuspended by the U.S. Department of State from March 2015 until March 2018 based on \nhis failure to report previous financial issues and disciplinary non-judicial punishment \nwhile on active duty. Those issues were based on his failure to disclose financial \ndifficulties that he had at the time, as well as his actions involving insurance fraud. \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)) See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged conduct \nassociated with his previous lack of candor will be considered only for the five purposes \nlisted above \u2013 with emphasis on (a), (b), and (e). \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged 11 delinquent accounts that were placed for \ncollection, totaling approximately $118,977. Included in that amount were Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to pay $200 in state taxes for the tax year 2016; his failure to pay child support \ntotaling (at the time the SOR was issued) $19,201 \u2013 an amount that has since increased \nto $26,540 in January 2021; and nine other delinquent debts that he recognized, but \nnevertheless disputed without a legitimate basis. In May 2018, when Applicant completed \nhis SF 86, he acknowledged that there was a state tax issue in the estimated amount of \n$200 that he planned to resolve when filing his next year\u2019s tax return. He added that when \nhe viewed his credit report, he noticed \u201csome errors\u201d and in November 2017, and also in \nJanuary 2018, he disputed all of the accounts with the exception of his unpaid state tax \nand delinquent child support, and requested that they be removed from his credit report. \nIn January 2019, during an OPM interview, he claimed to be unaware of the numerous \ndelinquent debts in his name. \nApplicant claimed insufficient funds to pay his creditors, and he objected to being \nrequired to pay child support. Nevertheless, he purchased an expensive new vehicle. He \nacknowledged making no effort to resolve the accounts that he had previously disputed, \nexplaining that he did not have sufficient funds to do so. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record is extremely poor at best. While he may have been \nsuccessful in eventually having many of his delinquent accounts discharged in \nbankruptcy, his non-existent efforts to resolve those accounts, and his refusal to focus of \nhis child support arrearage, over a lengthy period lead me to conclude that he never had \nany intention to do so. Instead, his actions supported delay, dispute, and discharge of his \nfinancial obligations. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9) \n. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l. \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

I marked the exhibits and his email as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I. \nAll of his exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. The record closed on \nJune 18, 2021. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2021. (Tr. at 17-\n19.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his e-QIP unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his testimony, and the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He was adopted at the age of four and grew up in poverty. \nHe has married and divorced twice (2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2013). He remarried for a \nthird time in 2013 and has one child, age 11, with his current wife. He has four other \nchildren, ages 19 to 27, from prior marriages and other relationships. Applicant works as \na training coordinator instructing hospital personnel on the use of new health-care \nsoftware. He began this job about seven months ago. He served in the U.S. Navy Reserve \non active duty from 2000 to 2004 and again in 2012 to 2014. He was on Inactive Reserve \nduty from 2004 to 2008. He received an honorable discharge from active duty in 2004. In \n2014, he was suffering from several stressful circumstances and failed to report for duty. \nHe was subsequently discharged and received a general discharge under honorable \nconditions. Applicant attended an online university from July 2008 to 2013. He received \nan associate\u2019s degree. The university subsequently lost its accreditation. (Tr. at 25-36, \n72; GE 2 at 1, 2.) \n2 \n\nFollowing his discharge from the Navy in 2004, Applicant did not have any \nsignificant employment opportunities. He experienced periods of unemployment and \nhomelessness, starting in 2007. He also met his current wife in 2007 while still married to \nhis second wife. He and his current wife were homeless together for about three years, \nincluding living on the streets for about eight months. When the couple had a child in \n2010, he was able to afford a home for his family. Over the years preceding 2012, he \nincurred a financial obligation for arrearages in his child-support payments for his four \noldest children totaling about $70,000. He is presently paying down the arrearage every \nmonth. He currently owes about $65,000. For many years, he was unsuccessful finding \ngood-paying jobs because of his child-support delinquency, which appeared on his credit \nreport and was checked by prospective employers. (Tr. at 73-79.) \nFor ease of discussion, the SOR allegations will not be discussed in the order \nalleged in the SOR. \nParagraph 2, Guideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \n \nThe Illegal Alien Status of Applicant\u2019s Wife \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the single allegation under Guideline E. The \nallegation is as follows: \na. You are married to and living with your wife, who has illegally remained \nin the U.S. since the expiration of her visa in 2007. \nThe factual background regarding this allegation is the following. Applicant married \nhis second wife in 2005 after his first discharge from the Navy Reserve. She was a citizen \nof Uzbekistan. Applicant testified that \u201cshe was pretty hot,\u201d and he did not want to lose \nher. He sponsored her to obtain resident alien status in the United States. As soon as she \nreceived her permanent resident card, she left him to be with a man who was Russian. \nApplicant felt used by her. (Tr. at 43-55.) \nIn 2007, Applicant met his current wife, a Russian citizen. She did not have a \npermanent resident card and her visa was about to expire. He was reluctant to take on \nthe responsibility of helping another woman from the former U.S.S.R. obtain legal status \nto remain in the United States and risk being used again. Eventually, the relationship \ndeveloped, and he came to realize that she was not with him so that he could help her \nobtain a green card and U.S. citizenship. He was, however, experiencing serious financial \nand employment problems and could not afford to help her change her immigration status. \nOver the subsequent years, she was ineligible to work in the United States and never \ntried to do so. They began looking for help on her status in 2012, two years after the birth \nof their child. But even then, Applicant still had debts he could not pay, including the large \nchild-support arrearage. They looked at her immigration status again in 2017 and hired \nan attorney. Applicant\u2019s financial problems prevented them from taking any further steps. \nThey began exploring the necessary steps to change her status a month or two prior to \nthe hearing. He testified that he was \u201c100% positive\u201d that he would be filing the necessary \n3 \n\npapers to start the process during the following four weeks. He was given until June 18, \n2021, to produce evidence of his filing. He did not include any immigration documents \nwith his June 14, 2021 submission. (Tr. at 43-55, 70-74, 121.) \nParagraph 1, Guideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Wife and her Russian Family Members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na. Applicant\u2019s wife is a Russian citizen. As noted, she resides illegally in the United \nStates. She is an ethnic minority from Siberia and is ethnically Asian rather than Russian. \nHer ethnic group is the subject of significant societal prejudice and mistreatment in \nRussia. One reason she left Russia and has stayed away despite multiple hardships of \nliving in the United States without a valid visa is that she believes the alternative of living \nin Russia would be worse. She strongly supports the United States and is opposed to the \nRussian Government. Her only significant connection to Russia is through her mother \nbecause her mother lives there. By way of background, she grew up in a Siberian village \nof 300 to 400 people. She graduated from high school and went to university in Moscow, \nearning a master\u2019s degree in history. She also served in the Russian military. At age 21, \nshe traveled to the United States for the first time on a four-month summer work visa. She \nreturned to Russia on time as required. Two years later, in 2007, she traveled to the \nUnited States again on a similar summer work visa. Then she met Applicant and decided \nto stay with him, even though he was homeless at that time. She overstayed her visa two \nmonths after meeting Applicant. She was seeking to escape from an abusive personal \nrelationship in Russia. Three years later, she and Applicant had a child. She was 27 at \nthe time. She has not returned to Russia in the last 14 years. She is now 37 years old. \nShe suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and is confined to a wheelchair. (Tr. at 36-50, 59-\n60, 66-67, 71-72.) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the four allegations under Guideline B. The \nallegations are as follows: \nb.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law (MIL) is a citizen and resident of Russia. Like her \ndaughter, she is part of an ethnic minority living in Siberia. Her husband, the father of \nApplicant\u2019s wife, is deceased. In addition to Applicant\u2019s wife, MIL has two other children, \na son and another daughter. MIL is 72 years old and is a retired school teacher. Her \nhusband was also a school teacher. Neither Applicant nor his wife have ever sent money \nto help support her mother or either of her two siblings. MIL has never worked for the \nRussian Government. She and Applicant\u2019s wife have a strained relationship because of \nher daughter\u2019s decision to leave Russia and marry a U.S. citizen who was homeless and \nunable to support his wife. In the last 14 years, they have talked on the phone about 12 \ntimes. The have communicated a little more frequently through the Internet. MIL has \nnever met her grandchild in person, though she has seen the child on computer or phone \nscreens. MIL does not speak English and Applicant does not speak Russian or MIL\u2019s \nnative ethnic language. (Tr. at 51-59, 65.) \n4 \n\n Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law (BIL) is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant has \nseen him three times over video screens around the holidays. He works as an engineer, \nto the best of Applicant\u2019s knowledge. He has never worked for the Russian Government. \nBIL rarely communicates with Applicant\u2019s wife because they have a difficult relationship. \nBIL and Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law (SIL) helped pay for their sister\u2019s education, and they are \nupset with her that she left Russia and her family behind to live in a country where she \ncannot even work legally. BIL and SIL have told her to come home and have asked \nApplicant\u2019s wife why she is still living in the United States. In the past 14 years, Applicant\u2019s \nwife has talked with her siblings on the phone only 12 to 14 times. These conversations \ntypically end poorly with Applicant\u2019s wife feeling badly. (Tr. at 60.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nc.\nd. SIL is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant has seen her two times over \nvideo screens around the holidays. The last Applicant knew, SIL worked as an accountant \nfor the business of a family friend. She has never worked for the Russian Government. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has not spoken with her sister in three years. (Tr. at 61.) \nAdministrative Notice \nRussia has a highly centralized, authoritarian political system dominated by its \nPresident. Russian intelligence services target the United States seeking to collect \nintelligence, erode U.S. democracy, undermine U.S. national policies and foreign \nrelationships, and increase Russia\u2019s global position and influence. The U.S. Government \nassesses Russia as posing a cyber espionage, influence, and attack threat to the United \nStates and as having interfered in the integrity of U.S. elections. Russia continues to \noccupy and purports to have annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. The Russian \nGovernment has engaged in significant human rights abuses of its citizens. \nParagraph 3, Guideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nSOR Debts \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is delinquent on debts owed to 17 creditors in the \ntotal amount of about $29,000. In his Answer, Applicant admitted ten of the SOR debts \nand totaling about $24,000. The SOR debts, Applicant\u2019s response to each allegation in \nhis Answer, and the record evidence regarding each debt are described below. \n3.a. Admitted medical account in the amount of $105. Applicant has not paid this debt. \nHe wrote in AE I, his June 14, 2021 email, that he has been unable to learn more about \nhis medical bills. See 3.n, below, for further information. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. \nat 80-81; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 6; AE I.) \n3.b. Denied medical-account in the amount of $425. Applicant has not paid this debt. \nAt the hearing, he was unable to explain why he disputed this debt in his Answer. He \nwrote in his June 14, 2021 email that he has been unable to learn more about his medical \nbills. See 3.n, below, for further information. This debt is not resolved.

Admitted education loan account in the amount of $1,737. Applicant\u2019s six \neducation loans that are the subject of SOR subparagraphs 3.c through 3.h were opened \nduring the period November 2011 through January 2013. He repaid the student loans for \nabout four months and then stopped. They became delinquent in 2015. In his Answer, he \nadmitted he was delinquent on this debt and his other student loans. (Answer at 1, 2; Tr. \nat 88-93; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8.) \nA class-action lawsuit was filed against the university attended by Applicant, and \nhe is a member of the class. Applicant wrote in his Answer that his university has \u201cbeen \nordered to eliminate debt owed [by its students] as part of the [lawsuit].\u201d The basis of the \nlitigation was that the university had engaged in fraudulent student recruitment activity. \nApplicant testified that he is hoping to have these student loan debts removed from his \ncredit. Applicant attached a document to his Answer that states that the university has \nagreed in the settlement \u201cto write to request deletion of any negative credit events it \nreported about you [Applicant] from January 1, 2008 to December 15, 2016.\u201d (Emphasis \nadded.) Applicant actually paid his tuition using the GI Bill. Separately, the funds he \nborrowed were paid to him, not to the university. There is nothing in the record to suggest \nthat Applicant borrowed any funds from or through the university or that the university \nreported any negative credit events about Applicant to a credit bureau. The credit reports \nin the record state that the loans have been assigned to U.S. Department of Education \n(DOE) for collection and that they were originally \u201cDirect Loans,\u201d which are Federal loans. \n(Answer at 2, 11; Tr. at 88-93; GE 2 at 5.) \nApplicant has been trying to figure out how he can take advantage of the settlement \nof the class-action lawsuit to extinguish his student-loan debt owed to DOE, assuming \nthat is even possible. The document he attached to his Answer specifically states that the \nsettlement does not \u201caffect your ability to claim debt forgiveness or submit a Borrower \nDefense to Repayment claim\u201d based upon the legal theories alleged in the litigation. \nApplicant presented no evidence suggesting that he has taken any such actions. (Answer \nat 11.) \nThere is also no documentary evidence in the record that the settlement would \nresult in the extinguishment of any student loans incurred by Settlement Class Members \nfrom any sources or the removal of those debts from the credit reports of the members. \nApplicant has not shown that he made a demand on the university that it request the \ndeletion of any negative information it may have reported to the credit bureaus. In his \npost-hearing email, Applicant asserts that he has been advised by a representative of the \nuniversity that it will submit at a later date a request to the credit bureaus to remove the \nstudent-loan debts. (AE A.) \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided a copy of a court order, dated \nOctober 8, 2020, approving the settlement of the class-action lawsuit. The order does not \ninclude the actual Settlement Agreement of the litigation, which provides the specific \nterms of the relief or payments to be awarded to each \u201cSettlement Class Member.\u201d The \norder does note at paragraph 20 that checks sent to Settlement Class Members that were \nnot cashed within 90 days would be forfeited, which suggests that the relief from the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is not prioritizing the repayment of his delinquent student loans at this \ntime. He is saving the available funds to help pay for his wife\u2019s naturalization as a U.S. \ncitizen. In his background interview, Applicant claimed that he was waiting to repay these \nloans until after the U.S. Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs pays its portion of his education \nexpenses. This statement is inconsistent with his hearing testimony about the class-action \nlitigation. Based upon the record evidence, Applicant remains liable on this student loan \nand the others. This debt has not been resolved. (Answer at 11; Tr. at 88-93; GE 2 at \n5; AE A.; AE I.) \n \n \n \n \nsettlement fund of about $45,000,000 would be in the form of payments to the members. \nThere is no evidence, documentary or otherwise, in the record as to whether Applicant \ntimely submitted the required Claim Form to receive a payment, whether he received that \nclass-action settlement payment, and whether he timely cashed the check. (AE A.) \n3.d-3.h. Admitted education loan accounts in the amount of $4,005; $2,001; $2,917; \n$1,951; and $9,055, respectively. Applicant has not paid these debts. See 3.c, above. \nThese debts have not been resolved. (GE 3 at 3-4; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 9.) \n3.i. Admitted Credit Account in the amount of $144. Applicant wrote in his Answer that \nhe intends to pay this debt when he receives his next paycheck, and in any event, prior \nto his hearing. In his October 2018 background interview, he reported that this debt was \npaid in 2014 and that he had an account with this bank, which was in current status. \nApplicant testified that he paid off this debt and would provide evidence of the payment \nin a post-hearing submission. In his post-hearing email, Applicant again asserted that this \ndebt has been paid, though he did not say when he made the payment. He wrote that the \ncreditor advised him that it could not provide evidence of the payment in a timely manner. \nThe Government\u2019s February 12, 2021 Equifax credit report in the record (GE 3) continues \nto list this debt as unpaid. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence of payment, such \nas a copy of a check or a credit-card statement. Applicant has not documented that \nthis debt has been resolved. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 93-94; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at \n4; GE 6 at 9; AE I.) \n3.j. Denied utility account in the amount of $347. Applicant disputes this debt as \nfraudulent. In his Answer, he claimed that his roommate at the time put this electric bill in \nApplicant\u2019s name without his permission after Applicant left the premises. Applicant \ntestified that he and his wife never had an account with this creditor. He also said that he \nconfronted his former roommate and determined that the roommate had nothing to do \nwith this debt. He testified that he has disputed the bill with the credit bureaus, but he has \nnot contacted the creditor and asked for a record of this bill or otherwise disputed the debt \ndirectly with the creditor. The Government\u2019s most recent credit report, GE 3, does not \nreflect that this bill is disputed. Applicant wrote in his post-hearing email that he recently \ncalled the utility company and disputed the debt. He was advised that it would be removed \nfrom his credit in 30 to 60 days. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 94-97; \nGE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 5-6; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8.; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE I.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.k. Denied fitness center account in the amount of $406. Applicant disputes this debt \nfor monthly membership fees at a fitness center for months after he had canceled his \nmembership and relocated to another state. He claims that the center\u2019s manager agreed \nthat the bill was an error. The debt has since been eliminated from the Government\u2019s \nmost recent credit reports, i.e., GE 3, 4 and 5. This debt has been resolved. (Answer at \n2; Tr. at 98-99; GE 6 at 6.) \n3.l. Admitted communications account in the amount of $235. This debt is for internet \nand cable equipment that Applicant failed to return after moving out of an apartment. After \nlearning that this debt was on his credit report, he returned the equipment and paid $100. \nThe debt does not appear on the Government\u2019s more recent credit report, GE 3. This \ndebt has been resolved. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 99-100; GE 6 at 6.) \n3.m. Denied medical account in the amount of $423. Applicant has not paid this debt. \nAt the hearing, he was unable to explain why he disputed the debt in his Answer. He \nwrote in his June 14, 2021 email that he has been unable to learn more about his medical \nbills. See 3.n, below, for further information. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 81-85; GE \n6 at 7.) \n3.n. Admitted medical account in the amount of $1,988. Applicant testified that this \ndebt or one of the other large medical debts was not actually incurred for medical services. \nHe entered this debt into the hospital\u2019s records as part of his training on how to use the \nhospital billing system software, and he failed to delete the debt when the training was \ncompleted. He has not taken any steps, however, to correct the bill. In his background \ninterview, he reported that he has high blood pressure and has sought care at hospital \nemergency rooms on several occasions. He acknowledged that he had some unpaid \nmedical bills due to his condition and emergency treatment. This debt has not been \nresolved. (Tr. at 83-88; GE 2 at 5; GE 6 at 7.) \n3.o. Denied medical account in the amount of $958. At the hearing, he was unable to \nexplain why he disputed the debt in his Answer. He wrote in his June 14, 2021 email that \nhe has been unable to learn more about his medical bills. See 3.n, above, for further \ninformation. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 81-85; GE 6 at 7; AE I.) \n3.p. Denied medical account in the amount of $1,106. At the hearing, he was unable \nto explain why he disputed the debt in his Answer. He wrote in his June 14, 2021 email \nthat he has been unable to learn more about his medical bills. See 3.n, above, for further \ninformation. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 81-85; GE 6 at 7.) \n3.q. Denied residential rental account in the amount of $1,125. Applicant and his \nfamily lived in this apartment complex starting in 2010 after about three years of \nhomelessness. This debt is for cleaning fees at the end of the rental term.

DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures \ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be \nmade. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility for a public \ntrust position, the administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in the AGs. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable national \nsecurity eligibility decision. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nSOR Paragraph 1, Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7: \n(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 8 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Three of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nWith respect to his wife\u2019s three family members in Russia, Applicant has \nestablished all three mitigating conditions. The nature of the relationships of Applicant\u2019s \nwife with her Russian family members and the positions of those family members is such \nthat it is unlikely that Applicant would have to choose between the interests of his wife\u2019s \nfamily and the interests of the United States. Also, there is no conflict of interest because \nthe sense of loyalty of Applicant and his wife to her Russian family is minimal and the \ncouple\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States are such \nthat Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. And lastly, Applicant and his wife have such casual and infrequent contacts and \ncommunication with her Russian family members that there is little likelihood that the \nrelationships could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his wife\u2019s Russian \ncitizenship. As noted below under Guideline E, Applicant is vulnerable to a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, manipulation or coercion due to his cohabitation with his wife, \nthe mother of his child. He is exposed to having to choose between the interests of his \nwife, who is subject to deportation to Russia, and the interests of the United States. His \nsituation also gives rise to a conflict of interest. Lastly, he has non-casual, daily contact \nwith his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) have not been established. \nOverall, Applicant has not mitigated all of the security concerns under Guideline B. \nSOR paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR Paragraph 2, Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and his testimony, as well as the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, raise the possibility that the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 16 apply: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; . . . and \n(g): association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nAt the time Applicant entered into a second relationship with a foreign national \nwithout a visa to remain in the United States, he exercised questionable judgment and a \ndisregard for the immigration laws of the United States. That situation has continued since \n2007. AG \u00b6 16(d) is established. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is also established. Applicant\u2019s marriage and co-habitation with an \nillegal alien from Russia creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress by \na Russian intelligence agency. The Appeal Board noted that \u201csharing living quarters with \nsomeone who is in violation of U.S. immigration laws poses the requisite heightened risk\u201d \nof exploitation. That is, it is foreseeable that this relationship is one that could be exploited \nby those interested in acquiring U.S. [protected] information, should it come to their \nattention.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-00693 at 2 (App. Bd.

She legally entered the United States in 2007, and \nas a result, did not commit the crime of unlawful entry under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71325(a). AG \u00b6 \n16(g) is not established. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Two conditions have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant had full knowledge of the immigration rules from his first marriage to a \nforeign national. He knew that living in the United States without a valid visa was not a \nminor violation of U.S. law. He was aware that his current wife could have been deported \nat any time over the past 14 years and that this risk continues. He did not repeat the \nprocess to obtain a permanent resident card for his current wife. When given the \nopportunity to submit her application to the immigration officials and present a copy of it \nafter the hearing as additional evidence in mitigation, he failed to do so. Applicant has not \nmitigated doubts that his inaction about his wife\u2019s immigration status has created about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Moreover, he has not taken the steps \nnecessary to reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by filing the \npaperwork to seek the legalization of his wife\u2019s immigration status and submitting that \npaperwork into the record in this case when given the opportunity to do so after the \nhearing. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (e) have not been established \nSOR Paragraph 3, Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR Answer and his testimony, as well as the \ndocumentary evidence in the record, establish the following disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Four of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

In addition, he exercised poor judgment marrying and \nsupporting his second wife, who was born in Uzbekistan and spending his limited financial \nresources trying to help her become a legalized resident alien. As a result, those \nresources were not available to pay down his substantial child-support arrearage. He \nagain exercised poor judgment in marrying another foreign-born woman who did not have \nlegal status to live and work in the United States. He was unable to support her and the \ncouple were homeless for an extended period. Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is \ninsufficient to meet his burden to show that he is reliable, trustworthy, and has good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. After his discharge from the Navy Reserve \nin \n2004, \nApplicant \nexperienced \nextended \nperiods \nof \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment. This caused him to be unable to pay his child-support obligations, \nwhich hindered his ability to secure suitable new employment. This became a circular \nproblem resulting in extreme poverty and homelessness. He finally broke out of that circle \nand has a viable career as a software instructor earning a living that could support his \nfamily if he had no other financial obligations. His chief concern today is saving to help \npay for his wife\u2019s legalization in the United States. As of this point in time, he has a \nsubstantial amount of student loans that he is unable to pay or otherwise resolve and \ncannot afford to pay several smaller medical and other bills. Applicant\u2019s evidence in \nmitigation is insufficient to meet his burden to show that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. Applicant claims that he received financial \nassistance with respect to SOR debt 3.q, but he failed to provide any documentation to \nestablish that as a fact, or even that he has retained a reputable financial counselor. \nMoreover, there is insufficient evidence of debt resolution to establish that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s evidence of making a good-faith effort to \nresolve his debts is limited to just three small SOR debts, 3.i, 3.j, and 3.k. Even with those \ndebts, there is no documentary evidence of payments. Applicant has not produced \nevidence of a sufficient track record of payments to satisfy the requirements of this \nmitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputed seven debts in his Answer. His \nevidence was insufficient to establish that he had a reasonable basis to dispute the debts, \nand he failed to provide documentation to substantiate the basis of the disputes. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Additional comments are \nwarranted. I have given weight to Applicant\u2019s service in the Navy Reserve.

Her request \nfor national security eligibility and a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 6, 2020, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive \n5220.6, as amended (Directive), the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns \nunder Guideline B. The SOR further informed Applicant that based on information \navailable to the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 17, 2020, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nOctober 19, 2020. The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2020. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 13, \n2020, scheduling the hearing for January 21, 2021. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. The record was left \nopen for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant presented two documents, which \nI marked Applicant Exhibits A and B, and admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 29, 2021. \nProcedural Ruling \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (China). Department Counsel provided a 14-page \nsummary of the facts, supported by relevant excerpts from 33 Government documents \npertaining to China, identified as Government Exhibit 6. The documents provide \nelaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts \nincluded in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. The facts so noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all six SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old and married with two children. Applicant has a Master\u2019s \ndegree in Engineering. She has been employed by the same defense contractor since \n1997, with a three-year break in service to care for her two sons between January 2015 \nand November 2017. At that point she returned to work. She held a security clearance \nduring her earlier period of employment without incident. She is attempting to reacquire \nnational security eligibility. (Government Exhibit 4 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because she has foreign contacts that could possibly lead to divided loyalties. \nApplicant was born in China in 1964. After finishing undergraduate school in China \nApplicant moved to the United States in 1990 to attend graduate school. As stated, she \nfirst began working for her present employer in 1997. She became an American citizen \nin 2000. Her husband, who was also born in China, is a naturalized American citizen. \nHer two children were born in the United States. (Government Exhibit 4 at Sections 9, \n17, 18; Tr. 25-26.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n1.a. Applicant\u2019s mother is 83 years old. Before she retired in approximately 2000 \nshe was a professor at a university in China.  \n \n \n1.b. Applicant\u2019s father is 85 years old. He retired in 1998 as a professor at a \nuniversity in China. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.f. Applicant sponsored her mother and father to live full-time in the United \nStates as lawful permanent residents from 2000 to 2014. From 2004 to 2014 her \nparents would visit the United States every year of so for three months to retain their \nstatus as lawful permanent residents. They have not returned to the United States since \n2014 and no longer have permanent resident status. They continue to live in China. \nApplicant has regular contact with her parents to talk about their health. (Tr. 26-33.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of China. He is 49 years old. \nApplicant does not know the exact nature of his business activities in China. At one \npoint her brother was a lawful permanent resident of the United States and would visit \nthe United States on a regular basis, the last time being in 2018. According to Applicant, \n\u201cWe had very little in common and we hardly can understand each other\u2019s situations. \nOver the years, our only point of communication is around our parent\u2019s health and our \nchildren.\u201d (Government Exhibit 5 at 3; Applicant Exhibit A at 1; Tr. 33-35.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant has two brothers-in-law who are citizens and residents of China. \nOne is a farmer. The other brother-in-law is a road engineer. (Government Exhibit 4 at \n3-4; Applicant Exhibit A at 1-2; Tr. 35-36, 39-40.)  \n \n \n1.e. Applicant has three sisters-in-law. One is married to her brother. That sister-\nin-law is a teacher. She is also a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The \nsecond is married to the farmer, discussed above. She is a homemaker. The third is \nmarried to the road engineer, discussed above. She is also a homemaker.

(See \nTr. 22-23.) \nAll of these in-laws, except her brother\u2019s wife, are from a province hundreds of \nmiles away from where Applicant grew up. She has had very little contact with them \nover the years. Their dialect is dramatically different from Mandarin, which Applicant \nspeaks. She testified, \u201cI had hard time to understand and communicate with them. So, \nfor all those years, only the [sic] way to contact them is to send seasonal greetings at \nthe Chinese New Year.\u201d (Tr. 20-21.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigation \nApplicant has lived in the United States over 30 years. She states: \nI was lucky to have a chance to study abroad for my Master\u2019s Degree in \nthe United States. And I really appreciated the opportunity that the United \nStates has offered me. And I\u2019m determined to contribute through my hard \nwork and my technical skills. In my heart, I strong (sic) believe the ideas \nthat this country holds dear, and I hope that I am able to provide my skills \nand expertise to the Government programs. Also, I would stand for the \nbenefit of this country which give my husband, two sons and I a wonderful \nlife. And I wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt this country. (Tr. 23.) \nApplicant owns no property in China. Nor does she have any bank accounts in \nChina. Applicant has substantial monetary and property interests in the United States. \n(Tr. 42-47.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s department manager submitted a letter on her behalf. This man has \nbeen her supervisor since she originally went to work for her defense contractor \nemployer in 1997. He recommended her to receive her initial clearance, and further \nrecommends that she receive national security eligibility at this time. He states, \u201cDuring \nthe time that [Applicant] held a DOD secret clearance, there were never any security \nviolations and she followed all the rules to safeguard classified and proprietary \ninformation.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChina \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Administrative Notice \ndocuments concerning China, which are incorporated herein by reference. \nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of more \nthan billion people and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. It has a poor \nrecord with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and engages in \narbitrary arrests and detentions, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners. \nChina is one of the most aggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected \nU.S. technology and economic intelligence. It targets the United States with active \nintelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. As a result, it is a growing threat \nto U.S. national security.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother and various in-laws live in China. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nChina is an active collector of industrial espionage. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s \nfamily connections in that country have the potential to generate a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a \nforeign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create a risk of foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has minimal contact with her in-laws who live in China. She does have \nregular contact with her parents, though it is primarily about their health. On the other \nhand, Applicant has lived in the United States for 30 years and been a citizen for 20 \nyears. Her husband and two children are also American citizens. Beyond her family, she \nhas substantial financial ties to the United States and none in China. \nApplicant is a proud American citizen. She appreciates and understands on a \ndeeply personal level the benefits of American citizenship. Applicant also understands \nthe responsibilities that come with holding a security clearance, and has a 20-year \nhistory of fulfilling them. (Applicant Exhibits A and B; Tr. 24, 54.) \nBased on the evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. Applicant has completely \nmitigated the security significance of the presence of her relatives in China. Paragraph 1 \nis found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has exhibited no potential for \ncoercion or duress. She is knowledgeable of her security responsibilities. Her \nconnections in the United States far outweigh those in China, even under the \nheightened risk standard. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence, \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The LLC holds a facility clearance and Applicant serves as the assistant facility security manager. Initially, Applicant worked as an employee of the LLC, but since 2005, he has worked as an independent subcontractor to the LLC. He performs work as a sub-subcontractor through the LLC for larger federal contracting companies. He has worked on his current contract since 2015.

He completed his most recent security clearance application in October 2018, disclosing financial problems to include: failure to pay state and federal income taxes for multiple years; a federal tax lien; and a 2018 home foreclosure. The SOR alleges that that Applicant owes $84,749 on a charged-off mortgage loan (SOR \u00b61.a,); that he lost a home to foreclosure in 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he has a $1,015 past-due balance on a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he has three outstanding state tax liens, totaling over $105,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.f); and that he owes over $315,000 in outstanding federal incomes taxes, including a lien for $145,920 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \u2013 1.i).

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May \n28, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 57, has owned one-third of a small limited liability corporation (LLC) \nfederal contracting company since 2002. The LLC holds a facility clearance and \nApplicant serves as the assistant facility security manager.  Initially, Applicant worked as \nan employee of the LLC, but since 2005, he has worked as an independent \nsubcontractor to the LLC. He performs work as a sub-subcontractor through the LLC for \nlarger federal contracting companies. He has worked on his current contract since 2015. \n(Tr. 18-29; GE 1) \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1998. He completed his most \nrecent security clearance application in October 2018, disclosing financial problems to \ninclude: failure to pay state and federal income taxes for multiple years; a federal tax \nlien; and a 2018 home foreclosure. The SOR alleges that that Applicant owes $84,749 \non a charged-off mortgage loan (SOR \u00b61.a,); that he lost a home to foreclosure in 2018 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he has a $1,015 past-due balance on a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that \nhe has three outstanding state tax liens, totaling over $105,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.f); and \nthat he owes over $315,000 in outstanding federal incomes taxes, including a lien for \n$145,920 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \u2013 1.i). (Tr. 18-19; GE 1) \nApplicant began to experience financial problems after his marriage in \nSeptember 2006. To appease his wife, Applicant testified that the couple purchased a \nhome they could not afford. In addition, their son required education at a specialized \nschool. When the couple first married, Applicant\u2019s wife owned a small federal \ncontracting business. Together, the couple enjoyed a joint income over $400,000. The \ncouple used the same accountant to handle their separate business and their joint \nfinances. According to Applicant, the accountant advised them about their respective \nestimated income tax obligations based on the income earned from their respective \nbusinesses. Applicant\u2019s wife handled making the estimated tax payments for both \nbusinesses as well as the household bills, while Applicant maintained responsibility for \nthe mortgage on the marital home. (Tr. 31-32) \nFrom at least 2010 to 2015, the couple filed their federal and state income tax \nreturns using the \u2018married filing jointly\u2019 status. For the 2010 and 2011 tax years, the \ncouple did not make any estimated tax payments, but did report W-2 withholdings. They \nsatisfied their additional tax liabilities through a series of payments. In 2012 and 2013, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe couple did not make estimated payments or withhold income taxes from their pay. \nThe couple resolved the 2013 tax liability through payments, but they did not make any \npayments on the 2012 liability. In 2015, the IRS issued a lien against the couple for the \n$145,925 tax liability for the 2012 tax year. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) For reasons that are unclear \nfrom the record, the IRS wrote off the entire balance in April 2019. (GE 5) \nIn 2014, the couple began making estimated tax payments. That year, the \nestimated tax payments exceeded their tax obligations. In 2015, despite their W-2 \nwithholdings and estimated tax payments, the couple still owed additional federal taxes. \nThe couple amended their 2015 income tax return twice and submitted an Offer in \nCompromise for the outstanding balance. In response, the IRS reduced the couple\u2019s tax \nliability obligation and then wrote off the remaining balance, satisfying their tax \nobligation for the 2015 tax year. (GE 5) \nAs the marriage deteriorated, Applicant\u2019s financial problems worsened. For the \n2016 and the 2017 tax years, Applicant filed his federal income tax returns using the \n\u2018married filing separately\u2019 status, which allowed him to pay income taxes only on his \nincome. Using that status also made him solely responsible for any resulting federal tax \nliability. For the 2016 tax year, he paid $64,500 in estimated taxes. After reviewing the \nreturn, the IRS assessed Applicant an additional $29,910 in federal income tax. The IRS \napplied an overpayment from 2018 to the 2016 tax liability, resulting a $76,742 balance. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) In April 2017, Applicant\u2019s estranged wife barred him from the marital home, \nrequiring Applicant to secure new housing. In addition to paying his living expenses, \nApplicant agreed to pay his estranged wife $7,500 each month in undifferentiated \nsupport for herself and their child. That year Applicant paid just $24,000 in estimated \ntaxes. This amount only covered the interest and penalties on the $88,087 tax liability. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i) In addition to the federal tax issues, Applicant and his wife had state tax \nissues. Their state of residence filed three tax liens against them in June 2016 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f, $30,603.66 for tax years 2013 and 2014), January 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, $58,930.69 for \nthe 2015 tax year), and in October 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, $16,177.62 for the 2016 tax year), \nrespectively. (Tr. 33, 78-80; GE 6-7; AE F) \nApplicant\u2019s separation caused other financial problems. Under the terms of the \ncouple\u2019s separation agreement, Applicant\u2019s estranged wife retained possession of the \nmartial home. Applicant mistakenly believed that his wife was responsible for paying the \nmortgage and line of credit on the home. However, the separation order required \nApplicant retain responsibility for the payment of the mortgage, line of credit, or other \nliens placed on the marital home. Neither party paid the mortgage, resulting in a 2018 \nhome foreclosure. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Although the foreclosure sale satisfied the balance on \nthe primary mortgage, it did not cover the $84,749 balance of the line of credit on the \nhome. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant settled the line of credit in July 2021 for $9,500. Applicant \nalso had a credit card with a past-due balance of $1,015, but that account is now \ncurrent. (Tr. 37-40; GE 8; AE F, K) \n3 \n \nIn late 2017, Applicant retained a lawyer to help him resolve his state and federal \ntax issues. Applicant resolved the June 2016 state tax lien (SOR \u00b6 1.f, $30,603.66) \nthrough a payment plan in April 2020. He resolved the January 2018 state tax lien (SOR \n\n \n \n \n \nIn a May 2021 letter, Applicant\u2019s tax attorney provided the status of Applicant\u2019s \nfederal and state income tax obligations: \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00b6 1.e, $58,930.69) in April 2021. Although Applicant did not provide a copy of the lien \nrelease for the lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($16, 177), a May 2021 letter from his tax \nattorney represented that Applicant satisfied all outstanding state tax liabilities as of \nApril 2021. Even though the state tax liens were issued jointly, Applicant resolved the \nliens without help from his ex-wife. However, Applicant\u2019s 2016 and 2017 federal tax \nliabilities, totaling $169,821, remain unpaid. (Tr. 34-35, 81-82; GE 4; AE B) \n \nThe first step in resolving a tax debt with the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) and the [state comptroller] requires the taxpayer to be in tax \ncompliance. To be considered in \"tax compliance\" all tax filings need to be \ntimely filed and there are adequate tax withholdings and/or estimated tax \npayments to cover the current years tax. [Applicant] is in current tax \ncompliance and has been since 2018. [Applicant\u2019s] tax debts are for years \n2017 and prior. \nWhen a taxpayer cannot fully pay a tax debt, the IRS allows collection \nalternatives such as a payment plan or an offer in compromise. We have \nbeen diligently contacting the IRS to obtain a collection alternative for \n[Applicant] without success. [Applicant\u2019s] file remains in a queue waiting to \nbe assigned to an IRS Revenue Officer (a local IRS employee who \ncollects tax debts). While in this pending status, the IRS will not negotiate \na collection alternative. This extraordinary delay is likely a result of \nreduced IRS employment levels and the pandemic. We stand ready for \nwhen [Applicant\u2019s] matter is assigned to a Revenue Officer. (AE A) \nIn a June 2021 update, Applicant\u2019s attorney further explained: \nUnfortunately, in [Applicant\u2019s] case (like many other taxpayers), the case \ncannot be resolved until the matter has been assigned to a revenue officer. \n([Applicant] does not have the current ability to pay the liabilities in full and \nhis case cannot be resolved over-the-phone.) On [Applicant\u2019s] behalf, we \nhave been diligently attempting to resolve this case and have the matter \nassigned to a revenue officer; however, assignment of cases to revenue \nofficers is within the sound discretion of the Internal Revenue Service, \nbased on factors such as need, staffing, and others. In the past few years, \ndue to these factors, it has taken months and, sometimes, years for \nassignment of a case to a revenue officer. We cannot compel a revenue \nofficer to immediately review his matter and resolve these issues - as much \nas we wish we could. \nWhen [Applicant\u2019s] case is ultimately assigned to a revenue officer, we will \nnegotiate a collection alternative (e.g., installment agreement, Offer in \nCompromise, or otherwise) with the Internal Revenue Service to finally \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolve these issues.

I would be happy to provide an update \nwhen we receive further contact from the Internal Revenue Service. (AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima \nfacie case. \nDuring their marriage, Applicant and his wife mismanaged their federal and state \nincome tax obligations. The couple lived beyond their means, causing them to under \npay their estimated taxes and have inadequate income tax withheld from their pay. This \nmismanagement resulted in multiple years of federal and state tax liabilities that they \ncould not pay, as evidenced by a federal tax lien, three state tax liens, and over \n$300,000 in unpaid federal taxes. Although Applicant\u2019s difficult marriage and its ultimate \ndissolution contributed to and exacerbated his financial problems, the problems were \nnot entirely beyond his control. Applicant and his wife made poor financial choices. \nBecause of the strain caused by his financial support obligations, Applicant could not \nafford to pay the mortgage on the marital home, resulting in the foreclosure of the \nproperty in 2018, and a deficiency balance on the line of credit. He also allowed a credit \ncard to become past due. \nThe record supports the application of the following financial considerations \ndisqualifying: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.  \nHowever, in the aftermath of his separation and divorce, Applicant acted \nresponsibility by trying to repay his creditors. In 2017, he hired a tax attorney to help him \nresolve his federal and state tax issues. Since 2018, he has been in compliance with his \nfederal and state income tax obligations, making estimated tax payments and timely \nfiling his federal and state income tax returns. He has paid the three outstanding state \ntax liens. He has not incurred any additional state or federal income tax liabilities since \n2018. \nFor reasons that are unclear from the record, the IRS wrote off over $145,000 of \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax liability, resulting in the release of the 2014 tax lien. However, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant still owes over $169,000 in federal income taxes for the 2016 and 2017 tax \nyears. Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve this federal income tax debt. \nHe has made a request to the IRS to negotiate an offer in compromise and is waiting for \nthe IRS to assign his case to a revenue officer. Although he is prepared to proceed with \nnegotiations, the IRS is under no obligation to do so or to accept a lesser amount. \nThe following mitigating conditions are partially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were \nlargely beyond the persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual had made arrangement with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangement. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has held a security clearance without incident for \nover 20 years. While Applicant has demonstrated his willingness to resolve his \noutstanding federal tax liability, the record does not contain a sufficient history of tax \ncompliance or repayment of his outstanding federal tax debt to fully mitigate the alleged \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n________________________ \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nApplicant paid for the services of prostitutes in Mexico and Amsterdam. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(c) and 13(d) are applicable. It was not established at the hearing that prostitution \nwas illegal in those locations. AG \u00b6 13(a) is not applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been involved with prostitutes since \n2019. He is now engaged and living with his fianc\u00e9e, who is aware of his \ntransgressions. I do not believe the conduct will be repeated. The above mitigating \nconditions are sufficiently applicable to overcome sexual behavior security concerns. \nThe poor judgment aspects of the behavior will be addressed further under personal \nconduct. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms, including \nwhile holding a security clearance. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after October 2016. The analysis \nhere is similar to the sexual behavior analysis. I do not believe Applicant will use illegal \ndrugs again. I find that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate \nperiod, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are \napplicable. The aspects of the behavior reflecting questionable judgment will be \naddressed further under personal conduct. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s solicitation of prostitutes and drug involvement were cross-alleged \nunder criminal conduct. It was not established at the hearing that prostitution was illegal \nin the locations where Applicant solicited prostitutes, but his drug possession was in \nviolation of federal law. The above disqualifying condition is applicable to the drug \ninvolvement, but not the solicitation of prostitutes. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe discussion above under drug involvement and substance misuse applies \nequally here. I find the conduct is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicable. Similar to the sexual behavior and drug involvement discussions, the poor \njudgment aspects of the criminal behavior will be addressed further under personal \nconduct. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; and \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and involvement with prostitutes are cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nApplicant intentionally provided false information about his marijuana use on the \n2015 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 4.c alleges that Applicant intentionally concealed his 2016 use of \nmarijuana and psilocybin mushrooms from his FSO from no later than July 2017 \nthrough October 2017, knowing that the National Industrial Security Program Operating \nManual (NIS POM), Chapter 1, Section 3, paragraph 1-300, required him to disclose the \ninformation. Applicant admitted that he knew by reading brochures from his company \nthat he had an affirmative duty to self-report his marijuana and mushroom use. He did \nnot admit that he knew that the NIS POM paragraph required him to self-report. That is \nlikely because the cited paragraph does not have a requirement that security clearance \nholders (employees) self-report; it requires contractors (employers) to report. The part of \nSOR \u00b6 4.c that references the NIS POM is concluded for Applicant. That does not \ndetract from Applicant\u2019s disregard of his admitted requirement to self-report his illegal \ndrug use. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThere is a common thread running through Applicant\u2019s misconduct: poor \njudgment and dishonesty. He lied about his drug use on his SF 86, and then continued \nto use illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. He discussed his involvement \nwith prostitutes during his June 2018 background interview, and then he engaged the \nservices of a prostitute in Amsterdam in June 2019. He was less than candid in how he \nreported his conduct to the LCSW during his evaluation, and I have good reason to \nquestion his credibility. While I believe that specific conduct (drugs, prostitutes) is \nunlikely to recur, I am unable to conclude that other problematic conduct is unlikely to \nrecur. The above mitigating conditions are insufficient to overcome ongoing concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D, E, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines D (sexual behavior), H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), and J (criminal conduct), but he did not mitigate \nthe security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct). \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The amended SOR alleges under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant maintains contact with an intelligence officer serving in the IDF (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that Applicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States residing in Israel (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations, but she also stated that she believes the Israeli military officer\u2019s service had ended by the time the March 2020 SOR was issued or will end in 2020; and she completed her initial security clearance application before her sister had moved to Israel. Applicant\u2019s admissions to having had foreign contact with the IDF officer and to the Israeli citizenship and residency of her sister are incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 26-year-old U.S. native-born citizen with a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in December 2016 from a prestigious private university in the United States. She has been employed by her current employer, a U.S.-based defense contractor, since late January 2017. She completed an internal three-year engineering leadership development program (ELDP) with her employer, and during that program, she earned her master\u2019s degree in chemical and aerospace engineering.

The \nDCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn March 28, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR allegation and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppeals (DOHA).

On August 14, 2020, Applicant \nadmitted the allegation with some comments. \nReferral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of the COVID \npandemic. On February 17, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the Government \nwas ready to proceed to a hearing. On February 26, 2021, the case was assigned to me \nto conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case \nassignment and file on March 4, 2021. On March 8, 2021, I informed Applicant of the \npossibility of an online hearing. Applicant expressed her willingness to have an online \nvideo hearing. Following a successful test of the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS), \non March 11, 2021, DOHA scheduled a DCS video teleconference hearing for March \n31, 2021. \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s August 28, 2019 Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) was admitted as a Government exhibit (GE 1) without objection. \nDepartment Counsel offered as GE 2 a Request for Administrative Notice \u2013 Israel, \ndated March 30, 2021. I withheld ruling on that document pending a response from \nApplicant after the hearing. Applicant testified at the hearing, as reflected in a transcript \n(Tr.) received on April 14, 2021. \nRuling on Request for Administrative Notice \nAt the hearing, the Government submitted as GE 2 a request for administrative \nnotice concerning Israel dated March 30, 2021. The request was in lieu of a previous \nrequest for administrative notice dated September 30, 2020. The Government\u2019s updated \nrequest for administrative notice was based, in part, on five publications of the U.S. \nState Department: 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \u2013 Israel, West \nBank, and Gaza, dated March 11, 2020; Israel, The West Bank and Gaza Travel \nAdvisory, dated September 23, 2020; Israel 2020 Crime & Safety Report, dated May 4, \n2020; Israel, the West Bank and Gaza International Travel Information, dated November \n24, 2020; and Country Reports on Terrorism 2019, dated June 24, 2020. Additionally, \nsome of the facts proposed for administrative notice were drawn from a publication from \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook \u2013 Israel, dated January 18, 2021, \nand the Congressional Research Service\u2019s report Israel: Background and U.S. \nRelations, dated July 31, 2018. Applicant confirmed that she received the Government\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice with the source documents. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current \npolitical conditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties that I would take administrative notice \nof the facts requested by the Government with respect to Israel, subject to the relevance \nand materiality of the source documentation, including whether the facts are \nsubstantiated by reliable government sources, and subject to any valid objections from \nApplicant. I held the record open after the hearing for Applicant to file any objections to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe admissibility of the Request for Administrative Notice as GE 2 and to submit on her \nbehalf any exhibits or a request for administrative notice or both. On April 9, 2021, \nApplicant indicated that she did not intend to submit any evidentiary exhibits or a \nrequest for administrative notice. In the absence of any objection to GE 2, I accepted \nthe Request for Administrative Notice \u2013 Israel in evidence and closed the record on April \n9, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant \nmaintains contact with an intelligence officer serving in the IDF (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States residing in Israel (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations, but she also stated that she believes the \nIsraeli military officer\u2019s service had ended by the time the March 2020 SOR was issued \nor will end in 2020; and she completed her initial security clearance application before \nher sister had moved to Israel. Applicant\u2019s admissions to having had foreign contact \nwith the IDF officer and to the Israeli citizenship and residency of her sister are \nincorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old U.S. native-born citizen with a bachelor\u2019s degree \nearned in December 2016 from a prestigious private university in the United States. She \nhas been employed by her current employer, a U.S.-based defense contractor, since \nlate January 2017. She completed an internal three-year engineering leadership \ndevelopment program (ELDP) with her employer, and during that program, she earned \nher master\u2019s degree in chemical and aerospace engineering. She currently works as a \nsenior systems engineer and seeks a top secret clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 19-21.) Because \nof the time it has taken to adjudicate her security-clearance eligibility, Applicant has \ntaken on a general systems engineering management role, which can be done at the \nunclassified level. (Tr. 21.) \nApplicant\u2019s parents are U.S. native-born citizens and residents of the United \nStates. Applicant was raised in the United States with her two sisters, who are now \nages 24 and 29. In 2017, Applicant\u2019s older sister moved to Israel for a summer job as a \ngymnastics instructor. (GE 1; Tr. 19, 32.) At the end of that summer, she was offered a \nfull-time job, and she elected to remain in Israel. (Tr. 32-33.) She subsequently obtained \nIsraeli citizenship and is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States. (GE 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s sister is employed as a medical writer for a technology company in Israel. \nShe is dating her current roommate, who is a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen employed as an \nengineer by a U.S.-based corporation in Israel. (Tr. 21-22.) Applicant states that she is \nnot particularly close to her older sister (Tr. 19), explaining that \u201cchildhood resentment \nevolved into just a long-distance tolerance of each other.\u201d (Tr. 28.) Applicant\u2019s sister did \nnot share with Applicant that she had become a dual citizen. When asked by the DOD \nabout her sister\u2019s citizenship status, Applicant made an inquiry of her parents and \nlearned that her sister had acquired her Israeli citizenship. (Tr. 20.) Applicant has \nweekly contact with her sister in Israel during family \u201cteleconference\u201d calls in which their \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparents and sister also participate. Monthly to once every few months, Applicant has \nadditional contact with her sister by social media. (Tr. 23-24.) Applicant had in-person \ncontact with her older sister during family vacations to Europe in July 2018 and July \n2019. She has not seen her sister since the July 2019 trip. (Tr. 24-25.) Applicant plans \nto continue to participate in the weekly family video gatherings with her sister because it \nmakes her mother happy. Applicant sees no reason to change her current relationship \nwith her sister. (Tr. 31-32.) \nApplicant went to Israel for a few weeks from December 2016 to January 2017 \non a \u201cBirthright [Israel] organized trip,\u201d which was designed to introduce young Jewish \nadults to Israel. Applicant and the other Americans on the program were joined by six or \nseven college-age Israelis, including some off-duty members of the IDF. For a week to \nten days, the participants rode a bus together across Israel to various tourist sites and \nwent to a chemical forensics laboratory on an IDF base. (GE 1; Tr. 28-29.) After the trip \nended, Applicant maintained contact with some of the program\u2019s participants, including \nan intelligence officer in the IDF. She and the IDF officer had some common interests, \nand she contacted him monthly by text messaging and social media through August \n2019. (Tr. 26-27, 30.) She reported her contacts with the Israeli national when she \ncompleted a March 2017 SF 86 for a secret clearance (Tr. 31) and on an August 2019 \nSF 86 for a top secret clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 18-19.) She made him aware that she \nreported him as a foreign contact on her SF 86 forms. By the time she completed her \nAugust 2019 SF 86, he had shared with her that he was leaving the IDF to pursue a \nmaster\u2019s degree and possibly a doctorate degree. She does not know for certain that he \nis no longer serving in the IDF. Applicant has had no contact with him since \u201csometime \nin 2019.\u201d (Tr. 26-27). They \u201cgrew apart\u201d and stopped communicating. (Tr. 30.) Applicant \ndoes not currently have any contact with any member of the IDF. (Tr. 33.) \nNeither Applicant nor her family members living in the United States own any \nfinancial assets, including any property, in Israel. (Tr. 27.) Applicant has no current \nplans to travel to Israel in the future. (Tr. 24.) \nAdministrative Notice \nAdministrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of \nspecific facts properly noticed and relevant and material to the issues. Concerning the \nfacts submitted for administrative notice in GE 2, I take administrative notice of the facts \nrequested by the Government, as supplemented by the following facts: \nIsrael is a vibrant parliamentary democracy with a modern economy. Despite the \ninstability and armed conflict that have marked Israel\u2019s relations within the region since \nit came into existence, Israel has developed a robust, diversified, and technologically \nadvanced market economy. Nationwide elections in April 2019, September 2019, and \nMarch 2020 were considered free and fair but failed to form a coalition government. The \npolitical stalemate was resolved in April 2020 with the current Prime Minister, Benjamin \nNetanyahu, to remain in office until October 2021, when Blue and White party leader \nBenny Gantz is scheduled to succeed him. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe relationship between Israel and the United States is friendly and yet \ncomplex. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have had a close friendship based \non common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. Successive \nU.S. Administrations and Congress have demonstrated a commitment to Israel\u2019s \nsecurity and to maintaining close bilateral ties. Israel is considered a critical ally and \nfriend of the United States. The United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital \nin December 2017 without taking a position on Israel\u2019s sovereign boundaries. The \nrelocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem in May 2018 was greeted warmly by Israel \nbut rejected by Palestinians and many other international actors. The United States is \nIsrael\u2019s largest single-country trading partner. Israel is a leading recipient of U.S. foreign \naid and is a frequent purchaser of major U.S. weapons systems. \nIsrael and the United States do not have a mutual defense agreement, although \nthe United States remains committed to Israel\u2019s security and well-being, predicated on \nIsrael maintaining a \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d over other countries in its region. Strong \nU.S. congressional support for Israel resulted in the country being designated as a \n\u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d in 1989 and receiving preferential treatment in bidding for U.S. \ndefense contracts and access to expanded weapons systems at lower prices. \nSignificant cooperation exists in military aid, arms sales, joint exercises, and information \nsharing. Legislation in the U.S. Congress frequently includes proposals to strengthen \nU.S.-Israeli cooperation, such as the U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act \nof 2018. \nYet, the interests of the two countries are not always aligned. The sales of U.S. \ndefense articles or services to Israel and other foreign countries is subject to the \nprovisions of the Arms Export Control Act, which predicates eligibility for purchase on \nagreements not to use purchased items or training for purposes other than those \npermitted by the act or to transfer them to third-party countries (except under certain \nconditions) without the prior consent of the U.S. President. The United States has acted \nto restrict aid and/or rebuked Israel in the past for possible improper use of U.S.-\nsupplied military equipment. Israeli-U.S. relations were strained between Israeli Prime \nMinister Netanyahu\u2019s second administration and the Obama Administration, particularly \nover Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Iran Nuclear Deal. Negotiations \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians have been complicated by Israeli actions, including \na July 2018 law by the Knesset which defined Israel as the national homeland of the \nJewish people and by Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank. Israel is threatened \nby Iran; Iranian-sponsored non-state actors, such as the Lebanese Shiite group \nHizb\u2019allah; and violent jihadist terrorist groups in the region, such as the Islamic State. \nIsrael\u2019s concerns about a nuclear-weapons-capable Iran as an imminent threat to its \nsecurity have led Israel to criticize the international agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogram when it was negotiated in 2015 and to welcome the Trump Administration\u2019s \nwithdrawal of the United States from that agreement in May 2018. \nThe United States has also expressed concern about Israel\u2019s sales of sensitive \nsecurity equipment and technology, especially to China. Since the 1980s, there have \nbeen at least three cases in which U.S. government employees were convicted of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisclosing classified information to Israel or of conspiracy to act as an Israeli agent (e.g., \nJonathan Pollard in 1985, who Israel has acknowledged acted as its agent). U.S. \ngovernment contractors have also been implicated in providing classified and sensitive \ninformation to Israel. \nThe security situation remains complex in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The \nU.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December 2017 and of Israel\u2019s \nsovereignty over the Golan Heights in March 2019, and the U.S. failure to condemn as \nillegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, have led to a recent rise in anti-U.S. \nsentiment, especially in the West Bank. Throughout 2019, hostile organizations \nassociated with designated terrorist groups (Hizb\u2019allah, the Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine (PFLP), Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)) and Iran \nlaunched mortars, rockets, and incendiary devices into Israel. In September 2020, the \nU.S. State Department raised the travel advisory for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza \nfrom Level 2 to Level 3. Travelers are advised to reconsider travel to Israel and the \nWest Bank and to avoid all travel to Gaza due to COVID-19, terrorism and civil unrest, \nand with respect to Gaza also armed conflict. Terrorist groups and known lone-wolf \nterrorists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, and they \ntarget tourist locations, markets, transportation hubs, and local government facilities. \nGaza is under the control of Hamas, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. \nDuring 2019, Palestinian militant groups launched 1,340 rockets and mortars from the \nGaza Strip toward arbitrary or civilian targets in Israel, killing six and injuring more than \n150. Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are considered high-threat locations for terrorism directed \nat or affecting official U.S.-government interests. \nPersons seeking to enter or depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are reminded \nas of January 2021 that they are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly \nincluding prolonged questioning and physical searches, and that they may be denied \nentry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travelers\u2019 \npersonal email accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. \nTravelers are advised that they should have no expectation of privacy for any data \nstored on their devices or in their accounts under those circumstances. \nCivilian authorities in Israel maintained effective control over security services in \nIsrael in 2019. Significant human rights issues in Israel in 2019 included reports of \nunlawful or arbitrary killings by Palestinian terrorist groups in Israel. The Israeli \nintelligence community reported having thwarted more than 500 attempted terrorist \nattacks in 2019. Israeli forces killed Palestinians in the West Bank who were attempting \nor allegedly attempting to attack Israelis, but reportedly some of those killed did not \npose a lethal threat at the time. Human rights groups alleged that the Israeli government \nsometimes used excessive force resulting in the deaths of several Palestinians. Israeli \nsecurity personnel reportedly used \u201cspecial interrogation methods\u201d (beatings, threats of \nrape and physical harm, pressure from restraints, and sleep deprivation) against \nPalestinian security detainees in the West Bank. However, Israel\u2019s government took \nsteps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses within Israel regardless \nof rank or seniority. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. \nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant traveled to Israel on a Birthright Israel organized trip in December \n2016, just before starting her first year of a three-year ELDP with her current employer. \nOne of the Israeli participants in the program was an intelligence officer in the IDF with \nwhom she maintained contact by texting and social media from January 2017 until \nsometime in 2019. Applicant\u2019s older sister is a dual citizen of Israel and the United \nStates, who has been working and living in Israel since the summer of 2017. Review of \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts and connections is warranted to determine whether they \npresent a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under \nAG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying conditions provide: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a \nfamily member or friend living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of \nthe family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are \nrelevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncoercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or \ndependent on, the foreign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. In considering the nature of the foreign \ngovernment, the administrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nIsrael and the United States have long had a close friendship. The United States \nis committed to Israel\u2019s security, to the extent of ensuring that Israel maintains a \n\u201cqualitative military edge\u201d in its region. Israel receives preferential treatment in bidding \nfor U.S. contracts and substantial military aid from the United States. However, \nGuideline B concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United States. Even \nfriendly nations may have interests that are not completely aligned with the United \nStates. The Appeal Board has long held that \u201c[t]he United States has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of \nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-11570 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). There is no \nrecent report showing direct involvement by the Israeli government targeting the United \nStates. However, U.S. government employees and U.S. government contractors have \nbeen implicated in economic espionage activity in the United States to benefit Israel. \nThe U.S. attitude towards Israeli settlements in the West Bank has shifted depending on \nthe administration in power. Israel\u2019s military sales to other countries such as China have \nnot been in the interest of the United States. \nThere is no evidence that Israel has used coercive methods on its resident \ncitizens to obtain U.S. sensitive information. However, it does not eliminate the \npossibility that Israel would employ some non-coercive measures in an attempt to \nexploit a relative, friend, or acquaintance. Israel faces threats by jihadist groups, other \nterrorist organizations, and states in the region that are avowedly anti-Israel. Within \nIsrael, many of those attacks are directed at Jewish or Israeli interests. Israel attempts \nto prevent the indiscriminate acts of violence against its citizens or tourists in Israel and \nstrictly enforces security measures designed to combat and minimize the risk presented \nby terrorism. Nonetheless, the risk of terrorism and civil unrest in Israel led the U.S. \nState Department in September 2020 to raise the travel advisory for Israel to level 3 in \nSeptember 2020. \nApplicant denies that she has a close relationship with her sister in Israel \nbecause of resentment fostered in childhood. Even so, there is the relationship of other \nfamily members, such as Applicant\u2019s parents, to her sister in Israel that must be \nconsidered. Applicant is sufficiently close to her parents to participate in the weekly \nfamily video sessions that include her sister in Israel. Family trips to Europe in 2018 and \n2019 included her sister living in Israel. Maintaining her current relationship with her \nsister makes her mother happy, and Applicant sees no reason to cease her participation \nin the family sessions.

The contacts appear to have been out of \nfriendship and shared interests. Yet, her friendship and communications with an officer \nin the IDF\u2019s intelligence service could conceivably be a potential source of exploitation \nor conflict with her obligation to protect U.S. classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology, whether or not he had left the IDF to pursue his master\u2019s degree. To the \nextent that AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are implicated because of her contacts with the IDF \nofficer, mitigation is established by the lack of any recent communication between them, \nand Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that they \u201cgrew apart.\u201d Four mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 8 apply in whole or in part with respect to her ties and communications with \nthe IDF intelligence officer. They are: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nIt is difficult to see how Applicant could be pressured or coerced to assist an IDF \nofficer with whom she has not had any contact in over a year. There is no indication that \nApplicant had developed any loyalty to Israel or to this foreign intelligence officer. Her \nmonthly communication with him reflects a casual relationship, and Applicant disclosed \nher contacts with him on her SF 86 forms completed in March 2017 and August 2019. \nThere is nothing about Applicant\u2019s older sister\u2019s duties as a medical writer for a \ntechnology company that increase the likelihood Applicant will be placed in a position of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhaving to choose between the interests of her sister and the interests of the United \nStates. However, the sibling relationship and the risk of terrorism in Israel make it \ndifficult to apply either AG \u00b6 8(a) or AG \u00b6 8(c) in mitigation of the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns raised by her sister\u2019s residency and citizenship in Israel. Applicant \nwants to make her mother happy by maintaining contact with her sister in Israel. In \nforeign influence cases, it must be acknowledged that people act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a family member. As stated by the \nDOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication \nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an \nacknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices \nthat could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d Moreover, in \nevaluating Guideline B concerns, the Appeal Board has held that: \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still \npose a security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that \nan applicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to \nclassified information. Even good people can pose a security risk because \nof facts and circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. \n01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \nApplicant has no control over her sister\u2019s decision to move to Israel and acquire \ndual citizenship. In evaluating whether Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States\u201d to trigger AG \u00b6 8(b) in mitigation, it is \nnoted that Applicant has not exhibited or expressed any desire or intent to move to \nIsrael. Applicant has not been to Israel since the Birthright trip, which occurred before \nshe started working for a defense contractor. She has no current intent to travel to Israel \nin the future. Raised and educated in the United States, she has chosen to pursue her \ncareer here as an engineer contributing to the U.S. defense effort. She is not likely to \njeopardize her parents and younger sister, who are U.S. resident citizens, or her career \nin the United States by succumbing to any undue foreign influence or pressure that may \nbe exerted through the family relationship. Applicant\u2019s clear preference for her life in the \nUnited States weighs favorably in assessing whether she can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest for the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant cannot control the actions of the Israeli government or of foreign actors \nthat may seek to obtain classified or sensitive information from her by pressuring her \nsister. However, she can control her response. Applicant has demonstrated \ntrustworthiness and reliability by reporting her foreign contacts on her security clearance \napplications and by not continuing to maintain a relationship with a foreign military \nofficer which could present a potential conflict with her security obligations. After \nconsidering the evidence of record, I am persuaded that Applicant can be counted on to \nfulfill her security obligations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and amended SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 44 years old. He has earned some college credits, but not a degree. He was married from 1997 to 2004 and has two grown children from the marriage. He remarried in 2014 and has three grown stepchildren. His wife is employed by the state. Applicant was an independent contractor working for different federal agencies from 2012 to 2018. In 2018, he began working as a salaried employee for a federal contractor. (Tr. 24-31, 72) Applicant testified that in 2012 he was self-employed as an independent contractor. He was aware that he was responsible for having sufficient funds to pay his tax obligations at the end of the year. He had become accustomed to having his taxes withheld from his pay when he was a salaried employee. He stated he repeatedly fell behind in addressing his tax issues because he prioritized paying other bills and then did not have sufficient money to pay tax debts. In 2014, 2015, and 2016 he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns. Applicant testified that he requested extensions to file his federal tax returns for those years, but failed to timely file the federal tax returns after the extensions expired. IRS documents reflect the returns for these tax years were filed in December 2017. (Tr. 31-34, 38; 53-54, 73-76, 83-86; GE ",

There were no objections and the \nexhibits were admitted into evidence. Hearing Exhibits I, II, and III are administrative \ndocuments. The record was held open until March 9, 2021, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional documents. He provided AE J through R that were admitted without objection, \nand the record closed. (Applicant made letter notations on his post-hearing exhibits. They \nwere changed so the exhibits would be sequential.) DOHA received the hearing transcript \non March 8, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and amended SOR. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He has earned some college credits, but not a degree. \nHe was married from 1997 to 2004 and has two grown children from the marriage. He \nremarried in 2014 and has three grown stepchildren. His wife is employed by the state. \nApplicant was an independent contractor working for different federal agencies from 2012 \nto 2018. In 2018, he began working as a salaried employee for a federal contractor. (Tr. \n24-31, 72) \nApplicant testified that in 2012 he was self-employed as an independent \ncontractor. He was aware that he was responsible for having sufficient funds to pay his \ntax obligations at the end of the year. He had become accustomed to having his taxes \nwithheld from his pay when he was a salaried employee. He stated he repeatedly fell \nbehind in addressing his tax issues because he prioritized paying other bills and then did \nnot have sufficient money to pay tax debts. In 2014, 2015, and 2016 he failed to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns. Applicant testified that he requested extensions to file \nhis federal tax returns for those years, but failed to timely file the federal tax returns after \nthe extensions expired. IRS documents reflect the returns for these tax years were filed \nin December 2017. (Tr. 31-34, 38; 53-54, 73-76, 83-86; GE 5) \nApplicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a-\n$37,469); 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b - $37,260); 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c - $38,626); and 2017 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d - $24,989). He also failed to pay his state income tax in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.e - $7,646); \n2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.f - $6,823); 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.g - $6,621); and 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.h - $5,786). \nIn addition, a tax lien was entered against him by his state in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.i-$1,463). A \nfederal tax lien was entered against him in 2018 in the amount of $129,005.  (GE 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant stated that he requested an installment agreement with the IRS around \n2014 and was consistently paying $300 a month for a period of time. His IRS transcript \nfor tax year 2012 reflects he had an installment agreement with the IRS for unpaid 2012 \nincome taxes. He made payments of $200 a month from August 2013 until July 2014 and \nthen stopped the payments. He stated in 2014 his grandmother became sick for about six \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmonths and he prioritized other bills. The transcript also reflects payments made from \nApril 2020 through August 2020 that were collected through garnishment of his wages \nand applied to the 2012 tax year debt. The transcript reflects that as of February 2021 he \nhas a balance owed of $3,306 for tax year 2012. (Tr. 39-47, 56-61, 90; GE 5; AE L) \nThe IRS transcript for tax year 2013 reflects he had an installment agreement, \nwhich began in June 2014 and he made payments of $400 until March 2018. He missed \nfive payments during this time period. Applicant provided an email from October 2019 \nindicating he was being assisted by a professional tax service to make an Offer in \nCompromise (OIC) to the IRS. An OIC was made to the IRS in April 2018 and was denied \nin September 2018. Applicant said he was offered an installment agreement, but the IRS \nnotice was sent to an address where he no longer lived, so he missed the deadline. By \nthe time he became aware of the installment agreement offer, it was no longer valid. A \nfederal lien was then filed. He withdrew from the tax service he was using. He said he \nthen worked on getting another installment agreement. The balance owed for tax year \n2013 as of February 2021 is $4,960. (Tr. 39-47, 56-61, 88-98; GE 5; AE M) \nA September 2019 IRS transcript for tax year 2014 reflects Applicant made a \npayment of $400 in January 2015. A September 2019 IRS transcript for tax year 2017 \nreflects a payment of $2,000 in April 2019; $500 in May 2019; and $500 in June 2019. No \nother payments are reflected in these documents. Applicant provided a pay history from \nhis employment from March 2020 through February 2021 which shows his wages are \nbeing garnished because of the tax lien. (Tr. 39-47, 56-61, 90; GE 5; AE J, M, N) \nApplicant provided IRS correspondence documents. A March 2020 letter from the \nIRS notes an inquiry by Applicant about his 2012 income taxes. The IRS advised him that \nit was still processing all of his information and a response was forthcoming in 90 days. \nAnother IRS letter to Applicant from October 2020 addresses his 2012 taxes with another \n90-day response delay. A February 2021 IRS letter addresses tax years 2012 through \n2018. It noted it had received Applicant\u2019s correspondence from January 2020 and his \nrequest for an installment agreement. The IRS established an installment agreement for \nthe tax years 2012 through 2018 that was scheduled to begin in March 2021 with monthly \npayments of $2,100. Post-hearing, Applicant provided a credit card receipt with a \npayment of $2,201 on his installment agreement. (Tr. 39-47, 107-109; AE A, B, C, P) \n(Delinquent taxes for tax year 2012, 2013 and 2018 were not alleged and will not be \nconsidered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility \ndetermination, in mitigation, and in a whole-person analysis.) \nApplicant testified that he had an installment agreement to pay his state income \ntax debt. He provided a copy of the payment agreement from April 2019, which required \nhim to pay $770 a month beginning in May 2019. His balance at the time was $24,513. \nPrior to then he had made six payments in 2017 (five were for $298 and one was $595); \nfive payments in 2018 (four for $818 and one for $1,634). In May 2019, he began making \ninstallment agreement payments of $770. He made consistent monthly payments from \nMay 2019 until October 2019. He missed the November 2019 payment, but made \nDecember 2019 to February 2020, when he stopped the payments. Applicant testified \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he stopped his monthly installment payments to the state because the IRS began \ngarnishing his wages in February 2020 due to the federal tax lien. (Tr. 39, 47-50, 98-101; \nAE D, E, F) \nApplicant sent a letter to his state tax authority in April 2020 advising it that because \nhis wages were garnished, he was unable to make his installment agreement payments. \nThe state advised him that it was able to cancel his current payment arrangement \u201cand \nplace your case on hold through 6/20/2020 due to your financial hardship resulting from \nthe COVID-19 health crisis.\u201d (AE D). He was advised the extension would expire in July \n2020 and reset. In September 2020, he was advised that the hold on his payment plan \nhad been extended and would reset in October 2020 with resumption of payments due \nsometime in November 2020. As of October 2019 Applicant\u2019s balance owed for his state \ntax liability was $20,766. No payments have been made on that balance since February \n2020. Applicant stated he was waiting for the state to advise him about the payment \nagreement restarting. Due to the pandemic it has been difficult to make contact with the \nstate tax authority. Post-hearing, Applicant advised that payments would be reinstated in \nApril 2021. He provided a copy of his tax balances owed for tax year 2015 ($2,489); 2016 \n($8498); 2017 ($7,764) and 2018 ($1,698). The cumulative balance owed to his state is \n$20,450. (Tr. 101-107; GE 5; AE D, E, F, G, Q). \nApplicant has no savings and less than $100 in his bank account. He has no \ninvestments. He has three credit cards on which he makes minimum monthly payments. \nHe keeps a budget on a spreadsheet. He obtained a $25,000 debt consolidation loan in \nJanuary 2021 that has monthly payments of $790; a credit union line of credit for $15,000 \nwith $295 monthly payments; a private lender loan for $5,600 with payments of $564 a \nmonth; and another private lender loan he obtained in October 2019 of $6,000 that he \nused to pay taxes owed for that year. The monthly payments are $200 and the current \nbalance is about $4,000. He testified that his annual salary is approximately $109,000. \nHis wife earns about $68,000. He thought she may have a credit card that is delinquent. \nIn his February 2018 security clearance application, he noted that he took a vacation trip \nto the Dominican Republic and another in 2017 to Jamaica. He said he used an \ninheritance to pay for the 2017 trip. Applicant explained that he intends to meet the terms \nof the installment agreements by getting a part-time job in the future. (Tr. 53, 66-70, 77-\n83, 113; AE O) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns. He \nfailed to pay his federal and state income taxes for 2014 through 2017 as required. He \nhas an unresolved 2013 state tax lien. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues began when he became self-employed as an independent \ncontractor in 2012. He had been accustomed to having his taxes withheld from his pay. \nHe was aware of the problem in 2012, but each year he failed to address it and his \nindebtedness continued to increase. He failed to timely file his 2014, 2015, and 2016 \nfederal tax returns. Applicant made some payments through IRS installment agreements \nand an attempt to negotiate an OIC with the IRS, which was denied. He also had an \ninstallment agreement with his state tax authority. He failed to comply with the state \ninstallment agreement because the IRS issued a federal tax lien and began garnishing \nhis wages. \nApplicant\u2019s initial failure to plan for payment of his taxes when he became self-\nemployed may be understandable. However, each year he repeated his conduct and \nfailed to pay his federal and state income taxes, thereby accumulating large tax debts. \nHis repeated and ongoing conduct raises issues about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Under the circumstances, I cannot conclude that similar tax problems are \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20a) does not apply. \nAs mentioned above, perhaps the first year Applicant was an independent \ncontractor might be excused for his failure to timely pay his tax debt, but he repeated his \nactions for several years and became deeper in debt. I cannot find that the financial \nproblems were beyond his control or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence he has received financial counseling. There is evidence that \nApplicant has an installment agreement with the IRS and had a payment plan with the \nstate tax authority. However, he stopped making payments to the state in February 2020 \nwhen his wages were garnished. He recently made his first payment on the federal \ninstallment agreement. Applicant does not have a reliable track record of adhering to an \ninstallment agreement and consistent payments to satisfy his tax obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant made an arrangement with the IRS to pay his delinquent taxes. Post-\nhearing he provided proof of his first payment. As noted above, he has not yet established \na solid record of adhering to his current agreement. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to the extent that \nhe has an installment agreement with the IRS, but it is too early to determine if he will \nmake consistent payments. He had a payment plan with his state tax authority, but \nstopped it because his wages were garnished. He is no longer in compliance with this \nagreement. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply to his state tax debt. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant neglected to file his federal income taxes for several years and also failed \nto pay his federal income taxes for those years. Despite being aware that he had an \nobligation to plan for his tax liability, he repeatedly failed to do so and a federal tax lien \nwas entered in 2018 for $129,000. He has made little progress on decreasing that liability. \nHe also failed to pay his state income taxes for several years. He had a payment \nagreement with the state, but stopped payments when his wages were garnished. The \nDOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

June \n29, 2016.))   \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \nfile and pay his federal income taxes and pay his state income taxes raises serious \nconcerns. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s SOR \nadmissions and those at his hearing are incorporated as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2004, and received an associate\u2019s degree in computer systems in 2008. \nHe has never been married. He has a four-year-old daughter and he shares custody \nwith her mother. His grandmother also lives with him. (Tr. 37-38) \nApplicant has been working for his current employer, a federal contractor and \nclearance sponsor, since October 2018. He submitted his first SCA in November 2018, \nand was granted interim eligibility for access to top-secret information in January 2019. \nIn his responses to Question 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2018 \nSCA, Applicant denied any illegal use, purchase, receiving, or handling of drugs or \ncontrolled substances in the last seven years. (GE 1) On January 8, 2019, Applicant \nwas interviewed by a background investigator from the Office of Personal Management \n(OPM). During the interview, he disclosed having financial issues, driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) in 2011 and 2015, and that he was terminated from a job in August \n2018. He deliberately failed to disclose his illegal use, purchase, receiving, or handling \nof drugs or controlled substances (marijuana) in the last seven years. (GE 3) \nOn April 8, 2019, Applicant was re-interviewed and confronted with a 2016 \npositive test result for marijuana use while he was attending court-mandated alcohol \ntreatment following his 2015 DUI conviction. Applicant was on probation between \nJanuary 2016 and January 2018, and he was required to attend alcohol treatment.

He initially claimed he used marijuana only about six \ntimes for experimental purposes. \nDuring the April 9, 2019 interview, Applicant also disclosed that he began using \nmedical marijuana in 2017, when it became legal in his home state. (The state\u2019s Medical \nCannabis Commission (SMCC) became operational and sales began in December \n2017). He claimed he has not used any illegal drugs in the last seven years because he \npurchases the marijuana through a valid state prescription. (GE 3) Applicant submitted \na certification from the SMCC indicating that he is a qualified patient for the period of \nSeptember 29, 2020, through September 29, 2021. (AE 2) Applicant explained that he \ndid not disclose his marijuana use in his 2018 SCA because he obtained the marijuana \nlegally. \nApplicant uses marijuana every other day, as needed, to help him sleep, to \ncontrol his anxiety, depression, and for his self-care and mental health, which is \nextremely important to him. He obtained and used marijuana after he was granted an \ninterim top-secret clearance in January 2019. Applicant told the investigator that he was \naware that the use of marijuana is against federal law, but he believes that it does not \nmake any sense for him not to use marijuana if it\u2019s allowed under state law. He told the \ninterviewer that his most recent use of medical marijuana was in April 2019. (GE 3) \nApplicant noted that he has been using marijuana legally and sees a doctor to \nremain compliant with his state laws. He claimed his \u201cmedicine\u201d is only for use outside \nof work. He does not believe the Federal government should exclude people who are \ngetting treatment from being able to work for the Government. He stated that if he is to \nbe judged, his on-the-job performance should be what defines him. (Tr. 37) \nApplicant believes that he is a good, caring person, and a loving father. He has \novercome adversity in his life and, like many, has mental health struggles that should \nnot define him. He believes that there are a lot of people out there that need the same \ntreatment. He believes the Federal government is discriminating against him and others \nbecause of his mental health issues. \nApplicant has worked in Information Technology (IT) or on computers \nprofessionally for over 13 years. He had not been able to get a job in his geographical \narea because he did not possess a security clearance. In October 2018, his dream \nbecame a reality when he was hired for his current job, which is within four miles of his \nhome. Before that, he was commuting as far as 50 miles each way, or had jobs that \nrequired him to travel. He loves his current job and his coworkers. He believes that he is \ndoing a great job for his employer and customers. He would like to continue working for \nhis employer. \nAt hearing, Applicant expanded on the statements he made to the investigator in \n2019. He testified that he has been using marijuana on and off (or every once in a while \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2013 or monthly) with friends since high school (2004), to present. He also purchases or \nobtains marijuana from friends on a monthly basis. (Tr. 48 - 52) He has stopped using \nmarijuana a few times, but the only occasions he remembered doing so were both while \nattending alcohol treatment classes after his 2011 and 2015 DUIs. He used marijuana \nabout seven times in between the end of the alcohol treatment classes and before he \nreceived his state MCC certification in 2017. (Tr. 54 \u2013 55) He admitted that he used \nmarijuana during the seven-year period before he submitted his November 2018 SCA. \nHe told the Government interviewer that he intended to continue using marijuana in the \nfuture. At hearing, he was evasive and failed to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue using marijuana. \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after he was granted an interim top-secret \nclearance in January 2019. He believed it was okay for him to do so because it is legal \nfor him to use marijuana under state law. At hearing he stated: \u201cIf I can't have a \nclearance because of that, then I will take my mental health\u201d. Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence to show that he sought or received any medical or psychological \ntreatment or counseling for substance abuse, other than the alcohol treatment he \nreceived after his DUIs in 2011 and 2015. Applicant used marijuana the day before his \nhearing. (Tr. 63 - 65) \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nIn reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following: \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence Memorandum \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, made it clear that state laws do \nnot authorize citizens to violate federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug.  \nChanges to state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, effective June 8 2017). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant \nin national security determinations. The adjudicative authority must determine if the use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, 50\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3343 (2008), specifically prohibits a federal agency from granting or renewing \na clearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict, and under\nfederal law, use of marijuana remains unlawful. (See, SEAD 4, App. B) \n \n \nExecutive Order 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace (25 September 1985) \nmandates a drug-free workplace and drug-free federal workforce, and expressly states \nthat use of illegal drugs on or off duty by federal employees in positions with access to \nsensitive information may pose a serious risk to national security and is inconsistent \nwith the trust placed in such employees as servants of the public. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nApplicant has used marijuana on and off since he was in high school in 2004 to \nat least February 4, 2021. Between January 2019 and April 2019, Applicant purchased \nand used marijuana while possessing a top-secret clearance granted on January 2019. \nHe acknowledged knowing that the use of marijuana was illegal under federal law, and \nthat the Government has a policy against security clearance holders using illegal drugs. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions. Considering the \nevidence as a whole, only mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment,\u201d is partially applicable to this case, but it does not mitigate the concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance\nof a securit\n \ny clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th\nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The\nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in\nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nAs stated above, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long \nhistory of illegal marijuana purchase, possession, and use spanning from high school \n(2004) to the day before his hearing in February 2021. Applicant illegally used \nmarijuana between January 2019 and April 2019, while possessing a top-secret \nclearance. He knew that the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, and that the \nFederal Government has a policy against people holding a clearance and using illegal \ndrugs. \nApplicant\u2019s purchase, possession, and use of marijuana cast doubts on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations, and suitability to hold a clearance, especially because his \nsubstance misuse occurred while he possessed a clearance. He was aware of the \nFederal Government\u2019s policy against illegal drug use, and the adverse security \nconsequences for such use. Nevertheless, he was unwilling to stop using marijuana. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose in his November 2018 SCA that he used \nmarijuana on and off since high school until at least November 2018. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness . . . .\u201d \nOnly two personal conduct mitigating conditions are partially raised by the facts: \nAG \u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant denied that he falsified his 2018 SCA, because he was not using \nmarijuana illegally. He argued that as a certified marijuana user under the state MCC, \nhe is legally allowed by the state to purchase and use marijuana. \nEven if I was to consider Applicant\u2019s argument valid (which I do not), the facts \nshow that he falsified his 2018 SCA. Applicant\u2019s state MCC started functioning in \nDecember 2017. Thus, any marijuana use before December 2017 was illegal under \nstate law and federal law. Applicant admitted he used marijuana on and off between \n2011 and 2018. Applicant\u2019s 2018 SCA required him to disclose any use of illegal drugs \nduring the seven years preceding his 2018 SCA. He deliberately failed to disclose his \nuse of marijuana between at least 2011 and December 2017 on his 2018 SCA. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) therefore applies. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony demonstrates that he was less than \ncandid when he submitted his 2018 SCA responses, and that he deliberately misled or \nmade false statements to the government investigator about the full extent and \ncircumstances surrounding his purchase and use of marijuana. Therefore, AG \u00b6 17(a) \ndoes not apply. Applicant intends to continue purchasing and using marijuana in the \nfuture through the state\u2019s MCC. Therefore, the offense is likely to recur and his criminal \nbehavior continues to cast serious doubts on Applicant\u2019s judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis.

He was hired in \n2018, and was granted eligibility for access to top-secret information between January \n2019 and April 2019. Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with \nfederal rules and regulations continue to raise serious questions about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. He \nintends to continue his use of marijuana in the future. The drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. Moreover, he falsified his 2018 \nSCA. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. He graduated from high school in 2007 and attended university from September 2007 to May 2011, when he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant is unmarried. He was previously denied a security clearance in 2010 by the U.S. Department of State based on drug involvement, however he was granted a DOD security clearance and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) eligibility in 2011 while working for a defense contractor. He was denied SCI eligibility by another government agency in 2017 for illegal drug use, involvement with prostitution, and falsifying a SCA.

The case was assigned to me on July 6, 2021. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11 are admitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 32-year-old senior consultant, employed by a government contractor \nsince October 2014. He previously worked for another government contractor from July \n2011 to September 2014. Applicant was born in 1989 in China, and entered the United \nStates in 1992. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. He graduated from high \nschool in 2007 and attended university from September 2007 to May 2011, when he was \nawarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant is unmarried. He was previously denied a \nsecurity clearance in 2010 by the U.S. Department of State based on drug involvement, \nhowever he was granted a DOD security clearance and sensitive compartmented \ninformation (SCI) eligibility in 2011 while working for a defense contractor. He was denied \nSCI eligibility by another government agency in 2017 for illegal drug use, involvement \nwith prostitution, and falsifying a SCA. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used marijuana \nfrom June 2008 to June 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and from October 2015 to December 2015 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he attempted to grow marijuana in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); used cocaine from \nOctober 2015 to December 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and Applicant\u2019s 2015 drug involvement \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.d) occurred after being granted a DOD security clearance in 2011 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e). \nThe SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant falsified his 2011 SCA by \nfailing to report his purchases and use of marijuana as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, above. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b) SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges Applicant twice engaged with a prostitute in November \n2015. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f allege Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his drug use, \npurchases, attempt to grow marijuana, and use while holding a security clearance in his \nMay 2016 SCA. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g, 2.h, and 2.i allege Applicant failed to disclose his drug use, \nincluding while holding a clearance, his purchases, and attempts to grow marijuana on \nhis August 2016 SCA. Finally, SOR \u00b6 2.j alleges that Applicant failed to disclose drug use, \nother than while in college in 2009 (under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d), in his personal \nsubject interview with a DOD investigator on May 14, 2018. Applicant admitted all of the \nSOR allegations with explanations. \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana from June 2008 to June 2010 while in \ncollege, and from October 2015 to December 2015. He admitted to purchasing marijuana, \nand using marijuana and cocaine at various times from October 2015 to December 2015, \nand attempted to grow marijuana in 2015. He also admitted to twice engaging a prostitute \nin Hong Kong while visiting in 2015.

In his 2011 SCA, Applicant noted \nthat he was investigated in 2010 for a secret security clearance, but was denied by the \nDepartment of State because they were \u201cunhappy with my use of marijuana and did not \nbelieve I have stopped for good. I have learned my lesson from this experience and regret \never using marijuana. I have not smoked for over half a year now and don\u2019t plan on \nsmoking again.\u201d (Item 4) Despite the disclosure in his 2011 SCA about being denied a \nsecurity clearance due to drug involvement, he denied any involvement with illegal drugs \nin the preceding seven years, including while holding a security clearance. \nFrom July 2011 to September 2014, Applicant worked for a company he listed in \nhis 2016 SCA as a government contractor (Item 5) Applicant asserted that he first learned \nin 2013 that he was previously granted a security clearance in 2011. A Joint Personnel \nAdjudication System (JPAS) entry for Applicant shows that the Department of Navy CAF \ngranted Applicant eligibility for access to SCI in May 2011. (Item 10) In October 2014, \nApplicant began working for his current employer and clearance sponsor. (Item 5) In \nMarch 2015, Applicant signed a Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement. (Item \n11) \nApplicant completed two additional SCAs in May and August 2016. In both, he \ndenied previous involvement with illegal drugs, including while holding a security \nclearance, but he did note that he was denied a clearance in 2011 \u201cdue to experimental \nmarijuana use in college.\u201d (Items 5, 6) In October 2016, Applicant was interviewed for a \npolygraph examination by another government agency. During the pre-test interview, he \nadmitted his past drug use and involvement with prostitution as alleged in the SOR. (Item \n7) In January 2017, that agency denied him eligibility for access to SCI. \n \nOn May 14, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator. He \nfailed at that time to fully disclose his drug use history, other than while in college. In July \n2019, Applicant was again interviewed by a Government investigator in an enhanced \nsubject interview. In this interview, he disclosed his use of marijuana in 2014 to 2015 in \nsocial settings with friends. He stated that he believed at the time, that his clearance was \n\u201cnot active\u201d since he was not working on government projects that required a clearance. \nHe also stated that smoking marijuana was not illegal, as it is legal in the city in which he \nlived at the time, and where he currently lives. He also acknowledged using cocaine two \nto three times from 2014 to 2015, but admitted after being confronted, that he used \ncocaine three-to-four times. He also acknowledged using marijuana from 2007 to 2010, \nand purchasing it from 2009 to 2010. Applicant claimed that he did not report his drug \ninvolvement in three SCAs due to being influenced by a Navy job recruiter not to admit to \ndrug use because it is viewed unfavorably. He followed that advice during subsequent \nsecurity applications. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted, \u201c[p]lease accept this letter as my \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement, substance misuse, illegal \nsexual behavior, and any other personal conduct involving questionable judgment and \ndishonesty\u201d with the understanding that future infractions would serve as grounds for \nrevocation of his clearance.

When he went to the 2016 interview, he says that \nhe was already a \u201cchanged man.\u201d He considers his activities in 2015 to be \u201cisolated \nevents\u201d that will not be repeated. (Ans.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.

Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24:   \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used and purchased illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. He \nalso tried to grow marijuana, and indicated in his 2011 SCA that he did not intend to \ncontinue using marijuana, however he used it again in 2015. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (f) \napply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions, and find the following conditions as \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has a history of drug use while in college that continued until 2015 after \nusing marijuana and cocaine at social gatherings. He knew by at least 2013, that he had \na security clearance, and had been working for a defense contractor since 2011. \nApplicant noted in his 2011 SCA that he would abstain from further marijuana use, but he \nfailed to follow through on that statement of intent. In November 2020, he again stated \nhis intent to abstain from any involvement with illegal drugs with the understanding that \nfuture infractions would serve as grounds for revocation of a clearance. However, based \non his past behavior, his renewed promises ring hollow. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s broken promises in the past and history of illegal drug use, \npurchase, and cultivation while employed by a defense contractor and holding a security \nclearance, I am not convinced of his recent attestations of change. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem or persuaded me that his \nexpressed abstinence is truthful given his relapse history. He has also not indicated that \nhe has disassociated from drug-using associates and contacts and changed the \nenvironment where drug use has occurred in the past. These are mitigating elements of \nAG \u00b6 26(b) that have not been satisfied. Although he may be sincere about being a \nchanged man, he has not supplied sufficient or persuasive evidence of such changed \nbehavior or that he has finally refrained from illegal drug involvement once and for all. AG \n\u00b6 26(a) is not fully satisfied. There is no indication in the record that Applicant has \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceived drug abuse counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s past behavior and history of involvement with illegal drugs, including \nwith a security clearance, continue to reflect poorly on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. No mitigating condition is fully applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or\nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,\nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved\nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility\ndetermination, or other official government representative;\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n  (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that\ncountry; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal there,\nis illegal in the United States; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant falsified his 2011 SCA by failing to report his purchases and use of \nmarijuana. He also failed to disclose on his May 2016 SCA, his drug use, purchases, and \nattempts to grow marijuana in 2014 or 2015, including while holding a security clearance. \nIn his August 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose his drug use, including while holding a \nclearance, his purchases, and attempts to grow marijuana; and he failed to fully disclose \nhis drug use, other than while in college, during his personal subject interview with a DOD \ninvestigator on May 14, 2018. Finally, Applicant twice engaged with a prostitute in 2015, \nin a foreign country. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), (b), (e), and (g) apply. \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant failed to fully disclose his drug \nactivity in his SCAs as noted above. Despite noting that he was denied a clearance in \n2010 by the Department of State due to drug involvement, his failure to fully disclose his \ndrug involvement shows an intentional attempt to obfuscate or minimize his conduct. The \nevidence shows that Applicant clearly was aware of his clearance status by at least 2013, \nbut failed to disclose his drug involvement while holding a security clearance. He later \nnoted in his enhanced personal subject interview that he believed that his clearance was \nnot active; however, there is no record evidence from his employer supporting that \ncontention. \nI am convinced that Applicants omissions, concealments, and falsifications of \nrelevant facts from his SCAs were intentional. Additionally, his engagement with illegal \nprostitution in 2015 evidences personal conduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s repeated failures to \ndisclose his drug involvement on his SCAs. In his SOR Answer, Applicant takes \nresponsibility for his conduct and noted that he is a changed man. His past admissions \ncame during a pre-polygraph test interview or after he finally disclosed his conduct and \nneeded a security clearance. I reject his reasoning for falsifying his SCA, as a recruiter\u2019s \nadvice should not influence one to make subsequent years of false statements. I am not \nsatisfied that sufficient time has passed or that Applicant has provided substantial and \nconvincing evidence that this conduct will not recur. His past behavior continues to cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Accordingly, I \nconclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant or continue eligibility for access \nto classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant \ndivorced in 1992. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1992. In 1993, she remarried a \ncitizen of Saudi Arabia in the United States. They had a child born in the United States in \n1996. Her son is a dual citizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia. Applicant lived in \nSaudi Arabia with her husband from approximately 1995 to 2017. They separated in 2017 \nand divorced in July 2020. Her son from this marriage lives with her in the United States. \n(Tr. 23-30, 61-62) \nApplicant testified that her first husband was physically, sexually, and emotionally \nabusive. In 1984, he tried to kill her in front of their son. She escaped and a friend notified \nher that her husband hired a hitman to kill her. She filed a police report. She moved to a \ndifferent city and filed for divorce. He found her in the new city. He convinced her to let \nhim see their son. He kidnapped the child and told her if she wanted to see the child, she \nhad to return to his house and beg for forgiveness. She agreed and was physically and \nsexually abused. She fled again. She was waiting for the divorce to be finalized and she \nwas confident she would get full custody of her son. The weekend before the proceedings, \nher husband kidnapped the son and fled to Afghanistan. Applicant reported the abduction \nto the FBI, but because a custody determination had not been entered, there was nothing \nthey could do. Her husband also had a nephew that lived in the United States who \nthreatened to kill her. (Tr. 23-35, 62-64; GE 3) \nApplicant stated that she sent relatives to Afghanistan to find her son. They were \nbeaten and threated with death by the husband. Applicant sent a letter to the President \nof Afghanistan about the abduction.

Applicant testified she did \nnot have contact with her son for 17 years. Applicant wrote a book about her years trying \nto find her son. (Tr. 35-44) \nApplicant became aware that her ex-husband held a Deputy Minister position in \nthe Afghan government sometime after 2001. When the son learned his mother was alive, \nhe confronted his father and was told that his mother had divorced him and sold the son. \nHe ran away from his father and contacted his mother asking to live with her. They \nreunited in September 2003 in Pakistan. Applicant told her current husband that she had \nfound her first son. The son went to Saudi Arabia where Applicant was living at the time. \n(Tr. 38-44) \nAfter his arrival in Saudi Arabia, Applicant\u2019s older son was abusive to his younger \nhalf-brother and to her. He choked his brother. He told Applicant that he wanted to kill \nher. He assaulted Applicant. He became more aggressive. Applicant took him to a doctor. \nAfter talking to his father on the telephone, the son again told his mother that he wanted \nto kill her and slice her with a knife. His reason was because divorce is not recognized in \nhis culture, and she had divorced his father. In addition to threatening to kill Applicant, he \ntold her was going to rape her and kill her younger son. In 2004, she bought him a plane \nticket to leave the Saudi Arabia, which he did. In her November 2017 interview with a \ngovernment investigator, she stated that since her son left in 2004, he will randomly \ncontact her and either ask for forgiveness or threaten to kill and rape her. (Tr. 35-45; AE \nE) \nApplicant\u2019s eldest son married in 2005. At some point he was living in the United \nStates. He contacted Applicant in Saudi Arabia, cried and apologized for his conduct. He \ntold her he wanted to see her. Applicant talked with his wife and learned he had applied \nto be a linguist with the U.S. government. He had passed the initial screening and was in \ntraining in Georgia. Her son left the training and returned to Afghanistan in 2009. Applicant \ntraveled to the United States for a visit, but it is unknown if at the time she traveled, she \nthought she would be visiting her son and his family or if she was aware he had already \nleft for Afghanistan. His wife told Applicant that he abandoned her and the two children. \nShe told Applicant that her son had knives in the house and was planning to kill Applicant \nwhen she visited. Applicant testified she does not know where her grandchildren or their \nmother live. She has had no further contact. (Tr. 45-48, 71-73) \nApplicant\u2019s oldest son now lives in Afghanistan. In 2016, he contacted Applicant. \nHe told her he remarried and has a son. He told Applicant to send him money as a \ncondition for him to talk to her. She did not. She testified that he just wanted to talk. He \nwanted to know about Applicant\u2019s family and he threatened her. (Tr. 48-51, 57-58, 60-66, \n73) \nApplicant testified that her ex-husband has lots of strong connections and is a \n\u201cplayer.\u201d He has worked for the Afghan government and also with the \u201cRed Army\u201d when \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nit was in Afghanistan.

She testified that her son told her if she returned to \nAfghanistan he will kill her. She also said her ex-husband told her if she returned to \nAfghanistan she would be killed and he would send her body parts back to the United \nStates. Applicant testified that she worked for the U.S. government as a linguist in \nAfghanistan from March 2018 to February 2020. She testified that her ex-husband and \nson were unaware that she was in Afghanistan, and she had no contact with them. (Tr. \n48-51, 57-58, 60-66) \nApplicant completed a Counterintelligence Focused Security Screening \nQuestionnaire (CFSSQ) in October 2017. In it she disclosed that her first husband is a \ncurrent member of the Taliban in Afghanistan and has been since 1988. She disclosed \nthat she maintained annual contact with her eldest son in Afghanistan through Facebook \nand \u201cWhatsApp.\u201d Her last contact was in June 2017. In the section of the Questionnaire \nrequesting disclosure of any contacts with ties to terrorist organizations, Applicant \ndefinitively listed her first husband as a member of the Taliban. She signed this document \n\u201cas true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.\u201d \nAt her hearing, Applicant denied the entries and explained that she said her first \nhusband was working with the Taliban, and after 9/11 he was a Deputy Minister in \nAfghanistan. She said she does not know if he is a member of the Taliban, but he works \nwith whomever is in power and is manipulative. She is sure he worked with the Taliban in \nthe past. She said he could be a member, but she did not know. She said when the \nTaliban came into power, her first husband was very powerful and was an opportunist \nplayer. She testified that he has worked with \u201cRed Army\u201d and the Afghan communist \nregime in the past. Applicant also denied she had contact with her son through \n\u201cWhatsapp\u201d as listed on her CFSSQ. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 51-\n58, 73-77; GE 2 pages 14-15, 25-27; AE D) \nApplicant testified that if her eldest son attempts to communicate with her she will \nrefuse because he is mentally unstable. She does not trust him. She does not want to put \nherself or her younger son in danger. In her November 2017 background interview, she \ntold the government investigator that she does not reach out to her eldest son, but leaves \na way for him to contact her in hopes that one day he will be different. She denied that \nshe said to the investigator that she would leave a way for her eldest son to contact her, \nand he misinterpreted her. Her older son has contacted her through Facebook messenger \nin the past. She said she unfriended him on Facebook. She confirmed that she has not \nhad contact with her first husband since 1986. (Tr. 57-59, 73-80; GE 3) \nApplicant lived with her second husband from 2004 until 2017 in Saudi Arabia. She \nis not a dual citizen. Her husband is a marketing manager.

Then she \ngot a job as a linguist and moved to Afghanistan so the divorce was delayed. When she \nreturned in March 2020, she continued the process and was granted the divorce in \nDecember 2020. (Tr. 51-52, 60, 81-89; GE 1, 3; AE B, C) \nApplicant testified that she has not spoken to her second husband since she left in \nDecember 2017. She believes her son has contact with his father approximately every \ntwo to three months, but she does not know that for certain. He last visited his father in \n2019. Applicant testified she does not maintain any Saudi friends. She does have some \nAmerican friends who are married to Saudis. Applicant\u2019s sister and cousin live in the \nUnited States and they maintain close contact. Applicant no longer has a Saudi bank \naccount. She presently owns a house in the United States that she purchased for \napproximately $182,000. Her sister helped her financially. Applicant has a pension plan \nworth about $150,000. (Tr. 51-52, 60, 89-97; GE 1, 3; AE B, C) \nA witness testified on behalf of Applicant. He is a retired Army Reserve officer and \nis working as a civilian contractor. He holds a security clearance. He has experience \nworking in the Middle East. He has known Applicant since 2013. He is aware of her \narranged marriage to her first husband, his abusive treatment, and the kidnapping of her \nson. He believes she is an honorable person. He has no concerns with her holding a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 99-107; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nApplicant and her second husband have been separated since 2017 and were \ndivorced in 2020. She has not had any contact with him since their separation. She does \nnot own any property or have any financial interests in Saudi Arabia. Insufficient evidence \nwas raised under the Guideline B, foreign influence security concerns regarding \nApplicant\u2019s second husband and any financial interests she has in Saudi Arabia. I find for \nApplicant for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nAfghanistan. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, \nthrough her eldest son and her first husband who reside in Afghanistan. Although \nApplicant claims she has no contact with her eldest son, she has a history of wanting to \nreestablish a relationship with him and leaving a way for him to contact her. Her behavior \nis that of a mother to a child, regardless of past circumstances. The above disqualifying \nconditions have been raised by the evidence as to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which \nthe persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Afghanistan through her eldest son \nand her first husband. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record are relevant. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. Although she has not had contact with her first \nhusband for many years, in 2017, she told a government investigator that he was a \nmember of the Taliban. She later testified that she did not know if he was a member, but \nasserted that he is well-connected with whomever is in power and he could be a Taliban \nmember. She said he is a \u201cplayer\u201d and an opportunist. He has held a high position in the \nAfghan government. He has threatened to kill her if she returned to Afghanistan. She \ntestified that he is a violent person. \nAfter her husband kidnapped their son the first time, she returned to him and \nendured abuse so she could see her son. He kidnapped the son a second time, and she \ntragically did not have contact with him for 17 years. She spent years trying to find him \nand wrote a book about it. Her son now works for his father in his hotel. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and statements to a government investigator, her son is also violent \nand through the years has contacted her asking for forgiveness and threatening to kill \nher. She has repeatedly resumed contact even after his violent threats. As a mother she \nis always hopeful to reestablish a relationship with her child, despite her assertions that \nshe would refuse to communicate with him. Based on her first husband\u2019s willingness to \nwork with the Taliban and those in power, and his past conduct of using their son as a \npawn, I cannot find that it is unlikely that Applicant would be placed in a position to having \nto choose between the United States and her son. I cannot find or expect a mother to \nresolve any conflict of interest against her son, regardless of their past relationship. This \nrelationship cannot be considered casual regardless of the frequency of contact. I find \nnone of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline B, \nforeign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On June 14, 2021, I notified Appellant by \nemail that his hearing would be conducted by video teleconference on June 30, 2021. \nThe email notification is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through L, \nwhich were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until July 9, 2021, to enable \nhim to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted one additional page \nto be added to AX E. The additional page was admitted without objection. \nAfter the hearing adjourned on June 30, 2021, I notified Department Counsel that \nI intended to issue a summary decision. (HX II.) On July 7, 2021, I notified Applicant that \nI intended to issue a summary decision. (HX III.) Neither party objected. \n \nThe SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts totaling about $40,344. In Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR and at the hearing, he attributed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.i to his drastic income reduction after he and his wife separated. He attributed the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.m to\n \n unexpected medical bills for his son. His son lives with him, \nbut he receives no child-support payments from his wife. He presented documentary \nevidence that he had resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d-1.m, and he was \nmaking regular payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (credit-card account \ncharged off for $25,807) and 1.c (charged-off bill for $8,184, for excess mileage on a \nleased vehicle).  \nBased on the record as a whole, I conclude that Department Counsel presented \nsufficient evidence to establish the allegations in the SOR. I also conclude that Applicant \npresented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate that facts that he admitted \nor that were proven by the evidence presented by Department Counsel. I conclude that \nsecurity concerns are mitigated under the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 20(b) (debts \ndue to conditions largely beyond his control and he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances) and \u00b6 20(d) (good-faith effort to pay or resolve debts). \nI am satisfied that Applicant\u2019s financial problems do not create doubt about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. I have weighed the evidence as a whole and have given due consideration \nto the whole-person concept. I conclude that Applicant has met his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n2 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \nfollows: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted\u201d and \u201c(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred over a span of eleven years, from the age \nof 14, when he began dealing drugs, to 2000. He was convicted of serious crimes in \n1993 and 2000. As of the date of the hearing, he remained on parole until 2030. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(b) and 31(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing \nthe conduct underlying his criminal convictions. His guilty pleas and his admissions in \nhis Answer constitute evidence that he engaged in the conduct that led to his criminal \nconvictions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) are not established. \nI commend Applicant\u2019s involvement with his community as a mentor to youth and \nformerly incarcerated individuals, his college attendance, and his favorable employment \nrecord with his current employer since 2017. However, his criminal conduct spanned a \nperiod of eleven years, he was paroled only in 2014, and he remains on parole until \n2030. As such, I find that not enough time has elapsed since his criminal behavior and \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, and the record evidence still casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He \nresponded to the FORM on October 16, 2020, and the case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 25, 2021.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \nwith explanations, and he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g.

Although she intends to apply for a U.S. \nvisa, Applicant stated in his SCA that it will be \u201csome years from now.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s wife works as a freelance translator and is not associated with any \nUkrainian business. She has never worked for the Ukrainian government or any foreign \nintelligence entities. (Answer to SOR at 3.)

He also told the interviewer that his financial situation was \u201ca perilous one,\u201d \nbecause he was unemployed and dependent on his parents and his savings for living \nexpenses and student loan payments. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) He has improved his financial \nsituation since the screening interview by working as a freelance translator. As of October \n16, 2020, when he responded to the FORM, he had worked as a freelance translator \nsince January 2017 and been paid $5,451 since November 1, 2019; $3,032 since May 1, \n2020; $2,376 since August 1, 2020; and $1,685 since October 1, 2020.

He declined the interview because he was pursuing \nemployment with a defense contractor. (FORM Item 4 at 77.) In his response to the \nFORM, he stated that the Ukrainian company offered him an annual salary of $27,600, \nwhich he states is \u201castronomical\u201d by Ukrainian standards. He stated that he rejected the \noffer in order to accept his current position with a defense contractor, realizing that there \nwas no guarantee that he would be granted a security clearance.

Except for his wife, stepson, and in-laws, all of his Ukrainian contacts \nwere related to his service in the Peace Corps and employed by a Ukrainian state \nuniversity. As such, they were employees of the Ukrainian Minister of Education and \nScience. After learning that they raised security concerns, he has cut off contact with all \nof his Russian contacts and all but two Ukrainian contacts. (FORM Response at 6-9). One \nof these two Ukrainian contacts is now a freelance web developer and the other is a self-\nemployed illustrator. (FORM Item 4 at 44, 49.) The information about Applicant\u2019s \nUkrainian and Russian contacts is summarized in Appendix A, attached to this decision. \nHis two Ukrainian friends with whom he maintains contact are identified as AO and LK in \nAppendix A. \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s former colleagues in the Peace Corps submitted letters lauding \nhim for his loyalty, integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm, and his passionate attitude about his \nservice to the United States and the mission of the Peace Corps in Ukraine. One of his \ncolleagues was impressed by the way Applicant handled a situation reflecting the \nendemic corruption in the Ukrainian education system. Applicant and several other Peace \nCorps volunteers had offered to serve as judges in a yearly Olympiad for Ukrainian \nstudents. When Ukrainian officials refused to correct a mistake in scoring, Applicant \npulled all the Peace Corps volunteers out of judging the competition and did so in a way \nthat did not damage the relations between the Peace Corps and the Ukrainian Ministry of \nEducation and Science. (Attachments to FORM Response.) \nAt the request of Department Counsel and without objection by Applicant, I have \ntaken administrative notice of relevant facts about Ukraine. I also have taken \nadministrative notice on my own motion, without objection from either party, of the facts \nset out in the U.S. Department of State document, \u201cU.S. Relations with Ukraine, Bilateral \nRelations Fact Sheet, dated December 18, 2020 (www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with\u00ad\nukraine). The facts administratively noticed are set out below. \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with Ukraine in 1991, following \nits independence from the Soviet Union. The United States attaches great importance to \nthe success of Ukraine as a free and democratic state with a flourishing market economy. \nThe U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership highlights the importance of the \nbilateral relationship and continue commitment of the United States to support enhanced \nengagement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Ukraine. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUkraine has had a parliamentary-presidential type of government since becoming \nindependent of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is undergoing profound political and economic \nchange as it moves toward a market economy and multiparty democracy. Presidential \nelections in December 1991 were marred by government intimidation and electoral fraud. \nThe presidential election in 2005 and local elections in March 2006 were markedly fairer. \nThe presidential election in April 2018 and the parliamentary elections in July 2018 were \nconsidered free and fair by international and domestic observers. \nThe Department of State has issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory for Ukraine \n(exercise increased caution) due to crime and civil unrest. Crime targeted at foreigners is \ncommon, due to their perceived wealth. Ukraine has deployed a new professional and \nwell-trained police force, but police corruption is a significant issue. Demonstrations \nregularly occur through Ukraine and are sometimes violent. Politically targeted \nassassinations, bombings, and attacks on minority groups and police have occurred. \nUkraine has significant human rights problems. Torture, arbitrary detention of \npersons critical of the government, and warrantless violations of privacy are illegal but \ncommon. Ukraine has substantial problems with the independence of the judiciary and \nwidespread government corruption. The Ukrainian government generally fails to \nadequately investigate or take steps to prosecute or punish officials who commit human \nrights abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \nThe Department of State has issued a \u201cdo not travel\u201d warning for areas in Ukraine \noccupied by Russian authorities. The U.S. government prohibits its employees from \ntraveling to Crimea or regions controlled by the Russians. \n \nU.S. Government assistance to Ukraine aims to support the development of a \nsecure, democratic, prosperous, and free Ukraine, fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic \ncommunity. The United States has granted Ukraine market-economy status and given \nUkraine permanent normal-trade-relations status. The United States and Ukraine have a \nbilateral investment treaty. The U.S-Ukraine Council on Trade and Investment has \nworked to increase commercial and investment opportunities by identifying and removing \nimpediments to bilateral and investment flows.  \nUkraine and the United States belong to a number of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and Euro-\nAtlantic Partnership Council. There is no indication in the administrative notice documents \nindicating that Ukraine targets the United States for military or economic espionage. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s spouse, stepson, father-in-law, and mother-in-\nlaw are citizens and residents of Ukraine (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) and that that his spouse owns \nan apartment in Ukraine (SOR \u00b6 1.e). It also alleges that he has numerous foreign \ncontacts who are Ukrainian nationals (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and numerous foreign contacts who are \nRussian nationals. (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign \ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); \nsee also ISCR Case No. 09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011). Applicant has not \nrebutted this presumption. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e) and 7(f) all require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-\n05839 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) are established. Ukraine is a friendly country and the recipient \nof substantial assistance from the United States in economic and military matters. It does \nnot have a history of targeting the United States for economic or military information. \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved and the intelligence-gathering \nhistory of that government are among the important considerations that provide context \nfor the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another important \nconsideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) is established. The same factors that establish a \u201cheightened risk\u201d are \nsufficient to establish a potential risk of a conflict of interest. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f) is not established. Applicant has no significant assets in Ukraine. His \nwife\u2019s modest apartment is of nominal value, and she is in the process of disposing of it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nNevertheless, Ukraine\u2019s civil unrest, domestic violence, crimes against foreigners, \ngovernment corruption, significant human-rights violations, and the presence of nearby \nRussian occupying forces are sufficient to meet the low standard of \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \nAG \u00b6 8(d): the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government \nbusiness or are approved by the agency head or designee. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established, for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s loyalty to his wife, stepson, and in-laws is not \nminimal. He lives with them in Ukraine because of his assignment as a linguist and not \ndue to a preference for Ukraine over the United States. He has deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His parents and sister are native-born \nU.S. citizens and residents. He maintains contact with close friends from his college days, \nwho live in the United States. He volunteered to serve with the Peace Corps in Ukraine \nto promote the values of the United States. Until the COVID travel restrictions were \nimposed, he frequently returned to the United States to visit family and friends. He has \nnot sought Ukrainian citizenship. To the contrary, his goal is for his wife and stepson to \nmove to the United States and become U.S. citizens.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is partially established. Applicant has terminated all his contacts with \nRussian citizens, which began while he was a student in Russia. He has terminated all \nhis contacts with Ukrainian citizens, except for his wife, stepson, father-in-law and mother-\nin-law, and two long-time friends that he met while working for the Peace Corps. \nAG \u00b6 8(d) is established for Applicant\u2019s Peace Corps involvement in Ukraine, which \nwas U.S. Government business. It is not established for Applicant\u2019s participation in the \nstudy of the Russian language or his continued contact with his wife, stepson, in-laws, or \ntwo Ukrainian friends. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Most of Applicant\u2019s Ukrainian connections were the result of his \nservice as a Peace Corps volunteer, carrying out an important mission of the U.S. \nGovernment. In his SCA, counterintelligence screening, answer to the SOR, and \nresponse to the FORM, he was meticulous and candid, erring on the side of caution when \nhe disclosed that many of his Peace Corps contacts were technically employed by the \nUkrainian Ministry of Education and Science and when he meticulously disclosed several \ncontacts that probably did not qualify as \u201cclose and/or continuing contact,\u201d as specified in \nthe SCA instructions. He severed several casual friendships when he learned that they \nraised security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his connections to Russia and \nUkraine. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B, Foreign Influence: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 26, 2019. On \nApril 20, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On August 17, 2020, he withdrew his request for a hearing \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel appealed my decision. In her appeal brief, she argued that I \nerred by failing to apply the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard in analyzing Applicant\u2019s \nevidence in mitigation, citing ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 28, 2015). The \nAppeal Board noted that Department Counsel raised the applicability of the \u201cvery heavy \nburden\u201d standard for the first time on appeal, and that she had not asserted that it should \nbe applied in the FORM or her request for administrative notice. Because Department \nCounsel did not give Applicant or me notice of the Government\u2019s position on the issue, \nthe Appeal Board remanded the case on July 6, 2021, and directed me to reopen the \nrecord, address the applicability of the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard, and issue a new \ndecision in the case. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nand requested a decision on the written record without a hearing.

He responded to the FORM on October 16, 2020, and the case was assigned \nto me on February 25, 2021. On March 18, 2021, I issued my decision granting Applicant\u2019s \napplication for a security clearance. \nOn August 5, 2021, I notified Applicant of the Appeal Board\u2019s decision and \nrequested that he submit any additional evidence and arguments for my consideration \nwithin 30 days. He responded on August 9, 2021, and submitted Remand Exhibit (RX) I. \nOn August 10, 2021, I furnished Department Counsel with a copy of RX I and requested \nthat she submit any comments by August 18, 2021. She submitted RX II on August 17, \n2021. The record closed on August 18, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nFor clarity, I have repeated my previous findings of fact in this decision on remand. \nI adhere to the findings of fact in my previous decision and incorporate them in this \nremand decision, with the following additions and modifications. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \nwith explanations, and he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g.

He served as a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine from \nSeptember 2016 to November 2018. The Peace Corps is an independent agency in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government, and Applicant\u2019s participation in the Peace \nCorps activities in Ukraine was U.S. Government business. He has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since December 2018, awaiting an assignment as a linguist in Ukraine \nin support of a U.S. Armed Forces multilateral training mission. \nApplicant married a citizen and resident of Ukraine in January 2019. He lives in \nUkraine with his wife and her 14-year-old son. In his response to the FORM, he stated \nthat he married in June 2019, which apparently is a mistake, because it is inconsistent \nwith his SCA and the counterintelligence screening interview report, which reflect a \nJanuary 2019 marriage. (FORM Item 4 at 34; Item 5 at 1-2.) His wife\u2019s son was born \nduring his wife\u2019s previous marriage to a citizen and resident of Ukraine. His wife divorced \nher first husband when her son was an infant. She and her son have no contact with her \nson\u2019s biological father. (Answer at 8.) His wife\u2019s mother, also a citizen and resident of \nUkraine, lives across the street from them. (FORM Item 4 at 37-40.) Applicant\u2019s father-in-\nlaw passed away on April 16, 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s wife owns an apartment in Ukraine where Applicant and she live, and \nshe has several Ukrainian bank accounts worth about $7,500. Her apartment is a 45-\nsquare meter, one-story, one-bedroom apartment worth about $16,000. (FORM Item 5 at \n12.) She intends to dispose of it if Applicant receives a security clearance and is eligible \nto assume his new position. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has never visited the United States. Although she intends to apply \nfor a U.S. visa, Applicant stated in his SCA that it will be \u201csome years from now.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s wife works as a freelance translator and is not associated with any \nUkrainian business. She has never worked for the Ukrainian government or any foreign \nintelligence entities. (Answer to SOR at 3.) Before Applicant became acquainted with her, \nshe voluntarily provided translation services for the Peace Corps and received a letter of \nappreciation for her support. (Answer to SOR at 15-16.) \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law directed a children\u2019s folk dance \nensemble for 24 years. (FORM Item 4 at 39-40.)

(Answer at 7.) \nDuring a counterintelligence screening interview in February 2019, Applicant \nstated that he would like to work for the U.S. Government in Ukraine for about ten years. \n(Item 5 at 5.) He also told the interviewer that his financial situation was \u201ca perilous one,\u201d \nbecause he was unemployed and dependent on his parents and his savings for living \nexpenses and student loan payments. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) He has improved his financial \nsituation since the screening interview by working as a freelance translator. As of October \n16, 2020, when he responded to the FORM, he had worked as a freelance translator \nsince January 2017 and been paid $5,451 since November 1, 2019; $3,032 since May 1, \n2020; $2,376 since August 1, 2020; and $1,685 since October 1, 2020. (FORM Response \nat 5.) He also had contracted with a U.S.-based museum to work on a project for an \nhonorarium of $2,019. (Attachments to FORM Response.) In his response to the remand, \nhe provided evidence that he had paid off a student loan and increased his assets in the \nUnited States by about $8,000. (RX I, Appendices III and IV.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he disclosed that he received a job offer in January 2019 from \na Ukrainian company. The job involved customer support and consulting in \u201cvirtual data \nrooms.\u201d He stated that he was never \u201ctechnically offered\u201d a position, but was invited for a \nfinal candidacy interview. He declined the interview because he was pursuing \nemployment with a defense contractor. (FORM Item 4 at 77.) In his response to the \nFORM, he stated that the Ukrainian company offered him an annual salary of $27,600, \nwhich he states is \u201castronomical\u201d by Ukrainian standards. He stated that he rejected the \noffer in order to accept his current position with a defense contractor, realizing that there \nwas no guarantee that he would be granted a security clearance. (FORM Response at \n4.) During the counterintelligence screening interview in February 2019, he told the \ninterviewer that he had been interviewed by the Ukrainian company and had declined a \nsecond interview in order to attend the screening interview. He also told the interviewer \nthat if the Ukrainian company called him again, he would accept its offer. (FORM Item 5 \nat 9.) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he listed several citizens of Ukraine and \nRussia in the section asking, \u201cDo you have, or have you had, close and/or continuing \ncontact with a foreign national within the last seven (7) years with whom you or your \nspouse . . . are bound by affection influence, common interest, and/or obligation?\u201d In his \nresponse to the FORM, he described his current relationships with his Ukrainian and \nRussian contacts. Except for his wife, stepson, and in-laws, all of his Ukrainian contacts \nwere related to his service in the Peace Corps and employed by a Ukrainian state \nuniversity. As such, they were employees of the Ukrainian Minister of Education and \nScience. After learning that they raised security concerns, he cut off contact with all of his \nRussian contacts and all but two Ukrainian contacts. (FORM Response at 6-9). One of \nthese two Ukrainian contacts is now a freelance web developer and the other is a self-\nemployed illustrator. (FORM Item 4 at 44, 49.)

Two of Applicant\u2019s Ukrainian contacts who are former Peace Corps colleagues \n(identified in Appendix A of my March 2021 decision as \u201cAO\u201d and \u201cLK\u201d) left Ukraine and \nnow reside in Germany. They are unable to leave Germany due to COVID restrictions. \nApplicant believes that they intend to seek Canadian citizenship and do not intend to \nreturn to Ukraine. \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s former colleagues in the Peace Corps submitted letters lauding \nhim for his loyalty, integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm, and his passionate attitude about his \nservice to the United States and the mission of the Peace Corps in Ukraine. One of his \ncolleagues was impressed by the way Applicant handled a situation reflecting the \nendemic corruption in the Ukrainian education system. Applicant and several other Peace \nCorps volunteers had offered to serve as judges in a yearly Olympiad for Ukrainian \nstudents. When Ukrainian officials refused to correct a mistake in scoring, Applicant \npulled all the Peace Corps volunteers out of judging the competition and did so in a way \nthat did not damage the relations between the Peace Corps and the Ukrainian Ministry of \nEducation and Science. (Attachments to FORM Response.) \nAt the request of Department Counsel and without objection by Applicant, I have \ntaken administrative notice of relevant facts about Ukraine. I also have taken \nadministrative notice on my own motion, without objection from either party, of the facts \nset out in the U.S. Department of State document, \u201cU.S. Relations with Ukraine, Bilateral \nRelations Fact Sheet, dated December 18, 2020 (www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-\nukraine). The facts administratively noticed are set out below. \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with Ukraine in 1991, following \nits independence from the Soviet Union. The United States attaches great importance to \nthe success of Ukraine as a free and democratic state with a flourishing market economy. \nThe U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership highlights the importance of the \nbilateral relationship and continue commitment of the United States to support enhanced \nengagement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Ukraine. \nUkraine has had a parliamentary-presidential type of government since becoming \nindependent of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is undergoing profound political and economic \nchange as it moves toward a market economy and multiparty democracy. Presidential \nelections in December 1991 were marred by government intimidation and electoral fraud. \nThe presidential election in 2005 and local elections in March 2006 were markedly fairer. \nThe presidential election in April 2018 and the parliamentary elections in July 2018 were \nconsidered free and fair by international and domestic observers. \nUkraine has significant human rights problems. Torture, arbitrary detention of \npersons critical of the government, and warrantless violations of privacy are illegal but \ncommon. Ukraine has substantial problems with the independence of the judiciary and \nwidespread government corruption. The Ukrainian government generally fails to \nadequately investigate or take steps to prosecute or punish officials who commit human \nrights abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Government assistance to Ukraine aims to support the development of a \nsecure, democratic, prosperous, and free Ukraine, fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic \ncommunity. The United States has granted Ukraine market-economy status and given \nUkraine permanent normal-trade-relations status. The United States and Ukraine have a \nbilateral investment treaty. The U.S-Ukraine Council on Trade and Investment has \nworked to increase commercial and investment opportunities by identifying and removing \nimpediments to bilateral and investment flows.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant maintains close relationships with his family and friends in the United \nStates. He has purchased an airline ticket to attend his sister\u2019s wedding in the United \nStates in May 2022, to visit a close friend who was the best man at his wedding, and to \nspend two weeks with his parent. (RX I, Appendix I.) \n \n \n \nUkraine and the United States belong to a number of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and Euro-\nAtlantic Partnership Council. There is no indication in the administrative notice documents \nindicating that Ukraine targets the United States for military or economic espionage. \nIn my original decision I took administrative notice of the facts in the U.S. \nDepartment of State Travel Advisory dated August 24, 2020, which was included in the \nFORM. The Department of State issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory for Ukraine (reconsider \ntravel) due to COVID, crime, and civil unrest. The travel advisory noted that crime \ntargeting foreigners and property\u202fis common; that demonstrations, which have turned \nviolent at times, regularly occur throughout Ukraine; that politically targeted \nassassinations and bombings have occurred; and that there were reports of violent \nattacks on minority groups and police\u202fby\u202fradical\u202fgroups. The same travel advisory \npublished Level 4 (\u201cdo not travel\u201d) warning for areas in Ukraine occupied by Russian \nauthorities. The U.S. government prohibits its employees from traveling to Crimea or \nregions controlled by the Russians. \nIn this remand decision, I have also taken administrative notice of the facts set out \nin the U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory dated July 26, 2021, which was cited by \nDepartment Counsel RX II at 3 and Item II. The July 2021 travel advisory superseded the \nAugust 2020 Level 3 travel advisory (\u201creconsider travel\u201d), which was applicable when my \nMarch 2021 decision was issued. The July 2021 travel advisory published a Level 2 \nadvisory (exercise caution) for Ukraine, based on COVID, crime, and civil unrest, and \npublished a separate Level 4 advisory (\u201cdo not travel\u201d) for Crimea and the Russian-\noccupied areas in eastern Ukraine. \nApplicant is an active alumnus of the U.S. university from which he graduated in \nMay 2015.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s spouse, stepson, father-in-law, and mother-in-\nlaw are citizens and residents of Ukraine (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) and that that his spouse owns \nan apartment in Ukraine (SOR \u00b6 1.e). It also alleges that he has numerous foreign \ncontacts who are Ukrainian nationals (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and numerous foreign contacts who are \nRussian nationals. (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved and the intelligence-gathering \nhistory of that government are among the important considerations that provide context \nfor the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another important \nconsideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018). \n \nWhen family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign \ncountry as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's \nspouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); \nsee also ISCR Case No. 09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011). Applicant has not \nrebutted this presumption. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e) and 7(f) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above a \nState Department Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent \nto the level 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d) currently in effect for Ukraine. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) are established. Ukraine is a friendly country and the recipient \nof substantial assistance from the United States in economic and military matters. It does \nnot have a history of targeting the United States for economic or military information. \nNevertheless, Ukraine\u2019s civil unrest, domestic violence, crimes against foreigners, \ngovernment corruption, significant human-rights violations, and the presence of nearby \nRussian occupying forces are sufficient to meet the low standard of \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d was recognized in the U.S. State Department Level 3 Travel Advisory \n(reconsider travel) in July 2020, which was in effect when my March 2021 decision was \nissued. The August 2021 Level 2 advisory (exercise increased caution) reflects increased \nstability in Ukraine but did not lower the level of risk below the \u201cheightened risk\u201d \ncontemplated by this disqualifying condition.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) is established. The same factors that establish a \u201cheightened risk\u201d are \nsufficient to establish a potential risk of a conflict of interest. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f) is not established. Applicant has no significant assets in Ukraine. His \nwife\u2019s modest apartment is of nominal value, and she intends to dispose of it. Her plans \nto dispose of the apartment have stalled because of the uncertainty about Applicant\u2019s \nability to accept his new assignment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \nAG \u00b6 8(d): the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government \nbusiness or are approved by the agency head or designee. \nDepartment Counsel asserts that the geopolitical situation in Ukraine is the \nequivalent of the situation in a hostile country, requiring the application of the \u201cvery heavy \nburden\u201d standard to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence. She cited ISCR Case No. 14-02563 \n(App. Bd. Aug 28, 2015) in support of her assertion, and the Appeal Board noted its \ndecision in ISCR Case No. 12-05092 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2017). \nThe Appeal Board decisions in these two cases are of reduced relevance because \nthey were based on facts that have changed significantly. In both cases, an administrative \njudge denied a clearance to an applicant with family in Ukraine because of the geopolitical \nsituation in 2014-2015, when the level of civil unrest and Russian aggressiveness raised \nquestions about the ability of the Ukrainian government to survive. The administrative \njudge in ISCR Case No. 12-05092 commented: \u201cOf significant note is the State \nDepartment\u2019s current warning against travel to Ukraine, a country that is essentially in the \nmidst of a civil war where separatist forces are backed by a hostile foreign power. This \nsignificant change puts this close familial connection in a different light, requiring a \nheightened level of scrutiny.\u201d The current situation in Ukraine is not a Level 4 (\u201cdo not \ntravel\u201d) situation; it is a Level 2 (\u201cexercise increased caution) situation. Whether a foreign \ncountry is hostile to the United States is determined by the executive branch, not by \njudicial decisions. In this case the U.S. Department of State has recognized the division \nof Ukraine into safe and unsafe areas by issuing a two-part advisory, announcing a Level \n2 situation for Ukraine and a separate Level 4 situation for Crimea and Russian-occupied \nareas of eastern Ukraine. \nThe Appeal Board decision in ISCR Case No. 19-01689 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2020) \nupheld an administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a clearance to an applicant with ties to \nAfghanistan, until recently a friendly country, and declined to apply the \u201cvery heavy \nburden\u201d to the applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. The decision is instructive for two \nreasons. First, it demonstrates how quickly the geopolitical situation in a country can \nchange; and second, it articulates the factors to be considered in determining when the \n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d should apply The Appeal Board declined to apply the \u201cvery heavy \nburden\u201d based solely on conditions in Afghanistan, such as terrorism, unrest, and \ninstability, without consideration of actions taken by the Afghan Government. The Appeal \nboard noted that Department Counsel had failed to show that the Afghan Government's \ninterests are adverse to U.S. interests, that it has established policies or taken actions \nthat threaten U.S. national security, or that it is involved in any form of espionage against \nthe United States. Based on this guidance, I have concluded that the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nshould not apply to Ukraine, because it would be inconsistent with the U.S. State \nDepartment\u2019s current assessment of the geopolitical situation in Ukraine. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMy findings regarding the mitigating conditions in this case are as follows: \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established, for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e). \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s loyalty to his wife, stepson, and mother in-law \nis not minimal. He lives with them in Ukraine because of his assignment as a linguist and \nnot due to a preference for Ukraine over the United States. He has deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His parents and sister are native-born \nU.S. citizens and residents. He maintains contact with close friends from his college days, \nwho live in the United States. He volunteered to serve with the Peace Corps in Ukraine \nto promote the values of the United States. Until the COVID travel restrictions were \nimposed, he frequently returned to the United States to visit family and friends. He has \nnot sought Ukrainian citizenship. To the contrary, his goal is for his wife and stepson to \nmove to the United States and become U.S. citizens.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established.

He has terminated all his contacts \nwith Ukrainian citizens, except for his wife, stepson, and mother-in-law, and two longtime \nfriends that he met while working for the Peace Corps. His two Ukrainian friends no longer \nreside in Ukraine and do not intend to return. However, his contacts with his wife, stepson, \nand mother-in-law are not infrequent or casual. \nAG \u00b6 8(d) is established for Applicant\u2019s Peace Corps involvement in Ukraine, which \nwas U.S. Government business. It is not established for Applicant\u2019s participation in the \nstudy of the Russian language or his continued contact with his wife, stepson, in-laws, or \ntwo Ukrainian friends. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income as \nrequired. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. He also failed to pay his federal and state \nincome taxes for tax years 2010 through 2018; timely file his federal and state income \ntaxes for tax years 2013 through 2018; and owed approximately $40,000 in delinquent \nfederal and state taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIt is well established that failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant \nhas difficulty with abiding by government rules and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). It is also well established that the mere filing of \npast-due returns or resolution of delinquent tax debts does not compel a favorable \nsecurity-clearance adjudication. ISCR Case No. 17-01907 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). The \ntiming of corrective action is an important factor in determining whether security concerns \nraised by tax delinquencies are mitigated. Applicants who wait until their clearances are \nin jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nApplicant\u2019s financial support for his family who have resided overseas since 2008 \nand his unexpected 2014 work termination are conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control that \npartially contributed to his financial problems. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) only partially \napplies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under his circumstances. He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h, \nand he intended to dispute the minimal debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. I find that \u00b6 20(d) applies to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h and \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nApplicant has not sought professional tax assistance or debt counseling since he \nfirst encountered difficulty with handling his taxes in 2008. As of June 2021, he had not \nyet filed his delinquent federal and state tax returns, made any payments toward his \ndelinquent taxes, or taken other action to secure payment arrangements with the IRS or \nthe state tax authority. I also find that such behavior did not happen so long ago, was not \ninfrequent, and did not occur under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. It \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \nany disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; . . . and, \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n . . . (2) \nApplicant was terminated due to unacceptable behavior involving him massaging \nother employees\u2019 and non-employees\u2019 necks. While his termination occurred seven years \nago and was an isolated incident, his spouse was not yet aware of it or its surrounding \ncircumstances as of the date of the hearing. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s termination occurred seven years ago and was an isolated incident. He \nwas candid and credible at the hearing. However, his spouse remained unaware of his \ntermination or the circumstances surrounding it at the time of the hearing. I continue to \nhave doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), \n17(d), and 17(e) do not apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d - h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications on August 2, 2018 and \nOctober 21, 2019. On August 19, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 11, 2020, and requested a decision \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 26, 2020, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an \nopportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the \nFORM on November 4, 2020, and did not respond. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 14, 2021. \nProcedural Matter \nOn February 1, 2021, the Government proffered a copy of Item 6, which was \ninadvertently omitted from the FORM previously submitted and sent to Applicant. With \nnotice to both parties, I reopened the record to provide Applicant with an opportunity to \nrespond, including by providing any additional documents or information that he wanted \nme to consider in his case. Applicant did not respond in the allotted time so I closed the \nrecord on February 5, 2021. I appended copies of the emails exchanged concerning this \nissue to the record as Administrative Exhibit (AE) I. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItem 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 7 are admitted into \nevidence. Item 7 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 7. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 7 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise an objection to Item 7 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nthat Item 7 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant neither responded to \nthe FORM nor otherwise raised an objection to Item 7. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 30, is married with four minor children.

He did not \nindicate whether his wife satisfied that loan. However, he denied the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b on the basis that he did not have an account with the creditor in his individual \nname or jointly with his wife. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is reflected as an individual \naccount on Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated September 2018 and October 2019. He \nclaimed to have filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from his credit reports. The \ndispute was not documented in the record. The debt did not appear on his October \n2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 4; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6; Item 7 at 7) \nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c on the basis that the automobile \nloan was settled in full by insurance proceeds paid to the creditor following a total-loss \naccident in 2015. His automobile insurance company paid the creditor approximately \n$3,000 less than the balance remaining on the loan. He was assured that his gap \ninsurance would resolve the deficiency. Applicant claimed to have filed a dispute to \nhave the debt deleted from his credit reports. The dispute was not documented in the \nrecord. The debt did not appear on his October 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 4-5; Item \n6) \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which relates to a loan he \nreceived in approximately 2014 to pay for expenses associated with a family medical \nemergency. He claimed that he repaid the loan in full via monthly allotments from his \nmilitary pay sometime between 2014 and 2016. However, in approximately 2017, he \nwas notified by the creditor that it obtained a court judgment for a \u201cminimal\u201d remaining \nbalance due, including accrued interest. He had not been previously aware that his \nallotments did not cover the entire balance. Since then, the interest has continued to \nincrease the balance due. He asserted that he has been in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with the \ncreditor to try to negotiate a settlement. He filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from \nhis credit reports. The dispute was noted on his October 2020 credit report, but the debt \nwas not deleted. (Item 1 at 5; Item 2 at 38-39; Item 3 at 42-43 Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5-6) \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which was a \u201ccredit builder\u201d \nloan account he opened in 2018. In his September 2020 SOR answer, Applicant \nclaimed to have initiated contact with the creditor to repay this debt. His October 2020 \ncredit report revealed that the debt remained unresolved. (Item 1 at 5; Item 4 at 3; Item \n5 at 2; Item 6 at 2-3) \nApplicant acknowledged having a utility account with the creditor alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.f. However, he denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f on the basis that he returned \nthe equipment for which he was being charged. He asserted that he completed the \nreturn in approximately November 2018 when he relocated to his present home state. \nApplicant claimed to have filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from his credit \nreports. The dispute was not documented in the record. The debt did not appear on his \nOctober 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 5; Item 5 at 2; Item 6) \nApplicant acknowledged that he currently maintains an active account with the \ncreditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g.

Applicant claimed to have \nfiled a dispute to have the debt deleted from his credit reports. The dispute was not \ndocumented in the record. The debt did not appear on his October 2020 credit report. \n(Item 1 at 5; Item 3 at 43-44; Item 5 at 2) \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, which is a charge for carpet \ndamage that was discovered in his military housing when he discharged from active \nduty in 2018. He claimed that he was unaware of the charge until he was notified by the \ncreditor in June 2019. In his September 2020 SOR answer, he maintained that the debt \nwas \u201csettled and paid.\u201d The debt remained delinquent on his October 2020 credit report. \n(Item 1 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 2) \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, which is a charge for an \noverpayment of his G.I. bill-related housing allowance. He claimed that he was unaware \nof the overpayment until his funds were garnished in January 2020. He then learned \nthat the charge related to a one-month period when he was not enrolled in school. He \nmaintained that he was enrolled during that period but experienced connectivity issues \nto his online school due to being on TDY outside of the United States. The debt was \nreflected as paid on his October 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 5) \nApplicant admitted having a bank account with the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, \nwhich was in good standing when he closed it in 2012. He also acknowledged another \njoint bank account with the same creditor (that he maintained with his wife), which was \nin good standing when they closed it in 2018. However, he denied the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.j on the basis that it is unknown to him. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j is \nreflected as an individual account on Applicant\u2019s credit report dated October 2019. He \nclaimed to have filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from his credit reports. The \ndispute was not documented in the record. The debt did not appear on his October \n2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 6; Item 4 at 6; Item 6; Item 7 at 7) \nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k on the basis that it is unknown to \nhim. He discovered that the debt is a women\u2019s health clinic charge in the state where he \nwas stationed from 2012 through 2015. During those years, all medical expenses for \nhim, his wife, and children were covered by his military insurance plan. He claimed that \nhe was unable to resolve the debt with the clinic directly. The clinic referred him to a \ncollection agency, the contact information for which he averred that he has been unable \nto ascertain. He claimed to have filed a dispute to have the debt deleted from his credit \nreports. The dispute was not documented in the record. The debt did not appear on his \nOctober 2020 credit report. (Item 1 at 6; Item 4 at 6; Item 7 at 7) \nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l on the basis that it was a \nduplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He asserted that the creditor reported the \nsame account twice. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.l are reflected as two \ndifferent individual accounts with the same creditor on Applicant\u2019s September 2018 and \nOctober 2020 credit reports.

There is no indication in either report that the two different accounts \nreference the same debt. Applicant filed a dispute to have the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l \ndeleted from his credit reports. Although the debt had not been deleted, the dispute was \nreflected on his October 2020 credit report. An increased balance of $14,756 was also \nreported. (Item 1 at 4, 6; Item 4 at 7; Item 5; Item 6 at 3-4) \nApplicant\u2019s October 2020 credit report revealed two delinquent debts not alleged \nin the SOR. First, an individual utility account placed for collection in October 2019 with \na $2,406 balance. Second, a joint home rental account placed for collection in June \n2019 with a $9,069 balance. The report noted a consumer dispute for each of these \ndebts. The record did not reflect any other information about these new debts. Because \nthey were not alleged in the SOR, I will consider them solely for the purpose of \nevaluating mitigation and the whole person concept. (Item 6 at 1-2) \nDuring his January 2019 background investigation interview, Applicant \ncharacterized his financial situation as \u201cin debt recovery mode.\u201d During that interview, \nhe was confronted with the debts that appeared on his September 2018 credit report, \nthe majority of which he claimed no prior knowledge. He explained that he had not \nbrought any financial-related documents to his interview because he lost access to them \nwhen his military email was deactivated. He affirmed that he was willing and able to \nrepay his debts. He anticipated using the extra funds he had then recently received as \nhazard pay to help him resolve his delinquent debts. The record did not contain \ninformation concerning the amount of those extra funds or an allocation as to how they \nwere applied, if at all, to his delinquent debts. He also anticipated engaging a company \nto help him \u201cfix his credit.\u201d He did not proffer whether he engaged those services or \notherwise received assistance with repaying his debts. (Item 7 at 9) \nApplicant did not provide any documents to corroborate the claims he made in \nhis SOR answer. He also did not proffer any information concerning his relevant income \nand expenses. He has not received any financial counseling. However, he took a \nfinancial class about smart spending. He believes that his maturity and other lifestyle \nchanges will ensure that he has no future financial difficulties. Those changes include \nmaking more informed decisions, maintaining a proper debt-to-income ratio, and \nmodifying his spending habits. He stated that he is \u201cpast the age where he wants what \nhe sees on TV.\u201d His is now motivated by his desire to build a better life for his wife and \nchildren. (Item 7 at 9) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG \u00b6 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). \nThe following are potentially applicable factors that could mitigate the security \nconcerns raised in the SOR: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nGiven that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i has been resolved, I find that allegation \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. However, he failed to establish that he successfully disputed the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k, or 1.l, or resolved the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, or 1.h. He did not establish that the debts which did not \nappear on his October 2020 credit report were removed because he was not \nresponsible for repayment. The mere disappearance of debts from a credit report does \nnot, without more information, absolve him from liability. While he proffered reasonable \nbases for his disputes, he did not provide documented proof to substantiate them. \nAlthough his disputes of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d., and 1.l were documented, the debts were not \ndeleted from his credit report. The other disputes were not documented. \nApplicant did not establish that his debts resulted from and persisted largely due \nto circumstances beyond his control. He did not proffer sufficient documentary evidence \nto corroborate the efforts he made to address his delinquent debts. I considered that \nApplicant lost access to certain financial documents when his military email was \ndeactivated. However, that does not fully relieve him of his obligation to substantiate his \nmitigation claims. I do not have information sufficient to conclude that Applicant \nexhausted all options to obtain relevant documentation. In light of the record before me, \nI cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns pursuant to the \nabove mitigating factors. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nAG, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes seven conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of these apply; and as such, Financial Considerations is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. She has not met her burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.f: \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Due to parental pressures, concern about her \nfather\u2019s health, and lack of employment, she chose to relocate back to Turkey in August \n2009. (Tr. pp. 40-45, and Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nOnce in Turkey, Applicant established her roots there. In 2011, she married a \nTurkish man, who was a dentist. Applicant states that when she married him she \nwanted to relocate to the United States, but she never discussed the issue with him \nbefore they married. He had no interest in coming to the United States. They divorced \nin March 2017. (Tr. pp. 67-60.) \nFrom November 2009 to July 2018, Applicant worked for the Turkish Aerospace \nIndustries (TAI), manufacturing and providing various forms of military aircraft, drones, \nunmanned surveillance and other aerospace equipment exclusively for the Turkish \nGovernment. Over the nine years she worked there, she advanced from a tool design \nengineer to a manufacturing engineer, and program leader, a position she enjoyed. \nWhile in Turkey, working for TAI, Applicant developed many engineering contacts and \nmet employees who worked for her current employer in the U.S. Some of them had \nlong-term contracts working for Applicant\u2019s current employer and were assigned to \nTurkey. Applicant established communications with these individuals while they were \nworking in Turkey. \nOver time they became good friends and Applicant ultimately \nlearned about her current job position in the U.S. from one of these individuals. (Tr. p. \n53.) \nIn 2018, Applicant, from Turkey, applied for the position with her current \nemployer. She was interviewed over the telephone and hired. (Tr. p. 91.) Applicant \nmoved to the United States in July 2018, and began working for her current employer. \nIn 2019, she met her current husband, a Turkish national. They were married in \nNovember 2020. (Tr. p. 62.) He has an extension on his green card, and recently filed \nan application for a new green card based on his marriage to the Applicant. He is \ncurrently unemployed.  (Tr. p. 64.) \nApplicant maintains contact with friends and former colleagues who are currently \nemployed by the TAI in various roles working on projects with and for the Turkish \nmilitary.  (Tr. p. 102.) \nApplicant\u2019s has a number of family members who are citizens and residents of \nTurkey. These family members include Applicant\u2019s father, mother, husband, mother-in-\nlaw, and a cousin. Applicant\u2019s two brothers are dual-citizens of Turkey and the United \nStates. Her older brother resides in the United States. He has a Ph.D in Mechanical \nEngineering, is a professor at a University here, and owns his own company. As a \nprofessor, he is involved in a rotational teaching program allowing him to travel to \nvarious universities within the United States to teach or conduct research. He has not \ntraveled to Turkey for about eight or nine years. Applicant testified that she maintains \nregular contact with her older brother who resides in the United States. She speaks \nwith him about twice a week. They discuss matters pertaining their parents health and \nwell-being. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother was born in the United States, but returned to Turkey \nas an infant. In 2014, he moved from Turkey to the U.S, to attend college. He has \nrecently moved to Texas, and working for a company there. Applicant has not had any \ncontact with him for several years.  \nThe evidence about her foreign connections was conflicting and mixed. \nApplicant stated that, \u201cI hated living in Turkey, especially as a woman, so I was looking \nfor ways out.\u201d (Tr. p. 50.) However, despite becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, \nApplicant exercises Turkish residency. Applicant maintains a bank account in Turkey \nthat has about $200 U.S. dollars in it. She keeps this account open to help her mother if \nshe needs money. She also does not want to ask her parents for money when she \nvisits Turkey. Applicant voted in two elections in Turkey, including the most recent \nPresidential election that occurred in July 2018 because she did not like the President in \nTurkey. Applicant is also eligible to receive a pension from Turkey when she meets the \nage requirement. She believes it will amount to about $300 a month when she is 50 \nyears old. Applicant also has a valid Turkish passport and uses it in lieu of her U.S. \npassport to reenter Turkey for convenience purposes when she travels there. (Tr. p. \n69.) \nIn assessing the heightened risk created as a result of Applicant holding a \nsecurity clearance, the Applicant\u2019s ties to a hostile country are important. However, \neven countries friendly to the United States have attempted to gain unauthorized access \nto classified information. Under the particular facts of this case, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the information provided concerning the Country of Turkey. \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with an executive presidential system and a \nunicameral 600 seat parliament (the Grand National Assembly). \nThe U.S.-Turkey \nrelationship dates back to 1831, when the Unites States established diplomatic relations \nwith the Ottomar Empire. Over the years, the U.S. has been committed to emphasizing \nthe importance of the Turkish government\u2019s adherence to policies and actions that build \npublic trust in the country\u2019s democractic institutions and the rule of law, as well as \nupholding human rights commitments. \nIn recent years, democracy in Turkey has \ncontinued to deteriorate. President Erdogan has ruled Turkey since 2003, and during \nthat time has expanded his control over Turkey and its institutions. U.S. and European \nUnion officials have expressed a number of concerns about authoritarian governance \nand erosion of rule of law and civil liberties in Turkey. Turkey is a member of the UN, \nNATO, and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. However, due to Turkey\u2019s regional \nambitions and a distrust of the United States, the growing authoritarianism of Turkey\u2019s \nleaders are complicating the bilateral relationship and make Turkey more willing to \nchallenge U.S. regional goals. Besides Covid restrictions, travelers are to exercise \nincreased caution due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. There are high-threat \nlocations for terrorism in Turkey directed at affecting official U.S. Government interests, \nwestern tourists and expatriates. Turkey is a source of transit for foreign terrorist \nfighters seeking to join ISIS and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. ISIS \nand ISIS offshoot organizations have a significant presence in northern Syria, and along \nportions of the Turkish/Syrian border. The Kurdistan People\u2019s Congress (also Kongra \nGel, KGK; and Kurdistand Worker\u2019s Party, PKK) has been the most active terrorist \norganization in Turkey, targeting Turkish government facilities and infrastructure. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHuman Rights and fundamental freedoms violations and a compromised rule of law has \nresulted in many arbitrary killings, torture, detention of tens of thousands of persons \nincluding former opposition members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, foreign citizens, \nelected officials, and employees of the U.S. Mission. There are severe restrictions on \nfreedom of expression, threats and violence toward judicial independence, the press, \nunjustified arrests or criminal prosecutions for criticizing government policies or officials. \n(HE-1.)   \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts include her mother, father, two brothers, her \nhusband, mother-on-law, and a cousin. \nShe also has a number of professional \ncolleagues and friends she has worked with whom she remains close to and are also \ncitizens and residents of Turkey, or are dual citizens of both countries, like she is. \nBased upon the evidence presented, these close foreign contacts and unique \nrelationships may pose a threat and negatively influence Applicant\u2019s decision making, \nimpacting the interests and security of the United States. Applicant\u2019s contact with some \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof these individuals is regular and frequent, while with others it is casual, minimal, and \nnot out of the ordinary. Her family members in Turkey pose no undue security risk. \nHowever, most concerning is Applicant\u2019s contacts with the Turkish Aerospace \nemployees. There was no evidence presented that showed similar relationships she \nhas established in the United States. Under the particular circumstances here, the risk-\nbenefit analysis is applicable, and these contacts do pose a significant security risk to \nthe U.S. government. They may manipulate, induce, or influence the Applicant to help a \nforeign person or government in a way that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAs discussed above, most concerning is Applicant\u2019s contacts with her foreign \naerospace associates and long-time friends in Turkey. The nature of the contacts, the \npositions, skills, and activities of these individuals, and the protected information \nApplicant may access could create a risk for foreign influence. These contacts can \nresult in a situation that may create a divided allegiance. Applicant has shown no deep \nand longstanding relationship with or loyalties to the United States. Full mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has not been established. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he may provide information or \nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  \nForeign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s judgement, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. national \ninterests or when the individual acts to conceal it.  By itself: the fact that a \nU.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying without \nan objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment.  The \nsame is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of foreign \ncitizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S. \nApplicant maintains her Turkish passport for convenience purposes and uses it \nwhen she travels to Turkey. Although she is a naturalized U.S. citizen she continues to \nuse privileges afforded exclusively to Turkish citizens. \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 including: \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security interests;\nand \n \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference. \nApplicant\u2019s actions exhibit a strong foreign preference for the country of Turkey. \nShe maintains a Turkish bank account, votes in their elections, is eligible for a pension \nin Turkey when she meets the age requirement, and maintains and uses her Turkish \npassport when she travels there, instead of using her U.S. passport. This is not an \nindividual who shows loyalty to the U.S. or has made a commitment to break her ties \nfrom her permanent home of Turkey. In fact, she is quite immersed with what is going \non in Turkey. Applicant has only been in the United States for a few years now, since \n2018. She has no real assets here in the United States. She does not own a home, \nand there is no evidence of any other assets. The above mitigating condition is not \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Under the \nparticular facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s Turkish connections pose a significant risk to \nthe U.S. government, and she shows a strong foreign preference for Turkey. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.g \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: through 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Information developed during the investigation revealed that he has a $36,379 child support arrearage and a delinquent loan for $1,502. Both debts are alleged in the SOR.

Applicant\u2019s financial problems were \ncaused by events beyond his control. From October 2015 to December 2019, Applicant \nwas medically restricted from working by his physicians, and was unemployed for 51 \nmonths of that 53-month period. During these periods of unemployment, he incurred the \ndebts alleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR), which includes a child support \narrearage. Since returning to work in December 2019, he has resolved one SOR debt, \nand is in good standing with his child support order. His request for continued eligibility \nto occupy a position of trust is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 20, 2020, the DOD issued an SOR detailing security concerns \nunder the foreign influence guideline. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by President \nEisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective \nJune 8, 2017.

I also admitted, without objection, Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5, and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, without objection. I received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on September 1, 2021. (Tr. 12-15) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, a 39-year-old network engineer, has worked for a federal contracting \ncompany since December 2019. He has an associate\u2019s degree and multiple information \ntechnology certifications. He completed a security clearance application in December \n2019. Information developed during the investigation revealed that he has a $36,379 \nchild support arrearage and a delinquent loan for $1,502. Both debts are alleged in the \nSOR. \nIn 2015, while working out of state, Applicant experienced a medical emergency \nthat required him to leave his job. He was diagnosed with two chronic, degenerative eye \ndiseases and required emergency surgery. In the aftermath of the surgery, Applicant\u2019s \ndoctors declared him medically unable to work. His doctor\u2019s ordered him to avoid \nlooking at screens. He was ordered to refrain from lifting any object over five pounds to \navoid placing any pressure on his eyes. He could not drive and relied on his girlfriend, \nwith whom he has lived since September 2015, for transportation. The medical care \nafter surgery required frequent doctors\u2019 appointments and injections in to his eyes to \nhelp them heal properly. After the first surgery, he was unemployed from August 2015 \nto August 2016. Applicant did not like being financially dependent on his girlfriend, so he \nbegan looking for employment - against medical advice. \nIn August 2016, a court ordered Applicant to pay child support for his then eight\u00ad\nyear-old son from a previous relationship. Before the child support order, Applicant \nprovided financial support through an informal arrangement with the child\u2019s mother. At \nthe hearing, he testified that he did not oppose the formalization of his child support \nobligation because he considered his duty to provide for his child a priority. Under the \nterms of the order, Applicant is required to pay $748 per month in support of his son, \nand $100 per month toward $12,700 arrearage. \nApplicant started a network engineering position with a private company in \nAugust 2016, but left the position in October 2016, when his eye conditions became \nacute. He underwent a second surgery in October 2016. As he recovered, Applicant \nresumed looking for employment. He accepted an IT positon with another federal \ncontracting company that required a security clearance. He started the position in \nDecember 2016, after being granted an interim security clearance. However, after \nstarting the position, Applicant realized that the job required skills he did not have. In \nFebruary 2017, Applicant and his employer agreed that he was not a good fit for the \npositon and he was terminated. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn late 2018, Applicant secured a position with another federal contracting \ncompany. After a year of unemployment, Applicant decided to take a celebratory \nvacation with his girlfriend. To pay for the trip, Applicant obtained a loan with the intent \nof repaying it after he returned to work. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) However, Applicant did not start \nthat position because the interim security clearance he had been granted in August \n2016 was revoked. As a result, he remained unemployed and could not repay the \nvacation loan. He remained unemployed from February 2017 to December 2019. He \nallowed the vacation loan to fall into delinquent status. Unable to file unemployment, \nApplicant decided to return to school in February 2017. He used proceeds from his \nstudent loan refund to pay his child support obligation. \nDuring the 38 months of unemployment Applicant experienced after the August \n2016 child support order, he stayed in good standing with the court by enrolling in a \nprogram that required him to report his job hunting efforts to the court on an ongoing \nbasis. He did not disclose to the court that he was under medical orders to not work.  He \napplied for social security disability, but was denied twice. Applicant provided a child \nsupport payment history from September 2016 to April 2021. Over the 56 months \nreported in the payment history, Applicant did not make payments for 33 months, with \nthe longest period of non-payment of 14 months between August 2017 and September \n2018. He remained in the program until he started his current job. \nApplicant was medically cleared to return to work in February 2019. He remained \nunemployed until he was hired for his current job in December 2019. Since returning to \nfull employment, he has paid off the vacation loan. Applicant has paid his child support \nobligation through wage garnishment, the required method of payment in Applicant\u2019s \nstate of residency, since March 2020. \nAs for Applicant\u2019s health, his eye conditions require ongoing, invasive treatment \nand may impact his ability to work going forward. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend testified at the \nhearing. She and Applicant handle their finances jointly. She considers him one of the \nmost financially responsible people she knows. She credits Applicant for improving her \nfinancial habits and health. The credit report in the record shows that Applicant has a \nfavorable credit history with the two SOR debts being his only derogatory accounts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of trust, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, administrative \njudges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2I, the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). Here, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes a \n$36,379 child support arrearage (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $1,502 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for a delinquent \nloan account. The Government has established its prima facie case, and the following \ndisqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by financial mismanagement, \nliving beyond his means, or reckless or irresponsible behavior. They resulted from \nevents beyond his control, the sudden onset of a medical condition that rendered him \nmedically unable to work from October 2015 to February 2019. Despite these \nrestrictions, Applicant continued to pursue employment opportunities so that he could \nmeet his financial obligations. Despite his best efforts to return to work, Applicant was \nunemployed for 51 months between October 2015 and December 2019. As a result of \nhis unemployment, Applicant could not meet his child support obligation; however, he \ntook the necessary steps to remain in good standing with the court. Since returning to \nwork in December 2019, he has resolved the vacation loan and is making payments \nunder the child support order as required. The record supports the following mitigating \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to properly handle \nor safeguard sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered \nthe whole-person factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Despite the limitations caused by his medical \ncondition, Applicant has demonstrated a determination to honor his financial obligations. \nHis actions suggest that he will follow the rules attendant to handling and protecting \nsensitive information with the same attention. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:\n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant access to sensitive information.

The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On May 20, 2020, Applicant answered the \nSOR, admitting subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g, and denying subparagraphs 1.d \nthrough 1.f. She requested a decision without a hearing. On November 6, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Materials (FORM) setting forth the \nGovernment\u2019s argument in support of the SOR, together with supporting documentation. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received a copy of the FORM on November 13, 2020, and was instructed to file \nany objections to this information, or to supplement the file within 30 days of receipt. On \nNovember 30, 2020, Applicant filed a response. Department Counsel did not object. On \nJanuary 28, 2021, the case was assigned to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old married woman with two children, ages five and seven, \nand two adult stepchildren. She is the primary care provider for her family. (Response, \nAttachment (Att.) 6) She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007, a master\u2019s degree of \nbusiness of administration (MBA), and a master of management (MSM) in 2014. (Item 3 at \n12-13; Response at 3, 8) She earned the MBA and MSM while working at a full-time job as \na financial analyst and various part-time jobs. (Item 3 at 12-15, 18; Response at 8) She has \nbeen working in the financial-analysis field for various government contractors since 2007, \nand has been working for her current employer since 2019. She has held a security \nclearance since 2009. \nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in her community. She was \u201cvery \nproficient within the various roles she supported\u201d during her first year on the job. \n(Response, Att. 8) Between 2015 and 2019, Applicant\u2019s ratings with her previous employer \nranged from very good to exceptional. (Response, Atts. 9-11) When she left her previous \nemployer to accept the job with her current employer, \u201cthe indelible impact of her departure \nwas felt immediately.\u201d (Response, Att. 1) \nApplicant\u2019s family was poor. (Response, Att. 2) Consequently, she was solely \nresponsible for financing her college and graduate school education. Beginning in 2003, \nwhen Applicant was 19, she took out multiple public and private student loans. Satisfying \nher loans was a struggle, particularly during the first two years after college graduation \nwhen she earned $12 per hour. (Item 1 at 18) She had to work at several part-time jobs to \nmake ends meet and to satisfy her loans. She managed her finances, in part, by obtaining \ndeferrals on her private student loans. \nIn September 2015, Applicant\u2019s first child was born, and she no longer had the time \nto work any part-time jobs. (Response at 4; Item 2 at 49) Over the next several months, her \nexpenses increased significantly, as she had to pay daycare after returning to work, and \nher student loans came out of deferral status. (Response at 4; Response, Atts. W - X) By \nearly 2016, Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses had increased to approximately $1,962 more \nthan her monthly income. (Response at 4) \nIn March 2016, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, as alleged in \nSOR subparagraph 1.g. (Item 7). The court granted the petition in July 2016, discharging \napproximately $38,000 of debt. (Item 7 at 3-4) \nIn January 2017, Applicant satisfied a public student loan, unlisted on the SOR. \n(Response, Att. E) In March 2018, Applicant hired a financial planner. She worked with the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nplanner through November 2018, and learned \u201cabout ways to manage cash flow, increase \nsavings, and appropriately manage debt.\u201d (Response, Att. 7) \nIn November 2019, Applicant sold her house. (Item 2 at 7) That month, she satisfied \nthe credit-card debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d, totaling $4,585, through a $3,200 \nlump-sum payment, using the proceeds from the sale of her home. (Answer at 11) \nApplicant satisfied subparagraph 1.e, a debt with a principal balance of $817 and an \noverdue payment totaling $189, in its entirety through two payments in March 2020. (Item \n2 at 14) \nSubparagraph 1.f is a private student loan account that has been transferred to a \nnew lender. It totals $5,735. Applicant has been making regular payments for more than \nthree years, and the account is in current status. (Response, Att. F; Response, Att. N) \n \nThe student loan accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, totaling \napproximately $126,000, remain outstanding. Applicant contends that the loans were \npredatory because she was, for the most part, timely paying the interest-only amounts \nbetween 2005 and 2015, but the balances due kept accruing at usurious rates, and became \ncompletely out of control when she placed them in forbearance.  (Item 2 at 6-7; Response, \nAtt. N) Moreover, she contends that she was not properly informed about the difference \nbetween public and private loans, and the various risks associated with placing loans in \nforbearance, when she applied for them as a teenager. Multiple lawsuits are pending \nagainst this student loan creditor throughout the country, including a lawsuit filed by the \nU.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which alleges that the creditor \u201cfailed \nborrowers at every stage of repayment,\u201d \u201cpurposefully made borrowers pay more on their \nloans than they needed to,\u201d and provided \u201cbad and sometimes false information.\u201d \n(Response, Att. W) \n \n \nApplicant researched refinance options through multiple banks. (Response, Atts. L \nand M) None are feasible at this time because Applicant\u2019s income was reduced at the \nbeginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, as she had to take partial time off \nwork to oversee her children\u2019s distance-learning education. (Response at 4; Response, Att. \nP) Although she successfully applied for financial assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act, she is only making two thirds of the salary that she \nmade before the pandemic triggered the shutdown of her oldest child\u2019s school and the \npartial shutdown of her youngest child\u2019s daycare center. (Response, Att. P) \n \n \nApplicant maintains a budget. Per the budget, she pays $106 monthly towards the \nstudent loan debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, and $473 per month for a student loan that \nis not alleged in the SOR. She has $96 in monthly, after-expense income. (Response at 21) \nOver the next two years, Applicant\u2019s daycare cost will cease once her youngest child enters \nkindergarten, and Applicant will have satisfied the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f. \nShe will then seek to consolidate the student loans  alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a \nthrough 1.c.  \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts. Although she obtained a discharge of \napproximately $38,000 of non-priority debts through a bankruptcy action, she continues to \nowe in excess of $100,000 in delinquent student loans. This generates security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \nApplicant presented evidence that she has been making payments towards the \nsatisfaction of the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f for more than three years, and \nthat it is in current payment status, contrary to the SOR allegation. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies. I resolve subparagraph 1.f in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has either satisfied or is in the process of satisfying all of the loans except \nthe student loan accounts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c. She has \nreceived financial counseling for the problem, maintains a budget, is making significant \nmonthly payments towards the satisfaction of another student loan which is not alleged, \nand has a plan for addressing the delinquent SOR student-loan accounts once her \nyoungest child exits daycare and she finishes paying off the debt alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.d. Although she has not filed suit against the creditor who holds the \nstudent-loan accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, her contention that the \nloans were predatory has merit in light of the pending federal CFPB complaint against the \ncreditor, alleging unfair lending practices. In sum, Applicant\u2019s financial problems were \nlargely based upon circumstances beyond her control, she has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, and is making a good-faith effort to repay her creditors. I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) through 20(c) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant did not incur debt to purchase frivolous items or to engage in otherwise \nprofligate spending. Instead, she used debt to finance her education, earning three \ndegrees, two of which she earned while simultaneously working at multiple jobs. During the \ncourse of pursuing post-graduate degrees while working, starting a family, and managing \nher college student loans, she lost control of her finances. Since obtaining a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge, she has been steadily regaining control of her finances, organizing \nthem, and developing a plan to eliminate them. Considering these factors, in tandem with \nher exemplary work performance and character references, I conclude that Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

None of Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers in Taiwan, to include his in-laws, has any government or military affiliation. He \nhas traveled to Taiwan to visit his family numerous times. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has \na U.S. permanent resident card and travels from Taiwan to the United States every six \nmonths. She lives with Applicant and his wife while in the United States. (GX 2; GX 3.) It \nis unclear from the record what, if any, contact Applicant and/or his wife have with her \nfamily members or friends in Taiwan. \nApplicant purchased a house in the United States in 2009. He stated during his \nPSI that he and his wife are solely U.S. citizens with loyalty and allegiance only to the \nUnited States. \nThe United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 U.S. \n- P.R.C. Joint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the \nJoint Communique, the United States recognized the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese \nposition that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique \nalso stated that the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and \nother unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. The United States does not support \nTaiwan independence. \nThe 2019 U.S. Department of State report on human rights in Taiwan noted that \nthere were no reports of significant human rights abuses. However, throughout 2019, \nBeijing adopted a more coercive policy toward Taiwan, seeking to isolate and intimidate \nTaipei into unification on Beijing\u2019s terms. In January 2019, General Secretary Xi delivered \na major speech wherein he claimed that Taiwan\u2019s unification with the P.R.C was \ninevitable and indicated that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model was the only \nacceptable arrangement for unification. That model has been consistently rejected by the \nTaiwanese public and presidential administrations, prompting Beijing to intensify its \nmultipronged campaign to coerce and isolate Taiwan. In implementing this policy, Beijing \nsharply escalated its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan, \nincluding interfering in Taiwan\u2019s media to shape public opinion on China and cross-Strait \nrelations. The deliberate crossing of the Taiwan Strait median line by Chinese fighter \naircraft in March 2019 was the first such crossing in 20 years and marked a sharp \nescalation in the military pressure Beijing has increasingly applied against Taipei. China \nsignaled that its intensifying campaign of military coercion had become official in a key \npolicy document released in July 2019. \nThe United States faces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese \nintelligence operations. China aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected \ninformation and Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic \nespionage. Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave sensitive military applications.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe concern is set forth in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: AG \u00b6 7 \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened \nrisk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The mere \npossession of ties with family in Taiwan is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, if an applicant has such a relationship, this factor alone is sufficient \nto create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise \nof classified information. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, \n2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). The totality of Applicant\u2019s family \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. A[T]here \nis a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the \nimmediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 \nDOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); see also ISCR Case No. 09-06457 at 4 \n(App. Bd.

May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 00-0317, (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. \nAlthough Taiwan\u2019s human rights record is good, Taiwan\u2019s active efforts to collect U.S. \ntechnologies and the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of such technologies \nplaces a high burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his family members in Taiwan do not pose a security risk. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his family members include daily telephone calls and \nperiodic in-person visits in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, who possesses a U.S. \npermanent resident card but remains a Taiwanese citizen, resides with Applicant on an \nannual basis. Such contact is frequent and not casual. It is also likely that Applicant, either \npersonally or through his wife, has contact with additional members of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nfamily and/or her friends. \nApplicant completed his higher education in the United States and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. Applicant and his wife, who has been a U.S. citizen since \n2003, renounced their Taiwanese citizenship\u2019s in 2018. Their children were born in the \nUnited States. He has established substantial ties with the United States, including \npurchasing a house in 2009. He stated that his loyalties are only to the United States. \nHowever, given Applicant\u2019s close ties to his family members in Taiwan, as demonstrated \nthrough his daily telephone calls, doubt remains as to whether Applicant can necessarily \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen for 11 years and he and his wife renounced their \nTaiwanese citizenships over two years ago. However, his close ties to his family members \nin Taiwan heightens the potential for a conflict of interest for Applicant. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his contacts with his family and his property \ninterest in Taiwan. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He previously served as a full-\ntime intern in several different disciplines with another company from May 2014 until \nAugust 2015. He was unemployed from August 2015 until July 2016. A 2011 high school \ngraduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2016. He has never served with the \nU.S. military. He has never been married. He has never been granted a security \nclearance.  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant was a recreational multi-substance abuser whose substances of choice \nduring an 11-year period were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana [used \nwith varying frequency from about August 2007 to about March 2018]; psilocybin \nmushrooms [used in or about October 2014]; and methylenedioxymethamphetamine \n(MDMA), also known as Ecstasy [used in about May 2018] \u2013 all Schedule I Controlled \nSubstances; amphetamine (the prescription medication Adderall\u00ae which was not \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprescribed for him) [used in or about October 2017]; and cocaine [used with varying \nfrequency from about March 2017 to about July 2018] \u2013 both Schedule II Controlled \nSubstances. (Item 3; Item 4; (https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 812 (c)) In order to fund his own use of marijuana, he also sold marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about August 2012 until about March 2013, and again in March 2018. \n(Item 2, at 1-2; Item 3, at 57; Item 4, at 9) \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported that he had smoked or eaten marijuana through \nmarijuana-infused food an estimated 1,000 times between August 2007 and November \n2017. He admitted consuming 0.2 grams of psilocybin mushrooms on one \u201cexperimental\u201d \noccasion in October 2014. He also admitted snorting cocaine on two \u201cexperimental\u201d \noccasions while he was visiting Nicaragua on vacation in March 2017. (Item 3, at 54-57) \nApplicant expanded on his history of drug involvement and substance misuse \nduring two interviews with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) on January 4, and 7, 2019. During the initial interview, he reported using marijuana \nuntil January 2017. Acknowledging that he initially had not been candid, during the \nsecond interview he admitted that he had actually continued using marijuana with friends \nuntil March 2018. His initial comments regarding cocaine use were also incomplete, for \nhe also used cocaine on two occasions in June and July 2018 while attending parties. \nDuring the second interview, he also reported that he had used Ecstasy on one \n\u201cexperimental\u201d occasion while at a concert with friends in May 2018; and that he had used \nAdderall\u00ae on another \u201cexperimental\u201d occasion while at a football game with friends in \nOctober 2017. (Item 4, at 6-11, 15) Applicant refused to divulge the names of anyone who \nwas involved in his drug involvement and substance misuse. (Item 4, at 6-7) \nAlthough Applicant consistently claimed to have no future intentions of using \ncertain identified drugs or controlled substances, in fact, he continued to do so. In his SF \n86, with regard to marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, and cocaine, he stated that he was \npassionate about his job and \u201cif using the substance risks the advancement of [his] career, \n[he] will not use this drug.\u201d (Item 3, at 54-56) The SF 86 was submitted in November 2017, \nyet he continued using marijuana and cocaine, and also added Ecstasy, well past that \ndate. In his Answer to the SOR, he wrote what he considered to be a statement of future \nintent. (Item 2, at 2) In his second OPM interview, he stated that he \u201ccannot say he will \nnot associate with other people that do use marijuana.\u201d (Item 4, at 9) In his response to \nthe interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that at least once a month, he is still in \ncontact with his hallucinogenic drug-using friends, but that while he will not participate in \nthe drug use, he will remove himself from those situations. (Item 4, at 15) \nThere is no evidence of Applicant ever having received drug-counseling or \ntreatment. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v.

The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . . ;  \nand \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser of a variety of \nSchedule I and Schedule II Controlled Substances. He frequently purchased, used, and \nsold marijuana; consumed psilocybin mushrooms; used Ecstasy; used the prescription \nmedication Adderall\u00ae which was not prescribed for him); and used cocaine. Although he \nconsistently claimed to have no future intentions of using certain identified drugs or \ncontrolled substances, in fact, he continued to do so. His expressed comments regarding \nfuture drug involvement and substance misuse fail to clearly and convincingly commit \nhimself to discontinue such misuse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.

He was partially open about his use of some illegal substances \nwhen he completed his SF 86, and for that partial candor, he is given some credit. He \ncontinued being partially candid during his OPM interviews. While he has acknowledged \nhis drug involvement, he has offered no substantial evidence of actions taken to \novercome those issues, such as exploring drug treatment and therapy; changing or \navoiding the environment where the drugs were used; disassociation from drug-using \nassociates and contacts; or evidence to support his claimed abstinence since 2018. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \napproximately 11 years of multi-substance use and misuse, the relatively brief period of \napproximately three years of reported unverified abstinence is considered insufficient to \nconclude that the abstinence will continue, especially after he admitted using various \ndrugs after claiming he would not do so in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s claimed new compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, is in stark \ncontrast to his cavalier attitude towards those same laws, rules, and regulations. His use \nof all of the identified substances; his repeated purchase and sale of marijuana; and his \nmisuse of a prescription drug without possessing a prescription for the drug despite \nknowing that such use was prohibited; his refusal to furnish information regarding his \ndrug-using friends; the absence of any drug-counseling or treatment; and his refusal to \ndisassociate from his drug-using associates and contacts, continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.

Applicant is a 28-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an engineer with his current \nemployer since July 2016. He previously served as a full-time intern in several different \ndisciplines with another company from May 2014 until August 2015. A 2011 high school \ngraduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2016. When completing his SF 86, he \nwas partially candid in acknowledging that he had used a variety of illegal substances. \nWhen questioned twice by an OPM investigator, he was initially partially candid regarding \nhis illegal drug involvement and substance misuse. His professed claims regarding future \nintentions were not actually true, but he now claims that he will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He claims, without verifiable support, that he has been abstinent since 2018. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nOver an 11-year period, Applicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser \nof a variety of Schedule I and Schedule II Controlled Substances. Although he \nconsistently claimed to have no future intentions of using certain identified drugs or \ncontrolled substances, in fact, he continued to do so. His expressed comments regarding \nfuture drug involvement and substance misuse fail to clearly and convincingly commit \nhimself to discontinue such misuse. Moreover, his lack of total candor in both his SF 86 \nand during his OPM interviews; his refusal to furnish full information regarding his drug-\nusing friends; the absence of any drug-counseling or treatment; and his refusal to \ndisassociate himself from his drug-using associates, continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He did not present sufficient evidence to \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate his history of financial problems. He did not intentionally \nprovide false information on a security clearance application. Accordingly, this case is \ndecided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin February 2019. (Exhibit 5) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP. The SF \n86 is commonly known as a security clearance application. \nApplicant was interviewed during the course of a 2019 background investigation. \n(Exhibit 10) Thereafter, on March 9, 2020, after reviewing the available information, the \nDoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThe SOR is similar in form and purpose to a complaint, which is the initial \npleading that starts a civil action; in some states this pleading is known as a petition; \nand in criminal law it is a formal charge accusing a person of an offense. Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct. \nApplicant answered the SOR in April 2020 and again in January 2021. He \nincluded numerous documents with the answers. He requested a decision based on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge. \nOn April 21, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it May 6, 2021. He \ndid not reply to the FORM. \nThe case was initially assigned to me August 3, 2021, but processing of the case \nstopped on or about August 9, 2021, due to a loss of jurisdiction as he was no longer \nsponsored by an employer. The situation changed on about September 16, 2021, when \nthe case was reopened, and it was assigned to me October 8, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 64-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for his job as a security officer for a shipbuilding company. He has \nbeen so employed since July 2018. He has been married since 1992. He and his \nspouse have had the same residence since 1993. His educational background includes \na high school diploma.

The \ndelinquent accounts consist of two collection accounts and three charged-off accounts. \nThe five delinquent accounts are established by documentary evidence included in \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM. (Exhibits 6 and 7). Applicant did not disclose any \ndelinquent financial accounts, or any other derogatory financial matters, in his 2019 \nsecurity clearance application.

The March 2019 credit report shows the account is held by a collection agency. \n(Exhibit 7) In his answers to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had entered into a \nrepayment arrangement to pay $300 monthly beginning in April 2020, and the current \nbalance is $5,880. He did not present proof of payment from the current or original \ncreditor to confirm the payment arrangement or the current balance. I find this account \nis unresolved.  \n \n \nThe third delinquency is a $1,304 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The \nSeptember 2019 credit report shows the debt stems from a credit card account. (Exhibit \n6) In his answers to the SOR, Applicant presented proof of payment as follows: (1) a \n$300 one-time automatic payment in September 2016; (2) a $351 payment via money \norder in September 2014; and (3) a $351 payment via money order in July 2014. The \nthree payments total $1,002. In his January 2021 answer to the SOR, he stated that the \naccount was paid in full as of that day, but he did not present proof of payment from the \ncreditor. I find this account is partially but not fully resolved.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy far the largest delinquency is a $73,687 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nTwo credit reports describe the account as a home equity line of credit, which was \nopened in December 2005, and charged off in December 2017. (Exhibits 6 and 7) In his \nanswers to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had entered into a repayment \narrangement with a law firm to pay $800 monthly beginning in April 2019, and he \npresented documentary proof of an $800 payment in March 2020. In his January 2021 \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that he continues to make the $800 monthly payment, \nand the current balance was $58,887. He did not present proof of payment from the law \nfirm or the original creditor (a large bank) to confirm the payment arrangement or the \ncurrent balance. I find this account is unresolved. \nThe fourth delinquency is a $258 charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In his \nanswers to the SOR, Applicant presented proof of payment made in November 2019. I \nfind this account is resolved. \nThe fifth delinquency is a $64 medical collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In his \nanswers to the SOR, Applicant stated that he paid this debt in November 2016. The \ndebt appears in the March 2019 credit report, but not in the September 2019 credit \nreport. (Exhibits 7 and 6, respectively) He did not present documentary proof of \npayment. Although the debt is minor, I find it is unresolved. \nIn addition to the five delinquencies in the SOR, Applicant settled in full a $890 \ncharged-off revolving account with a bank in April 2019. (Answers to SOR; Exhibit 10) \nThere is also documentation showing Applicant satisfied two money judgments taken by \ncreditors. (Exhibits 8 and 9) The first judgment was obtained in May 2018 for $1,863 \nand satisfied in May 2020. The second was obtained in November 2018 for $1,517 and \nsatisfied in July 2019. Because these three matters were not included in the SOR, I \nhave not considered them as disqualifying matters. But I have considered them under \nthe whole-person concept, as evidence of Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems, and \nas mitigating evidence favorable to Applicant (e.g., repayment of delinquent accounts). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not directly addressed his nondisclosure of delinquent debts in \nresponse to the relevant questions on his security clearance application. During his \nbackground investigation in 2019, he indicated that his overall financial situation was \nstable as he was back to making money and paying bills. (Exhibit 10) He did not \nvolunteer any information when given the opportunity to disclose any financial problems. \nBut when confronted with a number of delinquent accounts, he agreed to them and \ndiscussed those matters. The background investigation does not show that he admitted \ndeliberately or intentionally omitting or concealing his financial problems when he \ncompleted the security clearance application. \nIn the same background investigation, Applicant attributed his financial problems \nand his inability to pay bills to his job loss (via termination) at the shipyard in March \n2016. (Exhibit 10) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1  As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4   \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5  Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I have considered the following disqualifying \ncondition as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant did not disclose delinquent debts when completing his February 2019 \nsecurity clearance application. It\u2019s clear to see that Applicant had delinquent debts that \nhe should have disclosed. But it\u2019s not so clear to see what was in his mind at that time. \nGiven the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that his nondisclosure was a \ndeliberate or intentional omission, concealment, or falsification of his financial history. \nThis matter is decided for Applicant.  \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent:  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nSubstantial evidence shows Applicant has more than $80,000 in collection accounts \nand charged-off accounts, which is not a minor or trivial amount. The disqualifying \nconditions noted above apply. \nAn applicant lives in the real world and can expect real-world problems, such as \na job loss. The security clearance process recognizes that bad things can happen to \ngood people and has a certain tolerance for the possibility of human error and honest \nmistakes. But an applicant is still expected to keep their house in reasonable order. In \nfinancial cases, keeping their house in order includes providing a reasonable amount of \ndocumentation in support of their case to show whatever steps and remedial actions \nthey are taking to resolve their financial problems. The security clearance process, like \nother large bureaucratic institutions such as banks, hospitals, universities, and \ninsurance companies, does not run on word-of-mouth. It runs on documentation. \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems, which are unresolved and ongoing. I have reviewed the mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and conclude none are fully applicable. In particular, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b), concerning circumstances largely beyond one\u2019s \ncontrol, does not apply. Certainly, the job loss in 2016 was a large factor in his financial \nproblems, but the job loss occurred when he was terminated for cause as opposed to a \njob layoff beyond his control. Second, although his claims seem plausible, he has not \nprovided enough supporting documentation to establish his claims of proof of payment \nmade to his various creditors. Accordingly, he does not receive the benefit of mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d). \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 33-year-old material handler for a government contractor since August 2017. Applicant graduated from high school in 2007. Applicant married in 2013, and has three children and one stepchild. He has never held a security clearance.

He was also fired from a job in November 2011, but was immediately hired by another employer. He did not report any period of unemployment on his SCA, but stated in his subject interview that he experienced financial problems due to unemployment. In his SCA, he attributed a past child-support and a credit card debt (not included in the SOR) to having \u201ctwo jobs end up losing one and got behind.\u201d (GE 2, pp. 42 and 44) He also reported a $8,984 delinquent ",

He has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on debts totaling \nabout $23,337 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.l). The debts alleged are supported by the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports and Applicant\u2019s Answer, SCA, and 2018 subject interview summary. Most \nof the debts date back to 2018.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant claims to have incurred his debts as a result of unemployment or \nunderemployment. While his income was likely a significant contributing factor, he has \nnot shown sufficient effort and dedication to resolving debts. The evidence does not \nsufficiently support SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f as two debts for the same amount, but suggests \none may be a duplicate or was paid off. \nApplicant has a long history of financial delinquencies. I am not persuaded that he \nhas control of his finances, has showed financial responsibility, or is diligent about \naddressing his debts while he has the means to do so. In addition, I am unclear as to why \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to pay off debts since being employed in 2017, and substantially ignored \nhis debts until his security eligibility was questioned. \nApplicant chose to have a decision issued on the record, but has done little to \nprovide persuasive mitigating information for my consideration, or to fully explain his \nfinancial history, current financial status, or his inability or unwillingness to meet financial \nobligations. I am not persuaded that Applicant has a handle on all of his debts, has taken \nsufficient action to resolve those that remain, or has shown financial responsibility over \nthe years. As a result, I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant is credited for resolving one account, but he failed to show progress on \nthe others and that continued delinquencies are unlikely to recur. For these reasons, none \nof the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment history. However, he has not provided sufficient evidence to \nshow the resolution of the remaining SOR debts and his overall financial responsibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n5 \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e, and 1.g \u2013 1.l: \n  Subparagraph 1.f: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 50 years old. He married in 2005. He and his wife have a 15-year-old child. He served in the military from 1991 to 2015, when he retired. He has been employed by the same federal contractor since 2015. Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2018. He disclosed 11 delinquent debts. He noted that his debts were due to \u201cincome loss due to job change,\u201d referring to retiring from active duty and his income decreasing. His mortgage loan for rental property had been delinquent due to the tenants not paying their rent. He disclosed the mortgage was satisfied in December 2016 with the sale of the home after the renters were evicted. He fell behind on bills and prioritized paying some over others. Two debts to a military retail store were repaid through garnishment of his military retirement pay from 2015 to 2018. Other debts he noted he was \u201cworking to pay off debt once funds are available\u201d and two he had paid through settlement. Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from October 2018, December 2019, and November 2020 corroborate the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts that total approximately $82,224.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated, but it was verified that it was received \nby the DOD CAF on May 28, 2020.

Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), and Applicant received it on March 21, 2021. He was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items \n2 through 7. (Item 1 is the SOR) Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM or \nobject to the Government\u2019s evidence. All Items are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on May 17, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old. He married in 2005. He and his wife have a 15-year-old \nchild. He served in the military from 1991 to 2015, when he retired. He has been employed \nby the same federal contractor since 2015. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2018. \nHe disclosed 11 delinquent debts. He noted that his debts were due to \u201cincome loss due \nto job change,\u201d referring to retiring from active duty and his income decreasing. His \nmortgage loan for rental property had been delinquent due to the tenants not paying their \nrent. He disclosed the mortgage was satisfied in December 2016 with the sale of the \nhome after the renters were evicted. He fell behind on bills and prioritized paying some \nover others. Two debts to a military retail store were repaid through garnishment of his \nmilitary retirement pay from 2015 to 2018. Other debts he noted he was \u201cworking to pay \noff debt once funds are available\u201d and two he had paid through settlement. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and credit reports from October 2018, December 2019, and November 2020 \ncorroborate the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts that total approximately $82,224. Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to his inability to sell his house after he retired from the \nmilitary and rented it until the tenants stopped paying rent. This, combined with his \nreduction in income after leaving active duty, led to the financial delinquencies in the SOR. \nFollowing the eviction of the tenants and sale of the property, Applicant took a methodical \napproach toward resolving his outstanding debts. (Item 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s November 2020 email and letter, he explained that he had made \ngreat progress toward resolving his delinquent debts, while still meeting his current \nobligations. He estimated having his debts resolved in the next six to eight months. He \nexplained he has always paid his bills on time since he was a teenager. He streamlined \nhis budget, reduced his expenses, contacted his creditors to negotiate payment plans he \ncould afford, and worked a second job. He anticipated being debt-free within the next \nyear. He noted he had paid many debts and had eight remaining of which four were on \npayment plans, and would be fully paid in the next three months. The four remaining debts \nhe was continuing to negotiate with the creditors, but he likely could only pay one at a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntime so he could stay within his budget. He anticipated having all of these debts repaid in \nfull by July 2021. After receiving the FORM in March 2021, Applicant did not provide any \nupdated documents to those he provided in May 2020 with his answer to the SOR to \nshow he had continued to abide by his payment plans and resolved the remaining debts \nas noted below or that he had negotiated settlements for the remaining debts. (Item 2) \nIn December 2019, Applicant received an IRS Form 1099C, cancellation of debt \nfor the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($5,612). (Item 2-Exhibit A) This debt is resolved. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he is in communication with the \ncreditors and negotiating repayment plans for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($3,783), 1.c \n($3,631), 1.e ($1,081), and 1.i ($3,346). Applicant did not provide an update from his May \n2020 answer or November 2020 letter to show the current status of these debts. These \ndebts are unresolved. (Item 2) \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,634) is a collection account. Applicant stated he had a \npayment arrangement with the creditor to pay $60 a month. He provided a document with \nhis answer showing he made consistent monthly payments from July 2019 to April 2020. \nHe did not provide an updated status of any payments made beyond then. He noted in \nhis answer that he had a balance remaining of $1,274. The debt is not resolved. (Item 2-\nExhibit D) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($293) is a collection account. Applicant stated he had a \npayment arrangement with the creditor to pay $11.27 a month. He provided a document \nwith his answer from May 2020 showing he started the payment plan in December 2018. \nThe document shows a balance owed of $225 and the date future payments were due. \nApplicant did not provide additional evidence to show he has continued to make the \nmonthly payments. The debt is unresolved. (Item 2-Exhibit F) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($217) is a collection account. Applicant stated he had a \npayment plan with the creditor to pay $8.36 a month. He provided a document with his \nanswer from May 2020 showing he started the payment plan in December 2018. The \ndocument shows a balance owed of $167.27 and the date future payments were due. \nApplicant did not provide additional evidence to show he has continued to make the \nmonthly payments. The debt is unresolved. (Item 2-Exhibit G) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($215) is a collection account. Applicant stated he had a \npayment plan with the creditor to pay $8.28 a month. He provided a document with his \nanswer from May 2020 showing he started the payment plan in December 2018. The \ndocument shows a balance owed of $165.69 and the date future payments were due. \nApplicant did not provide additional evidence to show he has continued to make the \nmonthly payments. The debt is unresolved. (Item 2-Exhibit H) \nApplicant indicated in his SOR answer that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o (same \nas \u00b6 1.f), \u00b6 1.p (same as \u00b6 1.g), \u00b6 1.q, (same as \u00b6 1.h) were duplicates.

(Item 2-Exhibits J, K, L, M, N). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that he was unable to pay. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a tenant that failed to pay rent and \nincome reduction after retiring from active duty in 2015. One debt was canceled and he \nreceived an IRS Form 1099C. Other debts he settled, some he entered into repayment \nplans, and others remain unresolved. Applicant has made some progress towards \nresolving his delinquent debts. He failed to respond to the FORM, so the latest \ndocumented information on his progress is from May 2020. It is therefore unknown \nwhether he continued to make consistent payments on his payment plans and whether \nhe has paid or negotiated settlements with the remaining creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) therefore does not apply. \nHis tenants failing to pay their rent was beyond his control. His reduction in income after \nretirement should have been expected and was within his control. He has acted \nresponsibly in paying some of his debts and establishing payment plans. His failure to \nprovide current information about the status of his remaining debts leaves me with \nquestions about his continued efforts. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application, but it does \nnot fully mitigate the concerns raised. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. There is some evidence of a good-\nfaith effort to resolve some of his debts through settlements. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these \ndebts. It does not apply to those debts he failed to provide recent information about the \ncurrent status of payment plans and the remaining debts he had not yet paid. Applicant \ndenied all of the debts in the SOR, but did not dispute their legitimacy. He did show that \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthree debts were duplicates and they are resolved in his favor. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply \nto the remaining debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has made progress towards resolving his financial delinquencies. He had \nan opportunity to provide more recent information about the current status of his \nremaining debts, but did not. It is unknown whether he continued to make payments \nthrough payment agreements or if he addressed the remaining delinquent debts alleged. \nApplicant did not meet his burden to document that he has continued to addresss his \ndebts responsibly. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph:   1.a: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs: 1.b-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.j-1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A \nsubsequent security clearance background investigation revealed Applicant had the \nfollowing delinquent debts: a $17,764 charged-off debt as a result of a voluntary car \nrepossession (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Tr. 11-16; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 4); a \n$100 delinquent medical account owed to an unidentified medical creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.b: \nTr. 16-17; Gov 4 at 2); a $221 delinquent medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Tr. 17-19; Gov 5 \nat 3); and it is alleged Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in May 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s dischargeable debts were discharged in July 2005. (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Tr. 20-21; \nGov 6). \nApplicant testified that she is currently more financially stable. She understands \nthe importance of paying her bills on time. She has a much better paying job. She \npreviously struggled financially. She would pay her debts based on priority. She is \ncurrent on all of her credit card accounts. She has a budget and does not exceed her \nliving expenses. (Tr. 24-25) \nThe status of the debts alleged in the SOR are: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: $17,764 charged-off automobile repossession debt: Applicant \npurchased and took out a car loan in 2012. She returned the car in July 2017 because \nshe was having difficulty making payments, partially due to her periods of \nunemployment. The car also needed repairs. Before surrendering the car, Applicant \ntried to re-negotiate the terms of the car loan. She was not eligible for refinancing based \non her credit history. A financial counselor advised her to voluntarily surrender the car. \nShe was unaware that she still owed money after the car loan was charged off. She \nassumed it would only affect her credit rating. She admits to receiving some letters \nregarding the car after returning the car to the dealer.

She believes she paid the debt \nand the debt is no longer alleged in her credit report. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 16-17, \n48; Gov 1-4; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $221 delinquent medical account: Applicant believes this debt is \nrelated to an annual medical screening. The medical office performed an additional \nprocedure without her authorization. She disputed the amount that she was charged for \nthe additional procedure. She decided to resolve the account on August 20, 2021. The \ndebt is resolved. (Tr. 17-19 48-51; AE A at 1-4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Chapter 7 discharge in 2005: Applicant purchased a home in 2005 \nwithout understanding the responsibilities of owning a home. She could not afford the \nmortgage payments and the home went into foreclosure. Her home was eventually \nforeclosed. She does not believe there was a deficiency judgment. Her dischargeable \ndebts were discharged. (Tr. 20-21, 51-53; Gov 6) \nAs a single mother, Applicant struggled to pay her bills. Her financial situation \nhas improved with her current job. She resolved many accounts over the years. She \ndoes not live above her means. She has $8,000 in savings. She purchased her current \ncar, a 2014 model, in 2017 for $15,000. Two weeks ago, the car\u2019s engine broke down, \nresulting in a $5,650 repair bill. Applicant refinanced the car so she could afford the car \nrepairs. The balance owed before the refinance was $11,800. After refinancing, the \nbalance on her auto loan is $17,500. Early in her ownership, she missed two payments, \nbut was able to catch up on the payments. She set up an electronic payment plan and \nher car payments are current. (Tr, 27; 41-44) \nApplicant is current on her state and federal taxes. (Tr. 27) She also has a \n$25,000 student loan, which is currently suspended as a result of the pandemic. (Tr. 46) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct: \nUnder Personal Conduct, the allegations consist of Applicant\u2019s five charges of \nDriving while on a Suspended License. Specifically, the charges include an offense on \nJune 2016 (SOR \u00b6 2.a: Gov 7 at 1); an offense on March 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.b: Gov 8); an \noffense in August 2011 (SOR \u00b6 2.c: Gov 9); an offense in December 2010 (SOR \u00b6 2.d: \nGov 10); and an offense in September 2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.e: Gov 11). \nApplicant states that her license was suspended each time for failing to pay \ntraffic tickets. She admits that she neglected to pay the traffic tickets. Most of the \nsuspensions related to her failure to pay speeding tickets, but one suspension was \nbecause her car insurance policy had expired.

(Tr. 21-24, 54-61)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. The SOR alleges a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in May 2005, two delinquent medical accounts, and a charged-off debt \nrelated to a voluntary car repossession. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in her obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant suffered several periods of unemployment \nbetween July 2014 and January 2016, totaling approximately one year. As a single \nmother, she struggled with her finances. Applicant is more mature and has taken \nresponsibility for her debts. She resolved the two medical accounts. The remaining \ndelinquent account is the charged-off car loan. It is likely Applicant will attempt to \nresolve this account in the future if she is able. She recently suffered another setback \nwhen her current car broke down resulting in significant repairs. While I considered her \nrecent automobile repair expenses, I must give AG \u00b6 20(b) less weight because she has \nnot attempted to resolve the outstanding automobile repossession debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies. Applicant made a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. Applicant resolved other debts well before the SOR was issued. She currently \nlives within her means. She is making every effort that is within her control to resolve \nher accounts. \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b615: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3) applies with regard to Applicant\u2019s pattern of rule violations. \nBetween September 2008 and June 2016, she was charged on five occasions with \nDriving on a Suspended License. \nConcerns are raised about a person who has \nnumerous traffic violations because it indicates an unwillingness to follow rules and \nregulations. In turn, this raises questions about whether the person will be capable of \nfollowing the guidelines for handling and protecting classified information. \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating condition applies in Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has not had a traffic violation in over five years. She admits she \nneglected paying her speeding tickets in the past, but has learned her lesson. All of the \nviolations have been resolved. Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under the \npersonal conduct concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s financial \nstruggles as a single mother as well as her period of unemployment. Her financial \ndecisions in the past resulted in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005. She continued to \nstruggle financially for several years. She addressed the delinquent debts that she was \nable to resolve. While Applicant\u2019s financial situation is not perfect, she has taken steps \nto improve her financial situation. I considered Applicant\u2019s history of being charged with \nDriving While on a Suspended License on five occasions between September 2008 and \nJune 2016. Applicant admits her mistakes and has taken steps to improve her conduct. \nShe has not committed a traffic offense in over five years. Applicant has become more \nresponsible over the past few years. For these reasons, security concerns raised under \nthe Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct Guidelines are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w:   \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

On \nNovember 20, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DCSA CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 6, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing.

He earned an associate degree \nin 1983, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989, and a master\u2019s degree in 2006. He has been \nemployed by a defense contractor as an operations manager in the Information \nTechnology (IT) field since April 2018. He was previously granted a DOD security \nclearance in 2003. He was granted an interim DOD security clearance in August 2017. \n(Item 3; Item 4 at 5; Item 8) \nApplicant was employed by another defense contractor (Employer A) between \nFebruary 2017 and March 2018 in the IT field, first as a network manager and then as a \ntechnical specialist. His work performance was highly regarded. However, he was \nterminated for cause, without eligibility for rehire, because he made threatening \nstatements involving the use of a weapon. (Items 4, 5, 6, 7) \nIn March 2018, Applicant was called into a meeting with two coworkers, one of \nwhom appeared with him in person (Person A) and one of whom appeared via \ntelephone (Person B). The meeting was held in a building that housed both Applicant\u2019s \nemployer and the client for whom he was contracted to work. The meeting was called to \ngain Applicant\u2019s support for forthcoming changes on the project for which he worked. \nApparently, Applicant was unaware of the purpose of the meeting. Before the \nconversation started, Applicant stated: 1) \u201c. . . . so you wanted to talk to me, are you \ngoing to fire me, because if you are I have a gun,\u201d and 2) \u201cI\u2019ve been fired before . . . the \nnext person that fires me better watch out.\u201d At some point during the meeting, another \ncoworker joined the meeting in person (Person C). By the end of the meeting, Applicant \nhad calmed down and voiced his support for the proposed changes. (Item 5) \nUpon further reflection after the meeting, Person A deemed the statements \nApplicant made during the meeting to be a credible threat. In making that determination, \nPerson A considered Applicant\u2019s body language and the fact that he was not laughing \nwhen he made the statements. Person A reported the incident the morning after the \nmeeting to Employer A security personnel.

The investigation (which included \ninterviews of Persons A, B, and C) concluded that the statements Applicant made at the \nmeeting were a \u201cmoderate risk.\u201d As a result, Applicant\u2019s badge access to the building \nwas revoked and local police officers escorted him from the building. He was \nsubsequently banned from returning to the building and terminated from employment. \n(Item 5) \nThe current background investigation on Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance was initiated by the security clearance application he submitted in March \n2017. In connection with his background investigation, he was interviewed by a DOD \nauthorized investigator twice in October 2018 and once in December 2018. During his \nfirst interview, he stated that his reason for leaving Employer A was just wanting to do \nsomething different and that he was not officially reprimanded, suspended or disciplined \nfor misconduct. No further information or details about Applicant\u2019s employment with or \ntermination from Employer A were discussed during his second or third interviews. (Item \n4 at 6, 11) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a concerning \nhis threatening statements and termination from Employer A and asserted \u201cI was falsely \naccused of making threatening comments.\u201d He did not proffer any documentary or other \nevidence in support of his claim. Because the SOR did not include any allegations \nrelated to the statements Applicant made to the investigator during his first interview, I \nwill consider them only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person analysis. (Item 2) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts.

While he made the statements over three years \nago, their security significance is brought current by Applicant\u2019s failure to acknowledge \nor accept responsibility for them.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the factual allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c. through 1.g., and a portion of 1.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a quality assurance inspector with his current employer since March 2018. He previously worked for other employers as a dimensional inspector (November 2011 \u2013 March 2018) and as a helicopter blade technician (June 2006 \u2013 November 2011). He is a 1999 high school graduate. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He has never been married, but has been cohabiting since October 2016.

A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on September 3, 2021, \nand he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, he was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. He received the FORM on September 9, 2021.

He \npreviously worked for other employers as a dimensional inspector (November 2011 \u2013 \nMarch 2018) and as a helicopter blade technician (June 2006 \u2013 November 2011).

In addition, he had seven \ndelinquent accounts at the time the SOR was issued in March 2021. \nOn March 5, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), and he explained the background for his failed \nfilings and delinquent accounts. He acknowledged that he had failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for 2016 and 2017 because of procrastination, and that he \nintended to file his 2018 federal income tax return by April 2019. With regard to his \ndelinquent accounts, he claimed that in 2010 he and a girlfriend had broken up, leaving \nhim with bills that became an issue. Although he contended that he paid his bills at that \ntime, he did so by \u201cmaxing out\u201d all of his credit cards. He makes a better salary from his \nnew employer, and expected to start paying his creditors \u201csoon,\u201d without specifying \nexactly when. He acknowledged that he had no plans to resolve his financial issues. He \ncharacterized his current situation as \u201cgood.\u201d (Item 5, at 10-11) \nIn his response to the first set of interrogatories, he expanded on his explanations. \nHe stated that in order to file his unfiled income tax returns, he needed to find his W-2s \nfrom his previous employer. He was not worried about the failures to file those income \ntax returns because he expected refunds for each year. Although he had indicated to the \nOPM investigator an intent to file his 2018 income tax return by the end of April 2019, he \nfailed to do so, and now he intended to have all of his delinquent tax returns filed by the \nend of 2020. As for the delinquent accounts, he explained that his previous salary was \ninsufficient for him to pay his normal bills and also pay the child support that he was \nrecently ordered to pay. The situation \u201csnowballed\u201d and, while his old bills were not \nforgotten, and he now had a better salary, he was unsure who to talk to about making \npayments. (Item 4, at 6) \nIn addition to his failure to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, \nand 2018, the SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $164,906, \nthat were placed for collection, charged off, or for which there was a repossession, as set \nforth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018, allegations that he admitted, along with the \nallegation that he had not done so until August 2020. While he submitted purported copies \nof his returns, he failed to submit Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \u2013 generated tax account \ntranscripts that were repeated requested of him. (Item 4, at 3; Item 5, at 2; Item 6) While \nApplicant eventually overcame his procrastination in August 2020, and the non-filing issue \nhas essentially been resolved, his failure to do so timely still results in a conclusion that \nthe allegation has been proven. \nNone of the remaining delinquent accounts have yet been addressed by Applicant, \nwith no claimed or verified efforts having been made, and none of them have been \nresolved: SOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a home mortgage that went into foreclosure when the \nbalance owed was $147,471, with a past-due balance of $23,307. (Item 3, at 37; Item 4, \nat 3; Item 5, at 11; Item 7, at 1; and Item 8, at 5) SOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a credit-card account \nwith an unpaid balance of $2,843 that was placed for collection and charged off.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2016, \n2017, and 2018. They were not filed until August 2020, well after the required filing dates. \nIn addition, he had seven delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, charged \noff, or for which there was a repossession, totaling approximately $164,906. He claimed \nthat he was initially unable to pay them off because of insufficient funds, but also claimed \nhe would start doing so when his increased salary with his new employer started in 2018. \nAs of March 9, 2021, the date the SOR was issued, while the tax returns had been finally \nfiled, he had not made any claimed or verified efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b619(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. A debt that became delinquent several \nyears ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The \nnature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s delayed failure to voluntarily and timely \nresolve his delinquent federal income tax issues for several years, as well as his \ncontinuing failure to address his delinquent accounts, despite repeated promises to do \nso, make it rather easy to conclude that they were not infrequent. Furthermore, \nconsidering his continued failure to address the delinquent accounts despite earning what \nhe called an increased salary, they are likely to remain unchanged in the future. Applicant \nattributed his financial issues essentially to his procrastination with respect to his federal \nincome tax returns, his girlfriend breaking up with him, and his child-support requirements. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his federal income tax issues and his inaction regarding his \ndelinquent accounts, leads to a conclusion that his actions or inaction were irresponsible. \nBecause of his repeated failure or refusal to comply with the requests that he \nsubmit IRS-generated tax account transcripts, and only submitted copies of purported \nincome tax returns for the tax years in question, there is little verifiable evidence of those \neventual income tax return filings. \nThe SOR did not allege that Applicant had failed to comply with requests for him \nto furnish the IRS-generated tax account transcripts. Nevertheless, Department Counsel \nargued the significance of his failure to do so. It is essentially a personal conduct or failure \nto comply with the investigation issue. Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \npurposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board.

Applicant\u2019s unalleged failure or refusal \nto submit those tax account transcripts will be considered only for the five purposes listed \nabove. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed his SF 86 in October 2018; underwent his OPM interview in \nMarch 2019; completed his responses to one set of interrogatories in September 2019; \nand completed his responses to another set of interrogatories in August 2020. He \npurportedly filed his federal income tax returns in August 2020. The SOR was issued in \nMarch 2021; and the FORM was issued in August 2021. Each step of the security \nclearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the financial issues \nconfronting him. With respect to his unfiled federal income tax returns, there is little \nverifiable evidence that he took any action to resolve those issues before the second set \nof interrogatories was answered by him. With respect to the delinquent debts, even \nthough he self-reported some of his delinquencies in 2018, and discussed them in March \n2019, he still has taken no claimed actions to resolve them despite repeated promises to \naddress them. Those promises still remain unfulfilled. By failing to do so, he did not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there are some promises, but \nno actual resolution efforts. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. It remains difficult to \ndetermine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nquality assurance inspector with his current employer since March 2018. He previously \nworked for other employers as a dimensional inspector (November 2011 \u2013 March 2018) \nand as a helicopter blade technician (June 2006 \u2013 November 2011). He is a 1999 high \nschool graduate. Applicant candidly acknowledged in his SF 86 that he had continuing \nfederal income tax issues as well as some delinquent accounts. He reportedly eventually \nfiled his federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018 in 2020. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for multiple tax \nyears. Although he was repeatedly requested to submit IRS-generated tax account \ntranscripts to verify that he had actually filed his delinquent income tax returns, he failed \nor refused to do so. He also had seven delinquent accounts, totaling approximately \n$164,906. Although the SOR was issued in March 2021, as of October 2021, when his \nresponse to the FORM was required, he had taken no claimed efforts to address any of \nhis delinquent accounts. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After being unable to make an affirmative finding \nregarding Applicant's security clearance eligibility, the Department of Defense \nCounterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nJune 9, 2021 , detailing security concerns under the guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F).

On July 23, 2021, \nthe Government sent Applicant a copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), the documentary evidence in support of the allegations of the SOR. The FORM \nincluded five items of evidence listed on page 1 and 2 of the FORM. He received the \nFORM on August 5, 2021. The delivery receipt confirms that the SOR was mailed to \nApplicant on July 23, 2021. The receipt also confirms that Applicant received the SOR on \nAugust 5, 2021. Both dates appear to the left and right of Applicant\u2019s signature. Applicant\u2019s \ntwo email addresses appear above the signature line. The FORM recommended he file \na response including objections, or submit explanations or other information within 30 \ndays of receiving the FORM. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response on September 7, 2021. \nThe FORM was assigned to me on October 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR lists two student loan debts totaling $78,501.

There are six remaining \ndelinquent consumer debts identified in SOR 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, totaling \n$8,566. In his answer, Applicant claimed payments were being made to resolve SOR 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, and 1.f. He denied SOR 1d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, contending that these debts \nwere paid or settled. \nApplicant is 34 years old; he married in 2016. He has four children, ages 14, 10, \n8, and 4. He attended college from 2001 to 2005, 2010 to 2012, and August 2012 to the \npresent. Currently, he is working stateside as a cybersecurity analyst. No additional \ninformation is available regarding this employment. His October 2018 e-QIP reflects that \nhe was employed overseas as a technician control II since June 2017. Though he \nindicated he was unemployed from June 2016 to May 2017, he also indicated he was on \nactive duty in the United States Army from September 2008 to December 2016, receiving \nan honorable discharge. Though he claims that he was in college from August 2005 to \nAugust 2008, his earlier college attendance information (Item 3 at 12-14) does not show \nhe was in college during the period. \nSOR 1.a \u2013 This student loan account was opened in June 2014 and transferred \nfor collection in December 2015. (Item 4 at 2) Applicant provided no explanation for \ndenying the delinquent account. He provided no documentation that shows payment \narrangements he claimed he made. \nSOR 1.b \u2013 As with SOR 1.a, this student loan account was opened in June 2014 \nand transferred for collection in October 2015. (Item 4 at 2) As with SOR 1.a, he did not \nexplain why he denied the account, or the steps he took to put payment arrangements in \nplace. His response to the FORM contains a letter dated August 17, 2021, from a student \nloan servicer, indicating that they had accepted a payment plan for an initial payment of \n2 \n\n    \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$985 due in August 2021, then $250 a month thereafter until the balance was paid. There \nis no documentation showing that that any payments were made. (Response to FORM at \n5) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This is a delinquent account with a federal finance agency that \nadministers and manages the accounts of military and civilian employees. (Item 4 at 2) \nThe account was opened in May 2015, and was charged off in June 2015. The current \nstatus of the debt does not preclude the government from selling the debt to a collection \nagency or suing Applicant to obtain a judgment for the outstanding delinquent balance. \nApplicant provided no independent evidence to substantiate his claim that he was making \narrangements to pay the delinquent account. \nSOR 1.d \u2013 This account was opened in May 2015 and charged off a month later. \n(Item 4 at 2) In his response to the FORM, Applicant provided a five-page exhibit \ncontaining four letters from four different collection agencies showing that a specific \naccount was paid or settled. Because none of the account numbers in the two credit \nreports (items 4, 5) match the account numbers in the four different collection letters of \nApplicant\u2019s five-page exhibit, I am unable to determine whether any of the collection \nletters apply to the listed accounts in SOR 1.d (Item 4 at 2), 1.e (Item 4 at 2), 1.g (Item 5 \nat 18), 1.h, (Item 5 at 18) and 1.i. (Response to FORM at 1-4) \nSOR 1.f \u2013 This past-due child support account was opened in May 2014, and \nwas transferred for collection in October 2018. (Item 5 at 5) Applicant indicated in his \nsecurity clearance application that he was making monthly payments, but he furnished no \nevidence to support his claim that payment arrangements, i.e., bank statements or \nstatements from the state child services agency, or cancelled checks, were made to pay \nthe delinquent child support. His unemployment from January 2016 to May 2017 occurred \nover four years ago. The extra interest that Applicant noted in his answer to the SOR, \nusually is added when child support has not been paid or payments are irregular. \nIn sum, while Applicant is credited with paying off or settling four delinquent \naccounts, there is no way to verify these settlement letters apply to any of the accounts \nidentified in SOR 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i. He presented no documented information \nabout the status of the child support account identified in SOR 1.f. Without information \nexplaining his financial habits, there is no way to determine how he manages his financial \nresponsibilities. Since June 2014, Applicant has accumulated more than $118,000 in \ndelinquent student loan debt, child support debt, and consumer debt. (Items 3 and 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \n3 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that he \nadmits or denies. The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a \nfavorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, \nsubstance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as \nit may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \nAn individual\u2019s consumer debt becomes a government concern when credit \nreports show he is not paying his debt according to previously agreed contractual terms \nor court order.   \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems that is substantiated by his June \n2021 answer to the SOR and the 2018 and 2019 credit reports. The total amount of debt \nis more than $118,000. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) does not apply because \nApplicant provided documentation verifying that he paid or settled four debts. The problem \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis that there is no way to prove that any of the paid or settled debts are those listed in the \nSOR. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nThough several listed debts are dated, several others are less than three years \nold. Applicant\u2019s failure to supply evidence of the status of the student loan debt identified \nat SOR 1.a and 1.b, and the delinquent child support debt at SOR 1.f, indicate that his \nfinancial problems will likely continue in the future. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant receives some mitigation for his unanticipated unemployment from \nJanuary 2016 to May 2017. However, he has not presented any evidence to indicate \nemployment disruption since May 2017. He has not provided evidence of unexpected \nmedical problems. Instead of showing signs of regaining control over his financial \nresponsibilities, he has accumulated additional debt in the interim. While he has paid off \nor settled some debts, there is no proof that he has satisfied, or is in a payment plan for \nany of the listed debts. The mitigation that Applicant receives due to the unforeseen \nunemployment is undermined by the absence of documented evidence that shows any of \nthe listed debts were paid or settled. Applicant receives minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) for similar reasons. AG \u00b6 20(c) is unavailable for mitigation as there is no evidence \nof financial counseling to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n        \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 34 years old. He has been married since December 2016, and has \nfour children. He has several college credits but no diploma. He served in the Army from \nSeptember 2008 until his honorable discharge in December 2016. \nWeighing against the favorable evidence of Applicant\u2019s educational background \nand his positive service to the Army, is the large amount of delinquent debt he has \naccumulated with no plan to repay the debt. Under the DOHA Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence, an applicant can overcome the Government\u2019s prima facie case of financial \nproblems by furnishing evidence of a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt reduction through \nrepayment over a reasonable period. See, ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. \n2007). Applicant has produced evidence of debt reduction by payment or settlement of \nfour delinquent debts. But he has not supplied unequivocal evidence that proves he paid \nor settled the listed consumer debt. Nor has he put forth a plan, or taken documented \nsteps in furtherance of the plan, to address the two delinquent student loan debts and the \ndelinquent child support account. Having weighed the evidence from a commonsense \npoint of view, the financial considerations guideline has not been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n` \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:       \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n         Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i:                 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1999 until he was honorably discharged in 2003. He attended college for a period, and he has several certificates. The most recent information available indicates that he has never married, and he has no children. (Items 2, 3) Applicant was arrested in 2003 and charged with felony soliciting a child via computer and sending harmful material to a minor by electronic device. He was convicted of the first offense and sentenced to confinement for one year and probation for three years. He served about eight to nine months in jail. He was also ordered to register as a sex offender. (Items 1-4) Applicant stated in his response to the SOR that he had recently been discharged from the military and was visiting his mother before moving to another state: While I was there, I was on the computer one day chatting with people in Yahoo chatrooms. I was contacted by an officer posing as a 15-year-old teenage girl. I planned to head to a GNC nutrition store at the mall to pick up some protein shakes for my work out later that day. I told who I was speaking with in the chatroom that if she wanted to meet, we could meet for a bit outside of the GNC store.

He has been employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1999 until he was \nhonorably discharged in 2003. He attended college for a period, and he has several \ncertificates. The most recent information available indicates that he has never married, \nand he has no children. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant was arrested in 2003 and charged with felony soliciting a child via \ncomputer and sending harmful material to a minor by electronic device. He was \nconvicted of the first offense and sentenced to confinement for one year and probation \nfor three years. He served about eight to nine months in jail. He was also ordered to \nregister as a sex offender. (Items 1-4) \n \nApplicant stated in his response to the SOR that he had recently been \ndischarged from the military and was visiting his mother before moving to another state: \nWhile I was there, I was on the computer one day chatting with people in \nYahoo chatrooms. I was contacted by an officer posing as a 15-year-old \nteenage girl. I planned to head to a GNC nutrition store at the mall to pick \nup some protein shakes for my work out later that day. I told who I was \nspeaking with in the chatroom that if she wanted to meet, we could meet \nfor a bit outside of the GNC store. Next thing I know I had two plain \nclothes officers grab me and take me to the back of the store where I was \narrested. \nApplicant gave additional facts when he was interviewed for his background \ninvestigation in October 2018. He stated that he smoked marijuana two to three times a \nweek while he was at his mother\u2019s house. The \u201cgirl\u201d (actually a police officer) did not \nhave a profile picture. He gave varying accounts as to her age. He initially stated that he \ndid not know her age; he later stated that he did know her age; and he also stated that \nhe could not recall if he knew her age. He admitted that he sent the girl a video of a \nman\u2019s genitalia. When asked why he pursued the interaction with the girl, he said that \nhe was high and wanted sex. (Item 3) \nApplicant was arrested in January 2007 and charged with violating his probation. \nHe stated that he was stopped by the police while riding his motorcycle, and he did not \nrealize that he was outside the county line in violation of his probation. The judge \ndecided not to revoke his probation and send him to jail. He pleaded guilty in May 2007 \nto misdemeanor reckless driving. He was sentenced to a $230 fine and $68 court costs. \n(Items 1-4) \nApplicant presented a 2013 letter from his current state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s \noffice stating that he was no longer required to register as a sex offender in that state. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe completed extensive psychosexual treatment while he was on probation.

He did not remember if he lied on the application for his current job. During his \nbackground interview in October 2018, he stated that his parents and sister knew about \nhis felony record, but his employer and live-in girlfriend did not. In his response to the \nSOR, he reported that his steady girlfriend of three years knew all about his criminal \nhistory. (Items 1-3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \nApplicant\u2019s behavior that resulted in a conviction of felony soliciting a child via \ncomputer reflected a severe lack of judgment and made him vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, and duress. The above disqualifying conditions have been established. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred more than 18 years ago. He completed \nextensive psychosexual treatment while he was on probation. He is no longer required \nto register as a sex offender in his state. He has a long-time girlfriend and a good job \nthat he loves. \nApplicant gave inconsistent statements as to whether he knew the age of the \n\u201cgirl.\u201d He lied on job applications if the application asked if he was a convicted felon. He \ndid not remember if he lied on the application for his current job. During his background \ninterview in October 2018, he stated that his parents and sister knew about his felony \nrecord, but his employer and live-in girlfriend did not. In his response to the SOR, he \nreported that his steady girlfriend of three years knew all about his criminal history. \nThe stigma that attaches when one is convicted of a sexual offense against a \nchild is not easily cast off. Applicant has attempted to avoid that stigma by withholding \nthe information from potential employers and his current employer. The conduct \ncontinues to serve as a basis for coercion, exploitation, and duress; and it casts doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), \n14(c), and 14(d) are not applicable. AG \u00b6 14(e) is partially applicable. I find that sexual \nbehavior concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n1 See ISCR Case No. 09-03233 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2010). The Appeal Board determined that an \napplicant\u2019s child molestation offense \u201ceven though it occurred long ago, impugn[ed] his trustworthiness \nand good judgment.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant\u2019s felony conviction after his 2003 arrest and his 2007 probation \nviolation establish the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been more than 18 years since Applicant was arrested for the crimes \nagainst a child and more than 14 years since the probation violation. Nonetheless, I \nhave unmitigated concerns under the same rationale discussed in the sexual behavior \nanalysis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct, which included a crime that required him to register \nas a sex offender, reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the sexual behavior \nand criminal conduct guidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for sexual behavior, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to make him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress; \nand it casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find \nthat personal conduct concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the sexual behavior, personal conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He provided an interview (PSI, Item 5) to an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on February 20, 2020. On \nApril 3, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Counterintelligence Security \nAgency (DCSA), issued an SOR detailing security concerns under the guideline for \nfinancial considerations. This case is adjudicated in accordance with Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n1 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) dated June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s undated notarized answer to the SOR was probably submitted in April \n2020 because an attachment to the answer is dated in the same month. The Government \nsent a copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), the Government\u2019s \nevidence in support of the allegations of the SOR, to Applicant on December 22, 2020. \nHe received the FORM on January 13, 2021. The FORM recommended he file objections, \nsubmit additional information or provide explanations within 30 days of receiving the \nFORM. Applicant\u2019s response was due on February 12, 2021. DOHA received no \nresponse. I was assigned the case on March 11, 2021. \nRulings on Evidence \nIn a footnote on the second page of the FORM, the Government advised \nApplicant that he could make corrections to the February 20, 2020 personal subject \ninterview (Item 5, PSI) to improve the exhibit\u2019s clarity and accuracy. Alternatively, he was \nadvised that he could object to the entire PSI on the ground that it was unauthenticated \nby a government witness, and it would not be entered into evidence. Applicant did not \nobject, and the exhibit is admitted into evidence. See, E3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5200.6, \npage 52. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling more than $23,000. In his answer, \nApplicant denied all but the vehicle account set forth in SOR 1.b. He explained that his \nwife lost her employment, causing him a period of uncertainty in providing for his family. \nHe fell behind on some financial obligations but paid them off while restoring others to a \ncurrent status. He and his wife are working and have no health concerns. He held a \nclearance for 24 years while serving in the U.S. Navy. Attached to Applicant\u2019s answer is \na letter dated April 1, 2020, from the vice president and chief counsel of Applicant\u2019s \nemployer indicating that Applicant is considered an essential worker whose job is vital to \nthe national interest. Even in ongoing regional emergency situations, Applicant is required \nto travel to and from work to execute his national defense responsibilities. \nApplicant has been married to his second wife since August 2006. He has four \nsons from both marriages. He was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in January 2003 and \na bachelor\u2019s degree in January 2006. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from July 1986 \nto March 2010, when he received an honorable discharge. He had a security clearance \nfor his entire military career. Following his military service in 2010, Applicant worked in \npest control from June 2011 to June 2018. Later In the same month, he started his present \njob as a logistics specialist for a defense contractor.

Some of the information cited above comes from \nhis e-QIP. Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in October 2012 that was \nconverted to Chapter 7 in September 2013. In February 2014, he received a Chapter 7 \ndischarge of all debts. He denied having any other delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s \nreason for filing were to save his house because his wife had lost her job, leaving him \nresponsible for all household expenses. He was also paying the costs of sending two \nchildren to private school. During the pendency of the first bankruptcy, Applicant removed \nthe car debt (SOR 1.b) from the bankruptcy by signing a reaffirmation agreement in \nOctober 2013, and resumed paying the installment note on the car. None of the delinquent \ndebts listed in the SOR were linked to Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition filed in \nNovember 2014. In addition, the petition was dismissed in July 2015 for inability to \nmaintain plan payments. (Item 3 at 40-41; Item 5 at 3-4; Item 8, Journal Entries 50 through \n52, with attached eight-page Reaffirmation Agreement signed by Applicant in October \n2013; Item 9, Journal Entries 29 through 35) \nSOR 1.a \u2013 This mortgage account was opened in January 2019 and the last \npayment activity on the account was August 2019. The credit bureau reports (CBRs) in \n2019 and 2020 reflect account increased from $3,183 to $16,200. (Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at \n11). Applicant claimed that he was unaware of the account or the company. (Answer to \nSOR) \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This delinquent account is a car loan amounting to $15,122. The debt \nwas not included in Applicant\u2019s February 2014 Chapter 7 discharge because he executed \na Reaffirmation Agreement in October 2013 with the credit union resuming payments on \nthe car. (Item 8, Journal Entries 50 through 52, with attached eight-page Reaffirmation \nAgreement signed by Applicant in October 2013) The CBRs show a charge off of $15,122 \nin November 2018. (Item 4 at 7-8; Item 6 at 2; Item 7, Trade Line debt #2). According to \nApplicant\u2019s explanation provided to the OPM investigator in February 2019, the car was \nrepossessed during the pendency of the first bankruptcy (October 2012 to February 2014) \nso he returned the car to the dealer and began making monthly payments of $350 toward \nan ultimate payoff of the balance due on the car. The term \u201ccharge off\u201d means that the \ndebtor is still obligated to resolve the debt. The information supplied by Applicant in his \nSOR answer validates the delinquent status of this debt. (Item 5 at 5) \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This is a delinquent installment account for the same car in SOR 1.b. \nThe account was opened in January 2016, with the last payment activity on the account \nin June 2019. The October 2019 CBR shows a past due amount of $1,616. (Item 6 at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of the account in February 2019 (Item 5 at 5) and his April 2020 \ndenial of responsibility for the account does not explain why the account still appears in \nthe October 2019 CBR. \n3 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR 1.d \u2013 This is a delinquent collection account ($2,508) with a bank as the \noriginal creditor. The account was opened in March 2016, with the last payment activity \non the account in October 2016. Applicant agreed with the validity of the account \ninformation in February 2019 and requested additional time to speak with his wife. His \nunsupported denial of the account in his April 2020 SOR answer contradicts his earlier \nstatements about the validity of the account and does do not explain why the account \nappears as delinquent in his 2019 credit report. (Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 2) \nSOR 1.e \u2013 This is a delinquent credit-card account ($425) opened in July 2015, \nwith the last payment activity in March 2016. While Applicant claims he has an account \nwith the same credit-card name with no arrears, the account listed in this paragraph of \nthe SOR has a different account number. In the 2020 CBR, one credit card is current and \nthis account as past due. (Item 4 at 8; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at entries 6, 8) \nSOR 1.f \u2013 This is a delinquent cable-television account of $212. In February \n2019, Applicant indicated he refused to pay the bill because the cable company damaged \nhis roof and wall of his house when they installed the cable antenna. But he promised to \npay the account in March 2019 if he could not convince the company to withdraw their \ndelinquent account claim against him. He apparently forgot his February 2019 explanation \nbecause in his April 2020 answer to the SOR, he denied owing the company altogether, \nclaiming that he had returned all the cable equipment. (Item 5 at 4-5; Answer to SOR) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator in February 2019, he \naverred that he was not seeking the assistance of a credit counseling service or a debt \nconsolidation service. It should be noted that Applicant could not file the bankruptcy \nactions in 2012 and 2014 unless he completed the bankruptcy court\u2019s credit counseling \nrequirement. (Item 5 at 4-5; Answer to SOR) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other trust issues \nof personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nManaging one\u2019s finances is generally a private matter between a debtor and his \ncreditors. However, legitimate security concerns are raised when information is \nuncovered showing that the debtor is not paying his bills in a timely manner. If a person \nwho seeks a security clearance demonstrates irresponsibility in mishandling his finances, \nthen there is a probability he may adopt the same kind of irresponsible attitude toward \nsecurity rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying conditions relevant in this case are: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has six delinquent debts totaling a little more than $23,000. He began \naccumulating these debts in March 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nApplicant\u2019s PSI, the Government credit bureau reports, and Applicant\u2019s \nstatements establish the Government\u2019s case under the financial considerations guideline. \nIt is well-settled that negative information within credit bureau reports can establish \nallegations of debt delinquencies. Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion of \nproducing evidence that rebuts or mitigates the Government\u2019s case and meets his burden \nof demonstrating he warrants eligibility for security clearance. \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThough the six SOR delinquent debts have been past due for two to four years, \nwith no substantiating evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial practices in resolving his financial \nobligations, there is no reason to infer or suggest that this financial irresponsibility will not \npersist or recur in the future. Applicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent debt continues \nto cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence to establish that the indebtedness was due to events \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control. He has been consistently employed from June 2011 to the \npresent time. The only connection that the six debts have to the February 2014 Chapter \n7 bankruptcy discharge or July 2015 bankruptcy dismissal is Applicant\u2019s agreement in \nOctober 2013 to reaffirm and pay the balance due on the car debt identified at SOR 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant indicated that he has not participated financial counseling. He may \nhave forgotten about the credit counseling that he was required to complete before he \ncould file his bankruptcy petitions in 2012 and 2014. Because there is no evidence \nshowing a good-faith effort to bring his delinquent debts under control, Applicant receives \nno mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) or 20(c). The court-mandated counseling has had little \nsubsequent effect on how he manages his financial obligations. Significantly, in his \nFebruary 2019 PSI (Item 3), Applicant acknowledged the debt identified in SOR 1.e, and \nindicated he would talk with his wife about the debt. In the same PSI, he promised to pay \nthe SOR 1.f debt by March 2019. Lastly, Applicant still owes the SOR 1.b debt even \nthough the debt is charged off. \n6 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have carefully evaluated the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \ncontext of the entire record. I have considered Applicant\u2019s military service spanning more \nthan 24 years while holding a security clearance. I have examined the attachment to \nApplicant\u2019s answer describing the importance of his position. However, the attachment \ndoes not address his job performance and reputation for judgment, trustworthiness and \nreliability among his colleagues. Having weighed the evidence as a whole, Applicant has \nnot overcome the security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f:   \n\n    \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant access \nto classified information. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 8, \n2020. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibit A at the hearing, which was \nadmitted without objection, and testified on his own behalf. The record then closed. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of this hearing on January 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 50 years old, and married. He has a Bachelor of Science degree. \nApplicant requires access to personally identifiable information in order to perform his \nwork duties. He has been employed by his current employer since 2018 as a Field \nSupport Engineer.

DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has a long history of purchasing and using illegal drugs. This occurred \nfrom 1985 until the present day. Since 2015 Applicant has used marijuana on almost a \ndaily basis, including two days before his hearing. While Applicant may have a medical \nmarijuana card provided by his state, he indicated his knowledge that drug use was \nincompatible with holding a position of trust with the United States. In addition, Applicant \nstated that he intended to continue marijuana use into the future. All of the named \ndisqualifying conditions apply to the facts of this case. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAs stated. Applicant has used marijuana from 1985 onwards. Applicant is a \nsmart, capable, and mature individual. He has knowledge of the Federal laws, rules, \nand regulations prohibiting illegal drug use by individuals attempting to obtain, or \nholding, national security eligibility for access to personally identifiable information. He \nfully intends to continue to use marijuana for what he believes are valid medical \nreasons. Neither of the mitigating conditions apply. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. As stated, Applicant has used \nmarijuana for many years, and evinced a credible intent to continue to use it in the \nfuture. Accordingly, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information, \nunder the whole-person concept. His longstanding drug involvement includes frequent \nand recent misuse of marijuana, which is likely to continue and recur in light of his \nexpressed intentions. The potential for exploitation remains undiminished in light of his \nknowing refusal to comply with applicable Federal laws, rules, and regulations. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \nunder the whole-person concept. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a - c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(AE A-D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2012 through 2015 state income tax returns when they \nwere due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s promises to file the delinquent state income tax returns rang hollow \nuntil they were finally filed in August 2020. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not \nend the discussion. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns when required raises \nquestions about his judgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. \n \nNonetheless, I am satisfied that Applicant has learned a valuable lesson, and \nthat all future returns will be filed on time. Several factors are in Applicant\u2019s favor: he \nfiled all his federal returns on time; he reported his tax issues on his SF 86; he filed his \nreturns for 2016 forward on a timely basis; and he paid the small amount he owed the \nstate. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Clearance is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 26, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national security to grant \nsecurity clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after \nJune 8, 2017. On November 2, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR, denying all of the allegations. She \nrequested a decision without a hearing. On December 21, 2020, Department Counsel prepared a File of \nRelevant Materials (FORM). On January 25, 2021, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, and she was \ninstructed to \n1 \n\nfile any objections, or to supplement the file within 30 days of receipt. She did not file a response. Subsequently, on \nMarch 11, 2021, the case was assigned to me.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 42-year-old woman who has been married since 2018. A previous marriage ended in divorce in \nDecember 2011. (Item 7 at 26) She has a bachelor\u2019s degree, earned in 2000, and two master\u2019s degrees, earned in \n2002 and 2007, respectively. Between 2007 and 2014, she pursued another degree at an online university. (Item 3 at \n11-13) Since 2018, she has been working as an instructional systems designer for a defense contractor. (GE 3 at 14) \nApplicant has 28 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $290,000. Nearly all of them constitute student loans. \nApplicant denied all of the debts, asserting that she has either paid them in full, or is paying them in monthly payment \nplans. She discussed these delinquent debts with an investigative agent during an April 2019 interview. She was given an \nopportunity to provide documentation corroborating her dispute of these delinquencies, and did not do so. (Item 4 at 9) \nShe did not provide any corroborating evidence when she completed her answer to the SOR, and she did not provide any \nevidence substantiating her denials in response to the FORM.  \nApplicant contends that her financial issues began in 2014. (Item 4 at 7) In November of that year, she took \na tropical vacation. (Item 3 at 35) She took another tropical vacation in 2017. (Item 3 at 40) She has not received any \nfinancial counseling. (Item 4 at 9) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive Branch has in regulating access \nto information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department \nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required \nto be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s extensive delinquent debts generate security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n3 \n\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant did not provide any evidence explaining how her debts became out \nof control, nor did she provide any evidence substantiating her contention that they \nhave either been paid or are being paid through payment plans. Under these \ncircumstances, none of the mitigating conditions apply. I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors when I evaluated the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and they do not warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.bb: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n4 \n\n_____________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 48 years old. She has been married to her spouse for 27 years, but last month she filed for divorce. She has two sons, ages 19 and 24. Beginning in about 2014, she attended college one night a week and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2019. Since June 2019, Applicant is employed as a human resources assistant for a DoD contractor. Her annual salary is about $40,000. Her employer requires her to be issued a position of trust to perform specific employment duties.

He handled all of the finances and was the primary wage earner of the household working as a police officer. Her husband\u2019s income did not provide much money for a family of four, and they did not have a monthly budget in place to live within their means. In 2005, they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. They began to experience financial difficulties again after she and her husband separated in 2013. She left with her two sons and was required to obtain food stamps in order to make ends meet. At that time, she was working part time at her sons\u2019 school as a reading aide, which did not provide much income.

(Tr. 10-11, \n28-30, 37; GE 3) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s ten delinquent debts which totaled approximately \n$26,450. The credit reports corroborate the delinquent accounts. The current status of \nthese debts is as follows: (GE 2, GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged a $338 Comcast account referred for collection. Applicant \nadmitted this debt and testified at the hearing that she was in the process of paying this \ndebt, but unforeseen circumstances in her marriage caused her to file for divorce. She \nstated that it was her intention to arrange a payment plan with the creditor after the \nhearing. There is no evidence in the record that shows that this debt is resolved or in \nthe process of being repaid. (Tr. 28-31) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged a $17,583 timeshare account that was charged-off as a bad \ndebt. Applicant admitted this debt occurred a number of years ago. She and her spouse \nattended a timeshare meeting. Her husband believed that they could afford the \ntimeshare, but she was against making the purchase. They had a 30-day cancellation \ngrace period in the purchase contract in the event they changed their minds. She \nbelieved they had cancelled their timeshare purchase within the 30-day period. When \nshe discovered the existing timeshare debt, she confronted her spouse about it. He \ninformed her that the timeshare company had gone out of business. At the hearing she \nadmitted that she is not certain how to resolve this debt, which is the largest debt \nalleged in the SOR. She will eventually address this debt, but she has other debts that \nare considered a higher priority to resolve at the present time. (Tr. 31-32) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged a $129 collection account. Applicant provided documentation \nto show that this account was paid in full. (Tr. 32-33; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged a $106 Comcast account referred for collection. Applicant \nadmitted this debt and testified at the hearing that she was in the process of paying this \ndebt, but circumstances in her marriage caused her to file for divorce earlier than \nplanned. While trying to communicate with the collection agency to arrange a payment \nplan, she received an email response indicating that the collection agency had \ndiscontinued collection efforts and would submit an account deletion request to the \ncredit bureaus. The email communication is in the record, and this account is \nconsidered resolved. (Tr. 44-45; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged a $1,842 Sprint account referred for collection. Applicant \nprovided documentation showing that she paid $1,114.87 of this debt to date, with a \nremaining balance of $736.61.

The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.1 Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.2 An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government.3 An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n1  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n2  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n3 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s ten delinquent debts totaled approximately \n$26,450. The Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6 19(a) (an inability to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating \nconditions is required. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent at various periods during her 27-year \nmarriage.

He did not suitably manage their money, and in 2005 they filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy protection. In 2013, Applicant separated from her husband and moved out of \nthe family home with their two sons. She was required to use food stamps to make ends \nmeet. They reunited in 2014, and she decided to enroll in college and get her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, which she obtained in December 2019. She was hired by her current employer \nin 2019. In June 2021, she moved out of the house and filed for divorce. She is currently \nliving with her parents and using her income to resolve the delinquent accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 year-long separation from her spouse and her recent move out \nof the family home due to a pending divorce contributed to her financial troubles and \nwere circumstances beyond her control. She provided documentation showing that she \ntook responsible action to resolve delinquent debts after she became aware of her \nfinancial issues. She has paid, resolved, or is in the process of paying six out of the ten \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. Although not alleged in the SOR, but brought to \nher attention by Department Counsel, Applicant immediately paid delinquent state taxes \nof $808 after she received notice of this debt. She provided sufficient documentation of \nher payment efforts and the current status of her debts. She has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved and is under control. Overall, Applicant has shown that she is working dutifully \nto be financially responsible, which makes her reliable and trustworthy. Applicant has \nmitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \nApplicant took affirmative action to resolve her financial delinquencies after it was \nbrought to her attention, and her financial issues are currently under control.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant received sexual favors from women at massage parlors on numerous \noccasions over a period of about 13 years. His wife does not know of this conduct. As a \nresult, he is vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise this disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant remains vulnerable to coercion. He produced no evidence of positive \nsteps that would alleviate the risks present from his conduct. Despite agreeing to cease \nsuch conduct in 2008, he continued to accept sexual favors until 2016. This decision \ndemonstrated questionable judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. All are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nApplicant received sexual gratification at massage parlors on multiple occasions. \nHis conduct is arguably criminal and represents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior \nthat reflects a lack of discretion or judgment. It also clearly creates a vulnerability to \ncoercion, as discussed above under Guideline E. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant is 59 years old. He has \nvisited public massage parlors and received sexual gratification from women at the \nparlors on multiple occasions from 2008~2016. His wife still does not know of this \nconduct, which makes him susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress. He has not \nattended any counseling. The fact that the behavior was consensual does not mitigate \nthe security concern about his judgment raised by his conduct. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and D in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nWhile it appears that Applicant is well respected in the workplace (AppXs A~D), \nApplicant demonstrated poor judgment for many years and remains vulnerable to \ncoercion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct, and sexual behavior security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has not taken any further \naction to pay or otherwise resolve this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 44; GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred multiple delinquent debts of which all but two remain unpaid or \nunresolved. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised, except as to SOR \u00b6 1.k, which \nwas not established. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although he recently \nmade one payment toward his medical debts after the SOR was issued, he has chosen \nnot to address his other debts. He resolved his large car repossession debt, but only \nthrough a court-ordered wage garnishment action. He failed to produce evidence showing \nthat recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties by residing in a high cost area and \nbecause he was unemployed for several years following his medical retirement from the \nmilitary due to combat injuries he suffered. Although, it must be pointed out that while he \nwas unemployed, he was receiving approximately $5,000 per month in income from \nvarious disability payments. He also received a lump-sum payment of $100,000, which \nhe admitted that he spent unwisely. These were circumstances beyond his control. \nHowever, he did not act responsibly when he failed to attempt to resolve his debts with \nthe resources he had available to him. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. His track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Additionally, he failed to put forth a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts. His payment of the repossessed car through court-ordered \nwage garnishment does not constitute acting in good faith. He has only made one \npayment toward his medical debts and that was in August 2021. Unfortunately, his actions \nare too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand AG 20(d) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered the tremendous sacrifice Applicant made through his military service \nand his current disabled status. However, I also considered that he has made insufficient \nefforts to resolve his debts even though he had sufficient resources to do so. He has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to question \nhis ability to resolve his debts in the future, particularly because he admitted making poor \nfinancial decisions. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.j, 1.l-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.k: \nFor Applicant  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996. She married in \n1995 and divorced in 2000. She has two children from the marriage, ages 26 and 23. She \nhas a child from another relationship who is 19 years old. She is the president and chief \nexecutive officer of her own company, a small business, since 2009. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-\n17; GE 1) \n \nThe sole allegation in the SOR is that Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes in \nthe amount of $90,875 for tax year 2015. Applicant disputes the allegation. She testified \nthat after filing her 2015 federal income tax return she owed taxes. She stated that she \nruns her business as an \u201cS\u201d corporation and when she files her tax returns the income \nfrom her business is included in her personal income and taxable. When she completed \nher 2015 federal income tax return in 2016, she was unable to pay the tax liability because \nher company had lost a large contract that normally would have generated cash income \nto pay the tax liability. Instead she had a cash flow problem. She made a $5,000 payment \ntoward her 2015 tax debt, but could not pay the whole amount. She testified that at the \ntime she filed the appropriate forms with the IRS to arrange a payment plan. She stated \nshe never received a response from the IRS on her request. She is the sole owner of the \ncompany and is personally responsible for all taxes owed, personal and payroll. (Tr. 18-\n20, 26) \nApplicant provided a spreadsheet indicating the payments she made to the IRS to \nbe applied to her 2015 tax debt. It shows that in 2016 she made a $5,000 payment and \nher 2016 tax refund of $1,863 was applied to the 2015 debt. Applicant testified that in \nNovember 2017 she made an electronic payment of $71,340 to the IRS for her 2015 \npersonal income tax debt. At the time, she believed that this satisfied her 2015 tax debt \nand it was resolved. However, she testified that this payment was applied to her \ncompany\u2019s payroll tax account. Because it was not applied to her personal income tax \ndebt, penalties and interest continued to accrue. She provided a copy of her letter to the \nIRS from April 2020 requesting the IRS reallocate the payment to her personal account \ninstead of her payroll account, which she believes was erroneous. The letter also \nrequested that because she believed the IRS made an error that penalties and interest \nbe waived. She submitted the letter as an Offer in Compromise (OIC).

A federal tax lien for $65,638 was entered in August 2017. \n(Tr. 20, 26, 28-32, 38, 45; GE 5; AE A) \nApplicant testified that she was late in paying her payroll taxes at the time, but they \nwere paid. The $71,340 she paid was applied to the penalties and interest that had \naccrued for the payroll taxes. She said she paid the payroll taxes, but on the wrong day, \nhence accruing penalties and interest. (Tr. 20, 26, 28-32, 38, 45; GE 5; AE A) \nApplicant testified that she was proactive in working with a local IRS agent to \nnegotiate a payment plan and pay the tax owed. Applicant said that the local IRS agent \nwould not provide a letter attesting to Applicant\u2019s attempts to resolve the issues because \nit was against IRS policy to do so. Applicant requested the IRS assign a case manager \nto address the problems with her case and correct the allocation. She was advised that \none has not been assigned to-date and has been delayed due to the pandemic. Applicant \nnoted her frustration because she believed the local IRS agent could see that Applicant \nhad made payments, but could not make changes until a case manager was assigned \nand it went through the IRS review process. (Tr. 18, 21, 23-27 GE 6) \nApplicant admitted that she did not timely pay her 2015 federal income taxes due \nto corporate financial issues, but she has paid the debt. She understands the importance \nof paying her taxes and debts on time. The unexpected loss of a large contract created a \ncash flow problem, and she was unable to pay the large tax debt on time. She takes full \nresponsibility for her tax debts and explained she did the best she could at the time. She \nfurther testified that in 2016 when she realized she was unable to fully pay the 2015 tax \ndebt, she contacted her corporate attorney who advised her that the fees associated with \nhis service likely would be considerable due to the delays normally associated with \ndealing with the IRS. He recommended that she deal directly with the IRS. (Tr. 26, 37, \n50-51) \nOn her February 2019 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed \nher IRS debt and that she had requested a payment plan with the IRS, but was waiting \nfor a response. During her April 2019 background investigation she also disclosed this \ninformation and circumstances regarding her tax debt. (GE 1, 7) \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 IRS tax transcript shows the $5,000 payment in October 2016 \nwhen she filed her tax return and her 2016 tax year refund that was applied to her debt. \nA refund of $39,028 from tax year 2019 was applied to the debt. The transcript reflects \nthat in March 2021, Applicant submitted an offer in compromise to the IRS. No response \nto date was reflected in the transcript. Three payments of $15,000 were made in May, \nJune, and August 2021. The transcript reflects a balance owed of $11,196. Applicant also \nprovided a copy of a $25,000 check to the IRS from February 2021. She stated that she \nrequested the IRS apply a portion of the amount to satisfy any remaining balance owed \nfor tax year 2015. Applicant stated in her post-hearing letter that she believed her \npayments should satisfy her 2015 tax debt. She believes she should have a credit in her \naccount based on her payments to the IRS. She was advised by the IRS that release of \nthe lien could take up to 60 days.

Applicant believes that had the $71,328 been applied to her \npersonal income tax account and not payroll, she would not have accrued significant \npenalties and interest. Regardless of how it was applied, Applicant was equally \nresponsible for both. The IRS decides which delinquent account to apply payments to. \n(Tr. 42-44, 47, 49) \nA character letter from a business associate of Applicant\u2019s describes her as a \nresilient leader who openly communicates with clients. There are no delinquencies or \npast-due debts reflected in Applicant\u2019s March 2019 and February 2020 credit reports. (GE \n3, 4; AE D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely pay her 2015 federal income taxes. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax problem began when she was unable to timely pay a large tax debt \nowed because her business lost a lucrative contract, resulting in a cash flow problem. \nThis was exacerbated when a payment to resolve the tax debt was applied to her payroll \ntaxes instead of her personal income taxes. It is noted that she owed penalties and \ninterest due to a late payment on her payroll taxes at the time. So although Applicant \nintended that her payment be applied to her personal income tax debt, late fees were \nowed, so it was not erroneous on the part of the IRS to apply it to them. But it may have \ncaused additional penalties and interest to accrue on her personal taxes. \nApplicant has made independent payments and subsequent tax years\u2019 refunds \nhave been applied to the tax debt. I found her testimony credible in that she has been \nattempting to resolve the tax debt and has not ignored the problem. She disclosed the \nissue on both her SCA and during her background interview. The evidence supports that \nthis aberration occurred under unique circumstances and it is unlikely to recur in the \nfuture. It does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nThe loss of a large contract impacted Applicant\u2019s cash flow and her ability to timely \npay her income taxes. This condition was beyond her control as she did not anticipate \nlosing the contract or the income associated with it.

She was personally responsible to pay these \ntaxes. She failed to timely do so. Her failure to timely pay her payroll tax was not beyond \nher control. The IRS applied her payment to her payroll tax debt. She has subsequently \nprovided evidence to show she has made payments to resolve the personal income tax \ndebt. The balance owed as of August 31, 2021, reflected on her 2015 tax transcript, is \n$11,196. I am confident Applicant will resolve the remaining balance timely. There is \nevidence to conclude that once Applicant realized the payment was applied to the payroll \ntax penalties and interest, she acted responsibly in addressing the personal income tax \ndebt. I found her testimony credible that despite her efforts to engage the IRS and \nexpedite the process she was unsuccessful. However, I find she did not act responsibly \nin failing to timely pay her payroll taxes, which she is personally responsible to pay. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant sought financial counseling, which in the future it \nmay behoove her to have an experienced tax accountant involved in the process. I find \nthere is evidence that the problem is being resolved and is under control. I find she has \ninitiated good-faith efforts to pay her tax debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) partially applies and 20(d) \napplies. \nAlthough there is not an approved payment plan in place with the IRS, the evidence \nsupports that Applicant has made significant payments to resolve the tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(g) \nhas some application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to timely pay her 2015 income taxes. She has taken significant \nsteps to resolve the debt. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

He has never applied for a security clearance before, and has no military \nservice. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n(See, \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR dated February 22, 2021.) \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant has an extensive history of illegal drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, including two narcotic-related arrests. His illegal drug use includes cocaine, \nmarijuana, and crystal methamphetamine, at various times, beginning in about January \n1987, and continuing until November 2017. He has also purchased cocaine from about \nMay 2007 to November 2017. \nIn April 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a Narcotic \nControlled Substance. Applicant cannot recall the particulars of this arrest and charge, \nbut he does not deny that it occurred. \nIn January 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a \nNarcotic Controlled Substance. \nApplicant explained that he was in possession of \nparaphernalia and not drugs. Applicant was with his girlfriend, and was driving a truck \nwith no license plates. He took his girlfriend out to dinner, and on the way home they \nwere stopped by the police. Applicant gave the officer permission to search the truck, \nand they found a \u201cbullet,\u201d a plastic paraphernalia storage device, shaped like a bullet, \nthat is used to store narcotics. Applicant stated that he does not know why it was in his \nvehicle, since at the time, he was clean and sober. The officer also found a baggie with \ncocaine in it. Applicant was arrested. Applicant pled no contest to the charge of \nPossession of a Narcotic. \nApplicant was sentenced to pay court cost, fines, and \ncomplete community service, attend Narcotic Anonymous meetings, and take \nsubstance abuse courses through a court-required program. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn October 2017, Applicant failed a random drug test administered by his then \nemployer.

(Government Exhibit 2, and Tr. pp. 34 and 43.) \nApplicant states that he has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug in the future. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) \nGuideline J:  Criminal Conduct  \nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct creates doubt about his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It also calls into question his ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nIn addition to his illegal drug involvement, Applicant has an extensive criminal \nhistory involving a number of alcohol-related arrests. \nIn about March 2001, Applicant was arrested the first time and charged with \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs (DUI.) \nApplicant was convicted and \nsentenced to three years probation. \nIn about September 2006, Applicant was arrested a second time and charged \nwith DUI. Applicant had been out with his girlfriend, shooting pool and drinking. As they \nleft the bar, Applicant did not have his seatbelt on. \nAs he drove away from the stop \nlight, he was pulled over by the police. The officer smelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath \nand administered the field sobriety test and the breathalyzer. Applicant failed the tests \nand was arrested and taken into custody. At court, Applicant pled no contest, and was \nsentenced to pay court cost, fines, and placed on probation for 36 months. \nIn about September 2012, Applicant was arrested a third time and charged with \nHit and Run, Property Damage. Applicant had been consuming beer at a local bar for \nabout five hours prior to the car accident that led to the Hit and Run, Property Damage \ncharge. He got into a verbal altercation with another patron. When he was leaving the \nbar at about midnight, he was concerned that he may be followed by the individuals who \nwere arguing with him. As he left the bar, Applicant was intoxicated and was not in \ncontrol or paying attention while driving. Applicant side swiped a parked vehicle on the \ncurb. He made it home, and had no encounter with police. Several days passed, and \nApplicant felt bad about what had happened, and decided to call the police. Applicant \nwas advised to make an in-person report at the local police precinct. \nApplicant \ncomplied, and was arrested for and charged with Hit and Run, Property Damage. \nApplicant was sentenced to pay restitution, was placed on 36 months probation, \nrequired to pay court costs, and fines, and required to do 100 hours of community \nservice. \nIn about December 2013, Applicant was arrested a fourth time and charged with \nDUI Alcohol/Drugs. Applicant had two beers over a four hour period while at a car \nshow. Applicant then left and went to a bar where he consumed six to seven beers over \na two hour period. When he left the bar, he peeled out of the parking lot, and launched \ninto traffic at an excessive speed, and was pulled over by the police. \nApplicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunderwent a field sobriety test and breathalyzer and failed.

Due to overcrowded facilities, he served only 3 days in jail, and was let \ngo.  An ignition lock was placed on his vehicle. \nThe SOR alleges that in about March 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith DUI. This was not an additional arrest. Apparently on this date, Applicant was \nconvicted of the incident that occurred on December 2013. \nInformation set forth above under Guideline H is also adjudicated under this \nguideline. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nApplicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol abuse leading to questionable judgment, \nand the failure to control impulses, raises questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant began consuming alcohol after graduating from high school. By age \ntwenty-one he was drinking every weekend and consuming between eight and twelve \nbeers on the weekends. Applicant would rarely drink alcohol during the weekdays. \nApplicant explained that he would frequently go \u201cclubbing\u201d where he would dance and \ndrink. \nAs time passed, Applicant\u2019s drinking increased to the point where he was \nregularly consuming between twelve to eighteen beers on the weekends. When his \ndaughter was born, he slowed his drinking down for a period, but he has never tried to \nstop drinking completely. (Tr. p. 64.) Applicant does not believe that he has an alcohol \nproblem. He explained that his goal is to stop drinking completely, but he is not there \nyet. (Tr. pp. 61-66.) \nApplicant has never attended an alcohol rehabilitation program. He does not and \nhas never attended Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous voluntarily. He has \nonly completed the court ordered alcohol education courses and counseling related to \nthe sentencing imposed by the court for his violations. Applicant is currently working \nwith his pastor who is counseling him, and encouraging him to get baptized, which the \npastor believes will gradually help to improve other areas of Applicant\u2019s life. Applicant \nstates that he no longer drinks and drives. Now, he only drinks at home at dinner. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter has told him more than once that she does not like him to drink \nalcohol. She has asked him not to drink, especially on her upcoming quinceneara. (Tr. \np. 67.)   \nApplicant is involved in his church, and plans to get deeper into his faith and \ncontinue to improve himself. He is embarrassed by his past misconduct. He believes \nthat it has taken him some time for him to get his head straighten out. He admits that \nhe has had an attitude problem. Now, instead of abusing alcohol and drugs, he spends \ntime with his family.

Applicant works a lot of overtime to stay \nbusy and realizes that when he stays busy, he stays out of trouble. \nInformation set forth above under Guideline J is also adjudicated under this \nguideline. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 sets forth three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Spanning over a thirty year \nperiod, from 1987 to November 2017, Applicant abused illegal drugs, including cocaine, \nmarijuana, or crystal methamphetamine at various times. Applicant has not shown the \nrequisite good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for \naccess to classified information. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted \nor convicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Neither of the conditions are applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement. \nApplicant violated both Federal and state law by using, possessing and \npurchasing illegal drugs. Cocaine and alcohol were Applicant\u2019s drugs of choice. He \nstated that he has used cocaine between May 2007 and November 2017 about 100 \ntimes. He used marijuana between February 1987 and March 2015, mainly in high \nschool, and a few times since then. He also used crystal methamphetamine on three \noccasions in 2007 while at a party. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal police record reflects at least two drug-related arrests for \nPossession of Narcotics, in April 2002, and January 2005. In addition to his narcotic-\nrelated arrests, Applicant has been arrested on four occasions for DUI, and one arrest \nfor Hit and Run/Property Damage. The most recent of these arrests occurred in March \n2013. Applicant stated that the conviction for the 2013 arrest and charge occurred in \n2014, and there was no evidence presented to the contrary. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates poor judgment, immaturity and a total \ndisregard for the law. This is inexcusable. Applicant has not established that he is \nsufficiently reliable and trustworthy to access classified information. \nHis extensive \nillegal drug use and his arrests for possession of controlled substances gives rise to \nserious concerns about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, both because of \nthe nature of the offenses, and the circumstances surrounding the offenses. \nThe \nbefore-mentioned disqualifying conditions have been established and are not mitigated. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(b) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual was diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \nConcerning his alcohol abuse, the evidence shows that Applicant incurred at \nleast four arrests and charges for DUI, and one Hit and Run, Property Damage charge. \nThese incidents raise serious security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern  of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear  and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant failed to introduce sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. Applicant has a \nlong pattern of abusive addictive behavior. Whether it has been with illegal narcotics or \nwith alcohol, he has abused these substances for many years, and they have caused \nhim many problems with law enforcement. Although it has not been determined if he is \nan alcoholic or is alcohol dependent, he has had at least five alcohol-related arrests \naway from work, the most recent one occurred as recently as 2013.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, J and G in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and analysis \nset forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that \nhe meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, \nCriminal Conduct, and Alcohol Consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e. \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f. \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant explained that he returned to Turkey in March 1991, and again in May \n1993, because he was holding a green card at the time, and was required to complete a \ntwo-month military training obligation to be able to maintain his Turkish citizenship. \nFollowing this, he worked for the Turkish government at the Ministry of Defense as a \nproject engineer, for a year and a half or two.  At this point, Applicant wanted to return to \nthe United States for his graduate studies. When he returned to the United States he \ncompleted his Master\u2019s degree.  Since 1995, Applicant has only been back to Turkey on \ntwo occasions in 2004, and in 2005 when he took his wife and daughter for a three-\nweek summer vacation. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 82 years old and is a citizen and resident of Turkey. She \nlives in Istanbul in the winter, and near the coast in the summer. She has always been \na homemaker and has never worked outside of the home. Applicant maintains regular \ncontact with his parents in Turkey. He speaks to his mother once every two weeks to a \nmonth, and normally discusses her health situation. Due to Covid, Applicant has been \nin contact more frequently, lately. Applicant normally contacts her through \u201cWhatsApp,\u201d \na telephone service. The last time he spoke to his mother in person was in 2011 when \nshe visited the United States. (Tr. p. 33.) \nApplicant\u2019s father is 85 years old and is also a citizen and resident of Turkey. \nAfter finishing his studies in Turkey, he married Applicant\u2019s mother. They were from the \nsame town in Turkey. Applicant\u2019s father was employed as a mechanical engineer for \nmany years, and then owned a small business. He did consulting work for the Turkish \ngovernment. \n(Tr. p. 34.) \nHe is now retired. \nApplicant states that his father\u2019s \nbackground is in the steel industry, but he worked as a consultant managing a leather \nprocessing factory, converting animal hides to leather with chemicals from the factory. \n(Tr. p. 35.)  Applicant\u2019s father also served in the Turkish military. (Tr. p. 35.)  Applicant\u2019s \nfather is now hard-of-hearing. It is difficult for Applicant to speak to him over the \ntelephone. Instead, Applicant talks to his mother, and she communicates what he says \nto his father. Applicant last saw his father in person in 2011 when they visited the \nUnited States. \nApplicant\u2019s sister is also a citizen and resident of Turkey. She is 58 years old. \nShe takes care of Applicant\u2019s parents. She is divorced and retired. She used to work \nfor several banks. At one point, she worked for a private bank, which may later have \nbecome a government bank, Applicant is not sure. Her background is in chemistry. \nShe also speaks French and English. The last position she held was that of a foreign \ncorrespondent. Applicant speaks with his sister less frequently than with his parents. \nHe speaks to his sister once every two months or so to discuss their parent\u2019s health. \nApplicant last saw his sister in person when she visited the U.S. with his parents in \n2011. (Tr. pp. 38 \u2013 39 and 42.) \nApplicant\u2019s father knows that Applicant works for a space company with satellites \nand space technology. His mother is not so aware. She is not an engineer, nor is she \neducated. She does not know what the Applicant does for a living. Applicant\u2019s sister \n3 \n\n \nknows that Applicant is an engineer, and that he works for a space company.  None of \nApplicant\u2019s family members know about his security clearance.  Applicant provides no \nfinancial support to his family in Turkey.  His parents and sister each receive retirement \nbenefits from the government in Turkey and own their own homes.

His parents own an apartment in Instanbul, some land \nfrom Applicant\u2019s grandfather in the countryside, and some olive trees, but Applicant\u2019s \nsister will inherit those assets upon their death. \nApplicant states that he continues to pay attention to political events in Turkey. \nHe is very saddened by what is happening with the lack of democracy there. He is not \nafraid for his parents or sister\u2019s safety in Turkey because they are private citizens who \nlive a decent common people\u2019s life. They keep to themselves, and are not involved in \nany activities that would expose them to problems. \nApplicant has received a number of awards and commendations for his excellent \nperformance on the job and outstanding work product within his group or team. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D-1, D-2 and D-3.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance review for the period from January 1, 2020, through \nJune 30, 2020, is favorable and reflects his work performance as excellent. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit E.) \nLetters of recommendation from upper management, professional colleagues \nand associates, all acknowledge Applicant\u2019s unique skills and talent that he provides the \ncompany.  He has over 20 years of experience and has shown expressive career \ngrowth, in a variety of aerospace systems and platforms through all phases of \ndevelopment and deployment.  Applicant has built a reputation as one of the top \nreliability engineers with dedication, hard work, loyalty to the U.S. Government and \nsupport across the enterprise.  His level of expertise and contribution is recognized not \nonly by this company, but also by colleagues in the industry.  Applicant is considered an \ninvaluable asset and highly recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits F and G.)      \nI have taken administrative notice of background information concerning the \ncountry of Turkey. Turkey is a constitutional republic with an executive presidential \nsystem and a 600-seat parliament. The U.S.-Turkey relationship dates back to 1831, \nwhen the Unites States established diplomatic relations with the Ottomar Empire. Over \nthe years, the U.S. has been committed to emphasizing the importance of the Turkish \ngovernment\u2019s adherence to policies and actions that build public trust in the country\u2019s \ndemocracy institutions and the rule of law, as well as upholding human rights \ncommitments. In recent years, democracy in Turkey has continued to deteriorate. \nPresident Erdogan has ruled Turkey since 2003, and during that time has expanded his \ncontrol over Turkey and its institutions. \nU.S. and European Union officials have \nexpressed a number of concerns about authoritarian governance and erosion of rule of \n4 \n\n \nlaw and civil liberties in Turkey.  Turkey is a member of the UN, NATO, and the Global \nCoalition to Defeat ISIS.  However, due to Turkey\u2019s regional ambitions and a distrust of \nthe United States, the growing authoritarianism of Turkey\u2019s leaders are complicating the \nbilateral relationship and make Turkey more willing to challenge U.S. regional goals.  \nBesides Covid restrictions, travelers are to exercise increased caution due to terrorism \nand arbitrary detentions.  There are high-threat locations for terrorism in Turkey directed \nat affecting official U.S. Government interests, western tourists and expatriates.  Turkey \nis a source of transit for foreign terrorist fighters seeking to join ISIS and other terrorist \ngroups fighting in Syria and Iraq.  ISIS and ISIS offshoot organizations have a \nsignificant presence in northern Syria, and along portions of the Turkish/Syrian border.  \nThe Kurdistan People\u2019s Congress (also Kongra Gel, KGK; and Kurdistand Worker\u2019s \nParty, PKK) has been the most active terrorist organization in Turkey, targeting Turkish \ngovernment facilities and infrastructure. Human Rights and fundamental freedoms \nviolations and a compromised rule of law has resulted in many arbitrary killings, torture, \ndetention of tens of thousands of persons including former opposition members of \nparliament, lawyers, journalists, foreign citizens, elected officials, and employees of the \nU.S. Mission.  There are severe restrictions on freedom of expression, threats and \nviolence toward judicial independence, the press, unjustified arrests or criminal \nprosecutions for criticizing government policies or officials.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 7 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns.  Three disqualifying conditions may apply: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S. that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members include his mother, father, and sister. They \nare citizens and residents of Turkey. Applicant and his father both served in the Turkish \nmilitary and both have worked for the Turkish government. \nDespite the fact that \nApplicant has become an American citizen and has established his permanent home in \nthe U. S., he Applicant maintains regular contact with his parents and sister in Turkey. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign connection with Turkey raises some serious security \nconcerns. Applicant is a target to be threatened or influenced or placed in a situation \nthat may manipulate or induce him to help a foreign person or foreign government in a \nway that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests. Applicant has subjected himself to a \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest from \nhis connections with his relatives in Turkey. Under the particular circumstances here, \nthe risk-benefit analysis is applicable, and this contact poses a security risk to the U.S. \ngovernment that is not necessary. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 8 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of them apply to Applicant: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, the individual \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirement \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAfter moving to the United States, Applicant continued to maintain and nurture \nhis relationship with the country of Turkey, by serving in their military and by working for \ntheir government. He has also continued to maintain close contact with his family in \nTurkey. Full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has not been established. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign relationships poses a heightened security risk. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s strong familial ties in Turkey and foreign connections pose a \nsignificant risk to the U.S. government. Under the particular circumstances of this case, \nthis regular ongoing contact with these foreign nationals creates an unnecessary \nsecurity risk not worth the benefit to the U.S. government. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINT APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 30-year-old analyst, employed by a government contractor since \nAugust 2018. She reported being unemployed from March to May 2018, and December \n2017 to January 2018. She graduated from high school in 2009, and earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2013.

Applicant admitted the student loan debt allegations, and denied \nthe tax debt. She provided no explanations with her answer or any documentary evidence \nin mitigation. Applicant\u2019s public trust application and credit reports support the SOR \nallegations. \nIn her public trust application, Applicant listed that she failed to pay 2017 state \nincome taxes for $1,260. She noted that she was waiting for a tax refund from another \nstate before she paid the state tax debt. She also noted that she was \u201cin contact with the \nIRS and have yet to hear back.\u201d Presumably, Applicant was speaking of the state tax \nauthority to whom she owes the debt, not the Federal agency. In addition, Applicant noted \nthat she owed about $65,000 in student loans since 2013. She stated that she was \n\u201cworking on getting out or deferment, then paying on my student loans.\u201d She also stated \nthat \u201cI am currently paying on my student loans do not know the physical address to which \nI owe my student loans to.\u201d \nSince submitting her Answer to the SOR, no further information has been provided \ndespite the Department Counsel\u2019s notation of the absence of mitigating evidence in the \nFORM. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG\n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present\nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue\neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying conditions above. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held that trustworthiness requirements \ngenerally include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and a sense of his or \nher legal obligations. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a \nproblem with abiding by well-established government rules and regulations. Voluntary \ncompliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay her state income taxes from tax year 2017 as required \nraises questions about her judgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. \nNo explanation or evidence of attempts to resolve the debt were provided. In addition, \nApplicant failed to provide any explanation for her unresolved student loan debts, or \nefforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns. \nThere is a paucity of persuasive evidence regarding the debts, Applicant\u2019s financial \nhistory, and her current financial status. Applicant choose to have a decision issued on \nthe record, but has done little to provide mitigating information for my consideration. In \naddition, Applicant has an employment history that belies her inability or unwillingness to \npay satisfy her financial obligations. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record of action taken to resolve the debts. \nAdditionally, there is no evidence of financial counseling or satisfactory evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status. I am not persuaded that Applicant has a handle on \nher debts, has taken sufficient action to resolve them, or has shown financial responsibility \nover the years. As a result and without more documentary evidence, I remain doubtful \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Subparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nThe administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F, in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent employment status and past periods of unemployment. However, Applicant has \nnot provided evidence to show the resolution of the SOR debts and her overall financial \nresponsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

(Item 3.)  On April 30, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.)  The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in July 6, 2020. He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  (Item 2.)  On \nNovember 23, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing seven exhibits, was \n\n \n2 \n \nsent to the Applicant and received on December 8, 2020.  The FORM notified Applicant \nthat he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  Applicant \nresponded to the FORM on January 4, 2021, and January 11, 2012, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A makes an objection to Government\u2019s Item 5.  Government\u2019s Item 5 is \ninadmissible.  It will not be considered or cited as evidence against Applicant\u2019s interest \nin this case.  It is the summary of an unsworn interview of Applicant conducted by an \ninterviewer from the Office of Personnel Management on February 13, 2019 and March \n26, 2019.  Applicant did not adopt it as his own statement, or otherwise certify it to be \naccurate.  Under Directive, \u00b6 E3.120, this Report of Investigation summary is \ninadmissible against Applicant\u2019s interest in the absence of an authenticating witness.  \nSee Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 5.  In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 5 is also \ncumulative.  The Government replied to Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM dated \nFebruary 4, 2021, which was admitted without objection.  DOHA assigned the case to \nme on February 19, 2021.  Items 1 through 4 and 6 and 7 are admitted into evidence \nand hereinafter referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4 and 6 and 7.      \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 57 years old.  He studied Political Science, History and Spanish at a \nUniversity and obtained his Bachelor degree.  He then received his Juris Doctor from \nanother University, and was selected for the American Criminal Law Review.  Additional \nstudies include post-graduate coursework in counterintelligence at the Institute of World \nPolitics.  He is a member in good standing of the bars of Maryland, the U.S. District \nCourt of Maryland and the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.        \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.   \n  \nThe SOR identified a single allegation under this guideline concerning Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, 2016, \nand 2017.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits this allegation.  (Government \nExhibit 2.)   \n \nApplicant admits that he procrastinated and did file the Federal and state income \ntax returns in question in a timely fashion.  It appears from his argument that his pride \nkept him from seeking help to get these income taxes filed on time.  Applicant \nerroneously assumed that since he was an attorney, a high achiever, and a \nperfectionist, he should be able to figure out how to properly file his income tax returns.  \nHe submits that he had problems determining the basis for certain stocks he sold, and \n\n \n3 \n \nsince 2009, he experienced wide fluctuations in his salary while receiving self-\nemployment income.  His record keeping was disorganized causing even further \nfrustration, and he fell behind on his income tax filings.  He states that he tried and \nstruggled to do his income taxes on his own but was not successful.  He realized, at \nsome point, that his income tax returns were not simple, but required complicated tax \ncalculations that he was not accustomed to or sufficiently educated to perform \neffectively.  Instead of hiring a professional tax preparer, he ignored the problem.  It was \nnot until March or April 2019, that Applicant hired an accountant to address his income \ntax problems.  Applicant\u2019s overdue Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2016 and 2017 were not filed until January 8 and January 13, 2020.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits K and L, submitted with his response to the SOR.)  Applicant\u2019s Federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 were not filed until May 18 and \nMay 21, 2020.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, submitted with his response to the SOR.)       \n  \nApplicant offers in mitigation that he filed his 2018 and 2019 Federal and state \nincome tax returns on time given the extensions permitted by the taxing authorities \nbecause of the COVID pandemic.  These returns were filed on May 22, 2020.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N, submitted with his response to the SOR.)   \n \nCharacter references from professional associates, friends and colleagues of the \nApplicant attest to his good character, trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to abide by \nthe laws.  (Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d  The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.  \n \n  \nApplicant did not abide by the tax laws.  He failed to file his Federal and state \nincome tax returns for a number of years.  The failure of Applicant to act in a timely \nmanner shows a defect in character.  There is no evidence in the records that provides \nany unusual factors or circumstances beyond his control that rendered him unable to file \nhis taxes on time for the years in question.  Nor did Applicant file an extension to \naccommodate circumstances which might prevent him from filing his returns on time.  \nApplicant simply ignored the situation until it became a problem.  In fact, he admitted \nthat he should have hired a CPA sooner instead of telling himself that he could do it \nwithout help, which led to his frustration and ultimately procrastination, which has \ncaused him nothing but needless problems.  (Government Ex. 2, at page 4.)  Applicant \nhas not acted responsibly under the circumstances.  There is no justification for his \nmisconduct, or anything else in the record, to mitigate this violation of the tax laws.  It is \nnoted that Applicant is an attorney who made the choice to ignore his income tax filings \nuntil he felt his pride would allow him to seek professional assistance.  This \ndemonstrates a lack of judgment and reliability needed to be eligible for access to \nclassified information.   \n       \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFor four years, namely 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017, Applicant did not file his \nFederal and state income tax returns as required by law.  Applicant\u2019s 2012 and 2013 \nincome tax returns were filed after the SOR was issued.  His 2016 and 2017 income tax \nreturns were filed just several months before the SOR was issued.  It is recognized that \nwithin the last two years, Applicant has taken some positive steps to correct his \nmistakes.   He has now filed the Federal and state income tax returns in question.  \nHowever, by failing to file his income tax returns in a timely fashion in the first place, \nApplicant imposed an undue burden on the taxing authorities, has committed a serious \noffense, and has been irresponsible under the law.  Applicant has not demonstrated a \ntrack record of diligence and responsibility.  In fact, his past record shows poor \njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.  He has failed to show that he has earned \nthe privilege to access to classified information.  None of the conditions under this \nguideline establish full mitigation.   \n  \nApplicant submits that if a security clearance is not warranted in this case, a \nconditional grant of Applicant\u2019s clearance should be granted with the requirement that \nApplicant submit Federal and state transcripts for a reasonable number of future years \nand be required to prove compliance with the filing and paying of taxes.  After due \nconsideration, I find that a conditional clearance is not appropriate in this case.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \n \n           Against Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 2, 2019. On \nOctober 27, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines K, M, E, and F. The DCSA CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant received the SOR on November 2, 2020, answered it on a date not \nreflected in the record, and requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn February 16, 2021, the Government sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, \na file of relevant material (FORM), including pleadings and evidentiary documents \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nidentified as Items 1 through 13.

He received the FORM on March 6, 2021, and did not respond \nor object to the Government\u2019s evidence. The case was assigned to me on June 4, 2021. \nItems 1 through 3 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 4 through 13 are admitted into \nevidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included evidentiary documents that I admitted into \nevidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through P. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 33, earned a high school diploma in 2005. He has taken courses at \na university (University A) since 2012, but has not yet earned a degree. He served \nhonorably in the U.S. Air Force from 2006 through 2012. He was employed as an \ninformation assurance specialist by a defense contractor (Company A) from April 2018 \nuntil July 2019; and as a cyber-information assurance analyst by another defense \ncontractor (Company B) since July 2019. He held an active DOD security clearance while \nemployed by Company A, but the record did not otherwise indicate his security clearance \nhistory while in the service or thereafter. Company B is sponsoring his pending security \nclearance application. (Item 2, 4, 6; Item 5 at 4) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline K (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.b), and cross alleged under \nGuideline M (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.b) and Guideline E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.b), that, on two \noccasions in 2019, Applicant downloaded files from his unclassified work computer in \nviolation of Company A policy. Also under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant \nfalsified material facts regarding his file download activity during two different interviews \nin 2019, one with a Company A investigator (SOR \u00b6 3.c) and one with a DOD investigator \n(SOR \u00b6 3.d). Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 11 delinquent debts \ntotaling $48,087 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a \u2013 4.k). \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant responded \u201cI admit\u201d to the facts alleged under \nGuideline K (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u20131.b), which were cross alleged under Guideline M (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \n\u2013 2.b) and Guideline E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.d). On the other hand, in the explanations \naccompanying those responses, Applicant denied the misconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n(and cross alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 3.b). Thus, I have construed his admissions to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.b, and 3.b as denials. He also responded \u201cI admit\u201d to the facts alleged under \nGuideline F (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a \u2013 4.k). Regarding Guideline E, he denied the facts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d. (Items 1, 2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, and 3.b \nOn June 20, 2019, Applicant downloaded over 2,000 files from his unclassified \nwork computer and transferred them to his personal universal serial bus (USB) drive. On \nJune 22, 2019, he informed Company A of his resignation and intent to begin employment \nwith Company B on July 22, 2019. On July 8, 2019, Company A discovered Applicant\u2019s \nhigh-volume file transfer and initiated an immediate investigation. (Items 6, 7) \nCompany A determined that the files contained on Applicant\u2019s personal USB drive \nincluded Company A proprietary information, third-party proprietary information (related \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto two U.S. government programs on which Applicant was contracted to work), and \nexport-controlled information (as designated by the International Traffic in Arms \nRegulations (ITAR) and the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM)). Those files \nwere marked Company A Proprietary. Company A concluded that Applicant\u2019s \ndownloading and transfer of files to his personal USB drive was a deliberate attempt to \nobtain proprietary data for outside use, which was unauthorized and a direct violation of \nthe following Company A policies: 1) Code of Conduct and 2) Protection of Company A \nand Third-Party Information. (Items 6, 7, 10, 11) \nThe investigation revealed no evidence that Applicant ever transferred those files \nfrom his USB drive to any other computer, that the USB drive ever left his personal \nresidence where it had been stored, that any classified data resided on the USB drive, or \nthat Applicant had any previous security incidents on his record. Nevertheless, the \ninvestigation concluded that Applicant\u2019s behavior and actions, including false statements \nhe made during the investigation, were \u201cInsider Threat Activity\u201d and a risk to all Company \nA information systems. As a result, on July 8, 2019, Company A expedited his \nemployment separation, seized all of Applicant\u2019s computing devices, removed his badge \naccess, escorted him off Company A\u2019s property, and submitted an adverse statement in \nthe DOD personnel security clearance and access database. (Items 6, 7) \nOn July 8, 2019, after Applicant was escorted off its property, Company A \ndiscovered information on Applicant\u2019s seized laptop which revealed that he also \ndownloaded and transferred files from his unclassified work computer to eight computer \ndiscs on July 2, 2019. Company A determined that the files on the discs contained \nCompany A cyber security-related tools and training, but did not provide the results of its \nforensic investigation of the discs which was \u201cin progress\u201d as of July 12, 2019, the date \nof its final report of the misconduct for which Applicant\u2019s separation was expedited. \nNeither the report nor any other record evidence indicated what, if any, conclusions that \ninvestigation formed about the presence of classified information on the discs or whether \nApplicant\u2019s actions in downloading or transferring the files to the discs violated any \nCompany A policies or other rules. While acknowledging that \u201cthere is currently no \nevidence that Applicant copied the discs for his own use and/or removed the discs from \n[Company A\u2019]s premises,\u201d the Government argued in its FORM that Applicant\u2019s disc-\nrelated file transfer activity remained relevant \u201cfor the concerns it potentially raises under \nGuidelines K, M, and E.\u201d (Item 7) \nApplicant denied that his disc-related file transfer activity was either unauthorized \nor violated any policies or rules. Given the timing of the discovery, Applicant was not \nquestioned about his disc-related file transfer activity during Company A\u2019s investigation. \nHowever, he addressed it during his December 2019 security clearance interview (SI) \nand in his SOR answer. During his SI, Applicant explained that he never copied any files \nonto discs for his personal use and that his team regularly copied files onto discs in the \nordinary course of business. In his SOR answer, he provided more details about the file \ntransfer and reiterated that it was not done for his personal use. He clarified that he \ntransferred the files (which were too voluminous to email) onto the discs to facilitate a \nsuccessful transition of the systems he managed to the team member who was taking \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nover his position.

(Item 3 at 1; Item 5 at 4) \nApplicant acknowledged being aware of the proper security procedures for \nhandling classified information when he was employed by Company A. However, he \nclaimed that he had not had any training on handling proprietary information. He asserted \nthat he always tried to follow security rules and that anytime he witnessed someone \nviolating security regulations, he would counsel them and train them. As of December \n2019, he had not had any security-related incidents while employed by Company B. (5 at \n5; Item 7 at 4) \nIn September 2017, Applicant signed an employment agreement in connection \nwith his Company A employment entitled \u201cEmployee Agreement \u2013 Proprietary \nInformation, Inventions and Other Intellectual Property.\u201d Among the matters to which \nApplicant agreed were that his work product while employed by Company A was the sole \nand exclusive property of Company A unless expressly released in writing. He also \nagreed that he was prohibited from using, for his own or another\u2019s benefit, not only his \nown work product, but also any Company A or third-party proprietary information with \nwhich he had been entrusted or had otherwise acquired by virtue of his employment with \nCompany A. (Item 9) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.d \nIn his August 2019 SCA, Applicant reported that he had been \u201cwarned, \nreprimanded, suspended, or disciplined\u201d in July 2019 by Company A because he \u201cused \na USB to transfer data/files from [his] unclassified work computer.\u201d He explained: \u201cMy \nintentions were to bring any personal forms containing my [personally identifiable \ninformation (PII)], databases or tools I created (via excel, viso [sic], word, powerpoint) to \nbuild a portfolio [sic] I can reference prior work that assisted/streamlined tasks for my \nposition.\u201d He asserted that the files that he transferred were \u201cfrom an OPEN area\u201d and \n\u201cfrom [his] personal UNCLASSIFIED computer.\u201d While he acknowledged that he was told \nby a Company A investigator that the files he transferred were \u201c[Company A] Proprietary,\u201d \nhe claimed that the files he transferred \u201cwere not marked with any type of Proprietary \nMarkings (header/footer etc).\u201d (Item 4 at 16) \nApplicant answered \u201cYes\u201d on his SCA when asked whether he had \u201cintroduced, \nremoved, or used hardware, software, or media in connection with any information \ntechnology system without authorization, when specifically prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, or regulations\u201d within the prior seven years. He reported July 2019 as the \ndate of the incident. For reasons not explained in the record, Applicant did not report on \nhis SCA that he was previously granted a security clearance. (Item 4 at 35-36, 39-40) \nApplicant was interviewed twice about the facts and circumstances surrounding \nhis Company A file transfer activity. The first interview was conducted by a Company A \ninvestigator during its July 2019 investigation (Interview 1). The second interview was \nconducted by a DOD investigator in December 2019 in connection with Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance background investigation (Interview 2).

When initially \nquestioned during Interview 1, Applicant stated that he had not used any USB drive. After \nthe question was rephrased, he stated that he was uncertain as to previous usage of a \nUSB drive. After being reminded that Company A conducts user monitoring, Applicant \nreported that he discovered a USB drive on his desk. When asked to describe the data \nsaved on the USB drive, Applicant claimed that only PII information containing social \nsecurity number (SSN) data was stored on the USB drive. After he was informed that \nCompany A\u2019s system indicated over 2,000 documents were downloaded onto the USB \ndrive, Applicant admitted that he copied personal files and databases that he created with \nthe intention to use them for reference purposes in the future. He later clarified that the \nfiles on the USB drive were intended to be used as references for future work outside of \nCompany A. He acknowledged that he had taken the USB drive to his home, but \nmaintained that he never connected it to his personal computer. (Item 7) \nDuring Interview 1, Applicant signed a voluntary statement admitting that he \n\u201ccopied data from [his] unclassified [Company A] computer, with the intension [sic] of \nusing files for reference purposes at a later date.\u201d He explained: \nThe files were going to be a means of \u201creferenced worked\u201d from a coworker \nwhom [sic] trained me when I initially started. The files came from my [two \nU.S. government programs on which Applicant worked] systems, large \nnetworks with many hours devoted to each program. The [USB drive] that \nwas used to transfer the data has left [Company A] property/grounds, and I \nstored it at home. While it was there, the [USB drive] was not used. I was \nunaware of the [Company A] Proprietary Policy. My understanding was that \nit was unclassified, did not contain classified information so being able to \nreference prior work was not an issue. . . .\u201d (Items 7, 8) \nWhen initially questioned about his Company A file transfer activity during \nInterview 2, Applicant addressed both his USB drive and disc-related file transfer activity. \nHe denied transferring any files onto discs for his personal use, but admitted that he \ntransferred files to his USB drive for his personal use. He asserted that he transferred \nonly his personal files from a folder labeled with his last name from his unclassified work \ncomputer to his USB drive around spring of 2019. He also acknowledged that he later \nrealized that a folder labeled with the name of one of the U.S. government programs on \nwhich he worked was also copied. He did not indicate the specific timeframe that \nrealization occurred. He claimed that he intended to use the personal files he copied to \nhis USB drive as a portfolio to assist him with a job search, and that he had not been \noffered another job at the time that he transferred the files.

(Item 5 at 5) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied falsifying any information that he provided \nduring Interviews 1 and 2. He stated: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, I did not lie or attempt \nto withhold that I had used a USB thumb drive\u201d from the investigator during Interview 1. \nHe also claimed that the use of USB devices to transfer files was practiced almost daily \non his Company A team and that he was \u201ca bit confused\u201d when the investigator explained \nthat his file transfer activity was against Company A policy. He reaffirmed the spring of \n2019 timeline he gave to the investigator during Interview 2. Additionally, he clarified that \nhe gave the investigator \u201ca broad timeline\u201d of spring of 2019 because he did not recall the \nexact date. He affirmed that he is now certain that his initial file transfer activity occurred \nin \u201cearly spring of 2019.\u201d He also reaffirmed: \u201cAgain the files downloaded prior to me \ngiving notice were personal . . . The files that were downloaded days prior to me giving \nmy notice, was again to copy any [Company B] offer related documentation.\u201d (Item 3) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant maintained that, in \u201cearly spring of 2019,\u201d he \nintended only to transfer a folder containing his personal files to the USB drive, including \n\u201cblank tools (weekly checklist, to-do list), school/certification study material, and \ndocuments pertaining solely to [him].\u201d He acknowledged that in \u201cmid to late June 2019,\u201d \nhe discovered that the personal folder he transferred to his USB drive also contained an \nadditional folder named after one of the U.S. government programs on which he worked. \nHe claimed that he did not intentionally transfer that additional folder as he knew that it \ncontained information that did not pertain to him. The record did not indicate when or if \nhe notified Company A of that discovery prior to confrontation. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a through 4.k \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports confirm the 11 debts alleged in the \nSOR totaling $48,087, including four utility accounts totaling $533; six federal student-\nloan accounts totaling $31,894: and a $15,660 charged-off automobile loan. (Items 3, 12, \n13) \n \nApplicant paid the automobile-loan account in September 2018 (SOR \u00b6 4.k) and \nthree of the four utility accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a through 4.d. He paid the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 4.d ($26) in November 2020. The record does not indicate when he paid \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b ($108) and 4.c ($332).

He denied receiving any \ndelinquency or collection notices prior to that phone call, and believed any such notices \nmust have been sent to either a wrong or prior address. He asserted, without providing \ncorroborating documents, that he initiated a plan in October 2019 to pay $5 per month \ntowards his USDOE debt and was current with those payments as of December 2019. \n(Item 4 at 37-38; Item 5 at 3-6) \nIn February 2020, Applicant entered into an agreement to rehabilitate his federal \nstudent-loan accounts with a collection agent for the USDOE, including the six accounts \nalleged in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.e through 4.j) and one account that was not alleged. At \nthat time, the total amount due for all seven accounts was $45,170. He agreed to make \nat least nine monthly payments of $352 beginning February 2020, and expected to have \nhis accounts fully rehabilitated by November 2020. In his May 2020 response to \ninterrogatories, he claimed that he was current with those payments and had reduced the \nbalance to approximately $37,000. Applicant did not provide any corroborating \ndocuments to show that any payments were made or that the accounts have been fully \nrehabilitated. The information reported about these accounts on his January 2021 credit \nreport did not establish that they have been rehabilitated or otherwise resolved. (AE J; \nItem 3; Item 5 at 8) \nApplicant attributed his indebtedness to the fact that his GI Bill had \u201crun out\u201d as he \nwas finishing his degree with University A and did not cover the entirety of his expenses \nas he anticipated. Without indicating to what year(s) he was referring, he asserted that he \nwas \u201cunable to pay any amount\u201d towards his debts due to underemployment with an \nannual salary of $45,000, which he used to pay for his living expenses. He claimed that \nhe has \u201cmade a point to get [himself] out of debt and work on [his] credit\u201d since becoming \nemployed by Company B, with an annual salary that increased by \u201cmore than double.\u201d \nHe reported that he successfully increased his credit score from \u201cvery poor to good.\u201d The \nrecord did not otherwise specify his relevant income history and expenses, or other details \nabout his overall financial stability. It also did not indicate whether he had any financial \ncounseling or the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted his \nfinances. (Item 3; Item 5 at 8) \nWhole Person Concept  \nApplicant\u2019s work performance and character are highly regarded by nine \nindividuals who wrote reference letters on his behalf. None of those individuals signified \nthat they were aware of the facts alleged in the SOR or Applicant\u2019s USB-related file \ntransfer activity. (AE A \u2013 I). Applicant asserted that three of the individuals who were \nCompany A coworkers (AE A, C, F) were aware of that activity. (Item 5 at 5) However, \nthe extent of that awareness was not indicated in the record. Two of those three Company \nA coworkers now work with Applicant at Company B (AE A, C). \nDuring his Air Force service, Applicant served as an Assistant Non-Commissioned \nOfficer in Charge (NCO) of Security Forces Training and alternate security manager (SM). \nHis duties as SM included creating security policies and regulations.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The Government \nacknowledged in its FORM that \u201cthere is currently no evidence that Applicant copied the \ndiscs for his own use and/or removed the discs from [Company A\u2019]s premises.\u201d Moreover, \nthe record established only that Company A initiated a forensic investigation after \ndiscovering that Applicant downloaded and transferred files to the eight discs. The results \nof that investigation (including whether Applicant\u2019s actions were unauthorized or \notherwise violated either Company A\u2019s policies or any other rules) were not indicated in \nthe record. Thus, I find SOR \u00b6 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 35 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has \nhappened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 35(c): the security violations were due to improper or inadequate \ntraining or unclear instructions; and \nAG \u00b6 35(d): the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is \nno evidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nApplicant downloaded over 2,000 files from his unclassified work computer and \ntransferred them to his personal USB drive two days before submitting his resignation. \nThat activity was not authorized by Company A. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements and \nattempts to frame his actions as innocuous are directly at odds with persuasive record \nevidence. \nApplicant signed an agreement outlining his responsibilities for handling \nproprietary information. Moreover, his background and experience together with his \nefforts to downplay his conduct indicate that he knew that actions were prohibited, \nregardless of whether he received specialized training on handling proprietary \ninformation. The sheer number of downloaded files supports a conclusion that Applicant \nwas transferring more than merely his personal non-proprietary files and Company B \noffer-related documents. \nApplicant\u2019s mishandling of protected information while employed at Company A \nraises a security concern about his willingness and ability to properly handle protected \ninformation going forward. Applicant\u2019s actions were deliberate, recent, and serious. His \nrepeated lack of candor further undermines confidence that his misconduct is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), (c), and (d) are not established. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation.

Thus, I find SOR \u00b6 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 41 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 41(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 41(a) was not established for the reasons articulated under Guideline K. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nApplicant\u2019s unauthorized transfer of proprietary and sensitive files from his \nunclassified work computer to his personal USB drive also establishes the general \nconcerns involving questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations and the following specific disqualifying condition under Guideline E regarding \nthe facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a:  \nAG \u00b6 16(f): violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment. \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline K, the Government did not meet its \nburden to establish any disqualifying condition under this guideline regarding the facts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b. Thus, I find SOR \u00b6 3.b in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate lack of candor about his unauthorized file transfer activity \nduring Interviews 1 and 2 further substantiates the general concerns under Guideline E, \nand also establishes the following additional specific disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nand \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \ngovernment protected information; (2) any disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) \nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or \nresources. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time of the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \nAn applicant\u2019s education and experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to \ndisclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) \nI did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations and excuses for his false and \ninconsistent statements during Interviews 1 and 2. Not only did Applicant exhibit poor \njudgment when he initially lied about using a USB drive during Interview 1, but he also \ndid not own up to it until after much prodding by the investigator. He then proceeded to \nobscure the scope and intent of his file transfer activity throughout the remainder of \nInterview 1. Applicant similarly downplayed and quibbled about the facts and \ncircumstances of his unauthorized file transfer activity during Interview 2, which not only \nfurther damaged his credibility but also suggested that he was aware of the potentially \nnegative impact his actions could have on his security clearance. The record evidence as \na whole, particularly in light of his background and experience, precludes a finding that \nhe was uninformed about the proper handling of proprietary information. I find substantial \nevidence of an intent on the part of Applicant not only to provide false and misleading \nstatements, but also to omit and conceal materially relevant information during Interviews \n1 and 2. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline K and in reference to AG \u00b6 16(a), I \nconclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nunauthorized file transfer activity and lack of candor during Interviews 1 and 2. He further \ndamaged his credibility when he persisted in misrepresenting facts on his SCA and in his \nSOR answer. His lack of candor during the security clearance process is particularly \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \negregious. A failure to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government in \nconnection with a security clearance investigation interferes with the integrity of the \nindustrial security program. \nApplicant\u2019s actions call into question his ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations, and reveal a willingness to place his own self-interest above his \nsecurity obligations. Even assuming that he has not violated any security policies or other \nrules while employed by Company B, his refusal to acknowledge or accept responsibility \nfor any intentional wrongdoing continues to undermine confidence in his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Because he failed to demonstrate a sufficient pattern of \nreformed behavior, I am unable to conclude that this type of misconduct is behind him. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), (c), and (d) are not established. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are established to mitigate concerns raised by the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a through 4.d and 4.k, the latter of which Applicant resolved well \nbefore it became an issue with respect to his security clearance. While Applicant did not \nproffer sufficient evidence to corroborate his resolution of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.a, \nI do not find it security significant in light of the record as a whole. Thus, I find those \nallegations in his favor. However, Applicant failed to meet his burden to establish AG \u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) to mitigate the history of indebtedness associated with his federal \nstudent-loan debt. \nApplicant\u2019s student-loan debt is significant and remains unresolved. Regardless of \nwhether it was largely attributable to issues of underemployment or GI Bill coverage, \nApplicant did not meet his burden to establish that he acted responsibly to address his \nstudent-loan debt in the years since July 2017, when his accounts initially became \ndelinquent. The extent to which other factors not indicated in the record may have \nimpacted the repayment of Applicant\u2019s federal student-loan accounts would not preclude \nconsideration of the overall history associated with this debt. \nApplicant is credited with initiating efforts to rehabilitate his delinquent loan \naccounts in February 2020. However, he failed to establish that his prior inaction was \nreasonable. He also failed to corroborate his alleged 2019 and 2020 payments, the \ncurrent status of the loan accounts, and whether they were successfully rehabilitated. The \nrecord contains scant details concerning his ability to meet his financial obligations, \nincluding the specific period when he was underemployed. Applicant did not demonstrate \na meaningful track record of regular and timely payments or otherwise prove that he is \nable to follow through with his plan for repaying his student-loan debt. Applicant failed to \nestablish that his indebtedness is not likely to recur and no longer casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I have considered that Applicant is not \nrequired to be debt-free in order to qualify for a security clearance. However, in light of \nthe record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines K, M, E, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines K, M, E, and F, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his misconduct involving failure to comply with \nrules and regulations for handling protected information and misuse of information \ntechnology; his lack of candor about that misconduct; and his indebtedness. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.c \u2013 3.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a \u2013 4.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.e \u2013 4.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant provides approximately $300 per month to two resident citizens of the Philippines (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) and $200 a month to another resident citizen of the country (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant admitted that he continues to provide financial support for the Phillippe women in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, whom he met online ten 2 years ago. He described them as \u201cextremely poor\u201d and indicated that his \u201ctargeted humanitarian aid\u201d for them is \u201cjust enough for food assistance and minimal shelter so they do not live on the streets.\u201d He stated that if he suspected they were being exploited in an effort to leverage him, he would contact security immediately. He admitted that he had previously provided financial support for a third Philippine woman (SOR \u00b6 1.c), whom he met online seven years ago. He has not provided her any financial assistance in over a year, and they no longer communicate. Applicant\u2019s admissions to having befriended and provided financial support to the three Philippine women are accepted and incorporated in my factual findings. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old senior electrical engineer. He has never married and has no children. A college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering earned in May 1997, he took a hiatus from his career and was unemployed from July 2004 to May 2008 while focusing on attaining a ",

On March 8, 2021, and again on April 20, 2021, I \ninformed Applicant that DOHA was conducting online video hearings because of ongoing \ntravel restrictions due to the pandemic. Following a successful test of the Defense \nCollaboration Services (DCS) system, on April 29, 2021, I scheduled a DCS video \nteleconference hearing for May 20, 2021. \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) were admitted without \nobjection. A Government request for administrative notice with extracts of the source \ndocuments concerning the Philippines was accepted as a hearing exhibit (HE 1) without \nobjection. Applicant submitted nine exhibits (AEs A-I), which were accepted into the \nrecord without any objections, and he testified as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on May 27, 2021. \nAdministrative Notice Request \n \nThe Government\u2019s October 26, 2020 request for administrative notice was based \non seven publications of the U.S. State Department reporting human rights, terrorism and \nsecurity, travel, and money laundering issues in the Philippines; three publications of the \nU.S. Justice Department reporting espionage and related criminal activities targeting the \nUnited States by the Philippines or Philippine interests; and one publication by the U.S. \nDefense Department reporting espionage by Americans. Applicant confirmed that he \nreceived the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice with the source documents. \nPursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political \nconditions in evaluating Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007)), I informed the parties that I would take administrative notice of the facts \nrequested by the Government, subject to the relevance and materiality of the source \ndocumentation, and whether the facts are substantiated by reliable government sources. \nI also informed the parties that, after reviewing the source documents, I may take \nadministrative notice of additional facts based on updated positions of the U.S. \ngovernment. Applicant was offered an opportunity to propose facts for administrative \nnotice, which he declined. The facts administratively noticed are set forth below. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant provides approximately $300 per month to two \nresident citizens of the Philippines (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) and $200 a month to another resident \ncitizen of the country (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant admitted that he continues to provide \nfinancial support for the Phillippe women in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, whom he met online ten \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nyears ago. He described them as \u201cextremely poor\u201d and indicated that his \u201ctargeted \nhumanitarian aid\u201d for them is \u201cjust enough for food assistance and minimal shelter so they \ndo not live on the streets.\u201d He stated that if he suspected they were being exploited in an \neffort to leverage him, he would contact security immediately. He admitted that he had \npreviously provided financial support for a third Philippine woman (SOR \u00b6 1.c), whom he \nmet online seven years ago. He has not provided her any financial assistance in over a \nyear, and they no longer communicate. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to having befriended and provided financial support to the \nthree Philippine women are accepted and incorporated in my factual findings. After \nconsidering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior electrical engineer. He has never married and \nhas no children. A college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer \nengineering earned in May 1997, he took a hiatus from his career and was unemployed \nfrom July 2004 to May 2008 while focusing on attaining a more healthy weight. Applicant \nhas worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since September 2016. (GE \n1.) \nOn November 10, 2016, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) for security clearance eligibility. In response to an SF 86 inquiry \nconcerning any close or continuing contacts with a foreign national in the last seven years, \nApplicant listed three women in the Philippines. He also answered affirmatively to an SF \n86 inquiry concerning whether he had ever provided financial support for any foreign \nnational. His SF 86 disclosures about these women, including about his contacts with \nthem, and his financial support for them, follow. \nForeign contact #1 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nApplicant met this woman online in a chatroom October 2009 when he was looking \nfor a new relationship. (GE 1; Tr. 32.) Their contacts quickly turned from the chatroom to \ntexts on the phone. (Tr. 33, 40.) She is a single mother and a resident citizen of her native \nPhilippines. As of November 2016, she was selling mostly perfume at a boutique for her \nemployment. Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he had a romantic interest in her at \none time (See also Tr. 46), but their relationship had evolved into \u201conline friends of [a] \nsemi-romantic nature\u201d as of November 2016. (GE 1.) He now asserts that he \u201cwas just \nlooking for people to talk with.\u201d (Tr. 33.) He had sent her photos of himself at one time. \n(Tr. 46.) Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he was helping her out \u201cperiodically due to \nher poor economic condition\u201d and that he had contact with her by text messaging two or \nthree times a month \u201cto catch up on what\u2019s happening in [their] personal lives.\u201d Applicant \nestimated on his SF 86 that he had provided her with some financial support on a monthly \nbasis and had given her about $10,000 total over the years he has known her. (GE 1.) \nHis support for her started early on with $50 to purchase some food after she lost her \nemployment. By 2012 or 2013, he was sending her $300 a month, usually in response to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na request for rent money. (Tr. 35, 54.) Previously, she would contact him randomly and \nask for money for food. (Tr. 53-55.) \nForeign contact #2 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nApplicant met this resident citizen of the Philippines online in the same chatroom \nin October 2009 when he was looking for a romantic interest. As with female friend #1, \nhis contacts with female friend #2 went quickly to text messaging. (Tr. 44.) He reported \non his SF 86 that his romantic interest in her quickly waned, but he also described their \nrelationship as \u201conline friends of [a] semi-romantic nature.\u201d As with female friend #1, he \nprovided her some photos of himself. (Tr. 46.) They stayed in touch over the years, \nprimarily by electronic means, about a couple times a month. A single mother, she was \ncleaning houses in her town as of November 2016. Applicant \u201chelped her through some \nrough times financially with food/medical bills when needed.\u201d (GE 1.) His support started \nwith small amounts but after a few years, it became $300 a month. (Tr. 46.) Applicant \nestimated on his SF 86 that he had provided her with some financial support on a monthly \nbasis and had given her about $6,000 total over the years he has known her. (GE 1.) \nForeign contact #3 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nAs of November 2016, Applicant had what he describes as \u201ca romantic interest\u201d in \na resident citizen of the Philippines whom he met online through a chatroom in November \n2012. (GE 1; Tr. 48-49.) They were in contact almost daily by texting, primarily about food \nand entertainment. Now age 28, she was unemployed and living with a family friend. By \nNovember 2016, he had given her monthly support totaling $8,000 because she was \nstruggling financially due to her lack of education and her mother\u2019s death. (GE 1.) \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on June 29, 2018, partially about his listed foreign contacts. \nApplicant reported that he was still in contact by electronic means with the three women \nin the Philippines; with female friends #1 and #2 weekly and with female friend #3 monthly. \nHe indicated about the foreign female friends that #1 was currently a full-time student; \nthat #2 was cleaning residences under \u201cmore of a handshake agreement;\u201d and that #3 \nwas unemployed. He reported sending friends #1 and #2 each $300 a month for \nestimated total support of $15,700 to friend #1 and $11,700 to friend #2, and $200 a \nmonth to friend #3 for a total of $11,800 over the years. Applicant related that he had \nnever met these women in person. (GE 2.) \nOn July 3, 2018, Applicant was contacted telephonically by the OPM investigator \nabout possible foreign influence concerns. Applicant provided the birthdates, birthplaces, \nand current addresses in the Philippines for the three women. (GE 2; Tr. 34.) The \naddresses for female friends #2 and #3 were in cities in Mindanao, but not those reported \nby the U.S. State Department as being at highest risk for terrorist activity. He denied he \ncould be blackmailed because his relationships with them are discrete, and because the \nassistance he provides them is for food, shelter, and basic necessities to make their lives \neasier. He views his support as aiding the less fortunate and explained that he is \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncontinuing a tradition of helping others that was started by his grandmother. Applicant \nrelated that none of the foreign women know his income or anything about his \nemployment other than that he works with computers. He admitted that no one is aware \nof his contacts with these Philippine women because he texts the women on his private \nphone. (GE 2.) \nApplicant did not cease his communication with or support for the Philippine \nwomen after he started working for the defense contractor because he did not think it \nappropriate to do so. He testified that he has not witnessed any inconsistencies in his \ncontacts with them over the years. (Tr. 30.) He has continued to provide both of the \nPhilippine female friends #1 and #2 $300 each month in financial support. (Tr. 57-58.) He \ntransfers the funds through a website that uses banks as payout locations in the \nPhilippines. (Tr. 35-36, 46, 48.) He has tried to ensure that the money he sent over the \nyears was used for housing, food, and other items, such as a rice cooker, and he asked \nfor and was sent some photographs and receipts of some of the items purchased. (AE I; \nTr. 29-30, 37-38.) He helped female friend #1 with her education by providing some \nmoney for class materials and some placement test fees. (Tr. 42-43.) Apparently, she \ncompleted her degree and was then able to find employment, but only for a month or two \nbefore the pandemic hit and she lost her job. (Tr. 62-63.) Some of the financial support \nfor female friend #2 went to medical care for her and dental care for her daughter. (AE I.) \nThere have been occasions when the Philippine women have asked him for money to \npurchase something but there was a limit on how much he was willing to give. (Tr. 55.) \nApplicant communicates with Philippine female friend #1 weekly, usually about her \nsituation and the weather. (Tr. 33, 46.) She is not employed currently. She had a job doing \nsecretarial work for a small company and took some college courses before she lost her \njob in the pandemic and moved with her son near her parents in a small house in the \nmountains. (AE I; Tr. 36-37.) She does not pay rent but is billed for electricity and water, \nwhich together costs her $50 to $100 a month. Applicant understands that her small home \nis \u201cgifted by the town.\u201d (Tr. 38.) Several years ago, female friend #1 asked him for money \nto purchase \u201ca motorcycle or something or a bike to get around,\u201d and he refused her. (Tr. \n55-56.) \nApplicant communicates with Philippine female friend #2 weekly. (Tr. 45.) She has \na daughter who lives with her. (AE I; Tr. 46.) Due to the pandemic, female friend #2 is not \ncurrently employed. She has not completed high school and has found her job prospects \nlimited to cleaning or laundry duties. Her rent costs her \u201croughly $100\u201d per month. (Tr. 47\u00ad\n48.) \nApplicant has not had any communication with, or provided any money to, the \nPhilippine woman #3 since sometime in 2019. (AE B; Tr. 51-52.) She is romantically \ninvolved with someone else. (AE B.) Applicant took that as her needs were being met, \nand she no longer needed his assistance. (Tr. 52.) \nApplicant has not tried to provide any financial support for the women through a \ncharitable organization for the following reasons: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI wasn\u2019t aware of any that I trusted. Charities, I don\u2019t, it\u2019s hit or miss on how \neffective specific charities are, [and] they tend to capture all of the proceeds \nfor their own management. And so, there\u2019s very few charities that I would \ntrust. . . Especially in that area of the world, you know, [it\u2019s] more likely that \nthey would embezzle or, you know, to capture [those] proceeds themselves. \n(Tr. 41.) \n \nApplicant cannot recall any specific instance where he has told anyone about his \nfinancial support for the Philippine women, although he had perhaps mentioned it to a co-\nworker who runs a charity in the United States. He asked his friend how he deals with \ndonations, but it wasn\u2019t applicable to the Philippines. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant testified that \nthe $600 in monthly financial support is \u201cnot that great of a burden\u201d for him. (Tr. 63.) He \nhas mentioned to both of them that he would like them to become more self-sufficient. \n(Tr. 64.) He has not proposed a cut-off date for his financial support. If able, he intends to \ncontinue to provide the financial support for female friends #1 and #2 for the foreseeable \nfuture. (Tr. 65.) \nApplicant testified that he would report any suspicious activity immediately. (Tr. \n67.) Because of the difficulties living in the Philippines, he has advised his female friends \nthere to stay off the streets and only go to the market when it is necessary. To the extent \nthat there is a security risk because of his foreign contacts in the Philippines, he considers \nthem mitigated in part because of the security protocols at his workplace. He understands \nthat travel to the Philippines is ill-advised and has no plans to travel there. (AE H.) \nWork Performance \nApplicant held an interim security clearance from March 2017 until it was \nwithdrawn because of the April 2020 SOR. (Tr. 31.) During that time, he worked on a few \nclassified programs but his work did not routinely require classified access. (Tr. 28.) He \nhad to decline an April 2021 request for subject matter expert support at a facility located \nin another part of the United States because he does not currently hold a clearance. (AE \nG; Tr. 28-29.) He estimates that only about 10 to 20 percent of his work would require \nclassified access. (Tr. 32.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2017 through 2019 show that he has been \na highly effective contributor since he started his employment. He is a subject matter \nexpert in boundary scan tests. Dedicated and detailed in his work, he has become a \nvaluable member of the organization. He has been eager to learn and willing to help his \nteammates. (AEs D-F.) \nAdministrative Notice \nAdministrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of \nspecific facts properly noticed and relevant and material to the issues.

For additional background investigation regarding the Philippines \nrelationship with the United States, I reviewed the U.S. State Department\u2019s website, \nincluding its Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, issued for the Philippines on January 21, \n2020. Of note, some of the source documentation relied on by the Government has been \nupdated. On March 30, 2021, the State Department issued its 2020 Country Reports on \nHuman Rights Practices: Philippines, and on April 20, 2021, the State Department issued \na Philippines Travel Advisory. On April 7, 2021, the State Department commented in a \npress briefing about recent moves by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in the South \nChina Sea and their impact on the Philippine-U.S. relationship. Salient facts about the \nPhilippines include the following. \nThe Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. \nMidterm elections in May 2019 were generally seen as free and fair. U.S.-Philippine \nrelations are based on strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to \ndemocracy and human rights. The U.S. has designated the Philippines as a major Non-\nNATO ally, and there are close and abiding security ties between the two nations. The \nManila Declaration signed in 2011 reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense \nTreaty as the foundation for a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. The \nU.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue advances discussion and cooperation on \nbilateral, regional, and global issues. The United States has provided considerable \nassistance to the Philippines toward the goals of strengthening democratic governance \nand supporting Philippine government efforts to promote inclusive development and \ncontribute to security and development cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. There are an \nestimated four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the U.S., and more than \n220,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines, including a large presence of U.S. veterans. \nThe United States continues to provide disaster relief and recovery to the \nPhilippines. The two countries have a strong trade and investment relationship, and are \nmembers of many of the same international organizations, including the United Nations. \nIn response to the PRC recently amassing militia in the South China Sea, the U.S. shares \nthe concerns of its Philippine ally. On April 7, 2021, the United States reiterated its strong \nsupport for the Philippines. The Biden Administration would consider any armed attack \nagainst the Philippines as a trigger for the U.S.\u2019 obligations under the U.S.-Philippines \nMutual Defense Treaty. \nSince the 1980s, several individuals or entities, including some American citizens \nof Philippine birth, have engaged in criminal espionage of classified information or \nsensitive technologies (economic espionage) to the Philippines.

There is no report in the \nrecord of any economic espionage activity involving the Philippines since October 2013. \nFor more than a decade, terrorists, insurgents, and criminal actors carried out \nmajor attacks against civilians, primarily in southern Mindanao and the islands of Basilan \nand Sulu. In 2019, the Philippines was one of the top ten countries with the most terrorist \nincidents and casualties. Since January 2019, there have been multiple bombings in \nMindanao resulting in injuries and deaths, including dual suicide bombings on August 24, \n2020. In March 2020, the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security assessed \nManila as being at medium threat for crime and a high threat for terrorism directed at or \naffecting official U.S. interests. Terrorist groups, such as the New People\u2019s Army (NPA), \nthe Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), and elements within the two \nmain insurgent groups, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic \nLiberation Front (MILF), continued to pose a security threat. On April 24, 2021, the United \nStates raised the threat level for travel to the Philippines from Level 3 to Level 4-do not \ntravel, due to COVID-19. The travel advisory for the Sulu Archipelago and to Marawi City \nin Mindanao remained at Level 4 due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping in \nthe Archipelago and terrorism and civil unrest in Marawi City. Terrorists and armed groups \ncontinue to conduct kidnappings on land and at sea for ransom, bombings, and other \nattacks targeting U.S. citizens, foreigners, civilians, local government institutions, and \nsecurity forces in the Archipelago. Conflicts between remnants of terrorist groups and \nPhilippine security forces in Marawi present a risk of death or injury to civilians. The State \nDepartment also advises that travel be reconsidered to other parts of Mindanao, where \nthe Philippine government maintains a state of emergency and greater police presence \ndue to kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks by terrorist and armed groups. \nThe State Department designated the Philippines as a major money-laundering \njurisdiction in 2019. Insurgents operating in the country derive funding from kidnapping \nfor ransom and narcotics and arms trafficking. The Philippine National Police, which \nmaintains internal security in most of the country, shares responsibility for \ncounterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations with the Armed Forces of the \nPhilippines. The Armed Forces has some domestic security functions in regions of high \nconflict, such as Mindanao. There were numerous reports that government security \nagencies and their informal allies committed arbitrary or unlawful killings in 2020 in \nconnection with the government-directed campaign against illegal drugs. Killings of \nactivists, judicial officials, local government leaders, and journalists by government allies, \nantigovernment insurgents, and unknown assailants continued in 2020. Police impunity \nfor killings was widely suspected. Other significant human rights issues in 2020 included \nreported forced disappearance by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; \nharsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary detention by the government; \nprosecutions of journalists and censorship; and corruption. The police investigated a \nlimited number of complaints of human rights abuses. Slow judicial processes remained \nan obstacle to bringing to justice government officials alleged to have committed human \nrights abuses. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant has had regular contact by text messaging, for the most part weekly, with \ntwo single mothers in the Philippines since October 2009. He met them online seeking a \nromantic relationship. He has provided them financial support, initially on a random basis, \nbut since about 2012 at $300 per month each. He estimated in July 2018 that he had sent \nabout $15,700 to female friend #1 and $11,700 to female friend #2. He admitted at his \nhearing that he has continued to support them at $300 each per month. Based on that \nadmission, he has provided another $10,200 to each of the foreign women since July \n2018. Additionally, he provided financial support totaling $11,800 to female friend #3 \nbetween November 2012 and July 2018. He continued to give her $200 a month until \nsometime in 2019, when he ceased contact with her after she became romantically \ninvolved with someone else. Since October 2009, he has provided financial support in \nexcess of $60,000 to female resident citizens of the Philippines whom he has never met \nin person. \nContacts and connections to foreign citizens can present a heightened risk under \nAG \u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying \nconditions provide: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a friend \nliving under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the friendship ties or other \nforeign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in assessing \nwhether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the foreign \ngovernment; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates. In considering the nature of the foreign government, the administrative judge must \ntake into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case \nNo. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nThe Philippines and the United States have a positive relationship based on strong \nhistorical and cultural links and a commitment to democracy and human rights. In April \n2021, the United States reiterated its strong support for the Philippines and its \ncommitment to its obligations under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. Yet, \nGuideline B concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The Appeal \nBoard has long held that \u201c[t]he United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Some individuals with Philippine ties have been \nimplicated in espionage of classified or economic information, although recent illegal \nactivity has largely involved arms trading. There is no indication that the women are \ninvolved in any illicit or terrorist activities. However, terrorism and kidnapping for ransom \nare persistent problems in the Philippines. The State Department advises that travel be \nreconsidered to Mindanao, where the Philippine government maintains a state of \nemergency and greater police presence due to kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks \nby terrorist and armed groups.  \nApplicant continues to have weekly contact by text messaging with female friends \n#1 and #2, and he provides them each $300 a month in financial support. Although he \ntestified that he wants them to become more self-sufficient, he intends to provide this \nsupport for the foreseeable future. Applicant admitted that he has had a semi-romantic \ninterest in the women. His relationships with these women go beyond a general desire in \nproviding aid to the less fortunate. There is a theoretical risk of pressure or coercion that \ncould be applied against him through these Philippine women that no longer applies with \nrespect to female friend #3, with whom Applicant has had no contact since sometime in \n2019. AGs \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply because of his ongoing ties and contacts with female \nfriends #1 and #2. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f) is triggered when security concerns arise from \u201csubstantial business, \nfinancial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign owned or foreign-\noperated business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest.\u201d Applicant does not have any \nfinancial interest of his own in the Philippines that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(f). His financial \nsupport for the two women in the Philippines is a reflection of the concern he has for the \nforeign women and is not a source of potential risk or conflict independent of his \nrelationship with them. He testified that the $600 a month he currently provides does not \ncause him any financial stress. Under the circumstances, I find AG \u00b6 7(f) does not apply. \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) triggers \nreview of possibly mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8. The following could have some \napplication based on the facts in this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(a), what is known about the positions or activities of female \nPhilippine friends #1 and #2 is that they are currently unemployed. Female friend #1 \nfinished some college classes and briefly held a job doing secretarial work before the \npandemic. Friend #2 did not graduate from high school, and she worked cleaning houses \nbefore the pandemic. Other than friend #1 currently receiving her housing rent-free from \nher municipality, there is no evidence that either woman depends on a government entity \nin the Philippines. Both appear to rely on Applicant for their support. As for the country \ninvolved, the United States and Philippines have a good relationship. However, human \nrights issues and the risk of terrorism in the Philippines preclude full mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 8(a). \nThe first component of AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. Applicant has no sense of \nloyalty, obligation, or allegiance to the Philippines or its government. He has never \ntraveled to the Philippines and has no present intention to do so. However, it cannot \nreasonably be concluded that his sense of obligation to female friends #1 and #2 is so \nminimal to make it unlikely that he will be placed in a position of having to choose between \ntheir interests and those of the United States. Over the last 11\u00bd years, he has given \napproximately $25,900 to friend #1 and $21,900 to friend #2. Applicant has a case for \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nsome mitigation under the second prong of AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthe individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that [he] can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant is a life-long resident \ncitizen of the United States. He was educated in the United States and has worked for \ncompanies in his area. His only ties to the Philippines are these female friends. \nNonetheless, issues of vulnerability to undue foreign influence persist because of the \nlongevity (over a decade) of these foreign ties; the semi-romantic nature of these \nrelationships; and his willingness to continue his financial support for these foreign \ncitizens despite knowing that it raises security issues for the DOD. Applicant has been \nforthcoming about his foreign contacts with the DOD, but he has not taken any steps to \ninform anyone else. He testified that he thought it sufficient to report those contacts on \nhis SF 86, but his failure to inform his family and friends about such longstanding foreign \nties increases his vulnerability to undue foreign influence rather than mitigates it.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Those factors are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nIn foreign influence cases, it must be acknowledged that people act in \nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a foreign family \nmember or friend. As stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family \nmember.\u201d Moreover, in evaluating Guideline B concerns, the Appeal Board has held that: \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \nApplicant chooses to continue to provide \u201ctargeted\u201d financial assistance rather than \nestablish some distance in his relationships with these foreign women by helping them \nindirectly through a charitable non-governmental organization. He testified that if placed \nin the untenable position of having to choose between the interests of the United States \nand the interests of his female friends in the Philippines, he would choose the United \nStates. Even so, the Government need not wait to see what Applicant would do in such \na situation. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until \nan applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or \nrevoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. \n29, 2009), (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is \na strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont \nv. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at \nthis time.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",
