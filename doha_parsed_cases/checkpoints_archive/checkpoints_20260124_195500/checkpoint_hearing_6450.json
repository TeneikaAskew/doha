HARVEY \n \n \nAPPEARANCES \n \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nAlison O\u2019Connell, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant was born in the United States; however, he returned to Taiwan when he was \nfive weeks old, where he grew to an adult. In 2000, after he completed his 2-years of mandatory \nmilitary service in the Taiwan military, he returned to the United States. He visited Taiwan in \n2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006. He has retained his Taiwan passport. His parents are citizens \nand residents of Taiwan. His spouse is a citizen of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), and a \npermanent resident of the United States. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of the PRC. Although he has substantial connections to the United States, foreign \npreference and foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated.    \n \n \n                                                                                                                                         \n1\n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn August 3, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On \nJune 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to him, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether his security clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer dated June 25, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), dated August 20, 2007, was provided to him on August 28, 2007, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation.4 Submissions were due by September 27, 2007.5 Applicant did not provide any \nsubmissions. The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2007. \n \n \nPROCEDURAL RULING \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in the FORM concerning \nthe PRC and Taiwan (FORM at page 2-9). Department Counsel also provided supporting \ndocuments to show the basis for the facts in the FORM (Ex. I to XIV\u2014listed in FORM at 8-9). \nApplicant did not object to me taking administrative notice.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. \n02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). \n                                                          \n1Item 6 (Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application, EPSQ Version 2.2,, dated August 3, \n2004). There is no allegation of falsification of this SF 86. \n \n2On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing \napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January \n1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines apply to this case. \n \n3Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, dated June 25, 2007).  \n \n4Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated August 21, 2007, and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is dated August 28, 2007.  \n \n5Id. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to \nsubmit information.  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n3\nThe most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are \neither well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took \nadministrative notice of the facts under subheading \u201cTaiwan\u201d of this decision, which are derived \nfrom the FORM and Exhibits I to XIV. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted his connections to Taiwan and the PRC \nwith explanations. He also described substantial connections to the United States. His admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nof record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 33 years old.6 He was born in the United States. His grandmother took him \nto Taiwan when he was five months old. He served in Taiwan\u2019s Coast Guard from 1998 to 2000. \nTaiwan law requires two years of Taiwan military service. He first learned of his U.S. citizenship \nwhen he was 25 years old after completing one year of Taiwan military service. In 2002, after \nreturning to the United States, he received a Master of Science degree from a U.S. university. He \nmarried in May 2004. His son was born in the United States in July 2005. He and his wife are \nexpecting their second child to be born in November 2007. He has not served in the U.S. military \nand has not registered with the U.S. selective service system. He traveled to Taiwan in 2001, \n2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006.  He traveled to the PRC in 2006. His trips to Taiwan and the PRC \nwere to visit family, and not for any political activities.  \n \nApplicant received a Taiwan passport in 2000, and it expires on October 31, 2010. He \ncontinues to maintain his Taiwan passport because it allows him to stay in Taiwan more than 30 \ndays without a visa. He does not intend to renew his Taiwan passport after 2010. The FORM at \npage 12 notes that one Foreign Influence mitigating condition would be for Applicant to destroy, \nsurrender, or otherwise invalidate his Taiwan passport. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. \nHe did not offer to destroy, surrender, or otherwise invalidate his Taiwan passport prior to its \nexpiration date in 2010 (although he did indicate he did not intend to renew it). He used his U.S. \npassport for his visit to Taiwan in 2006; however, he used his Taiwan passport for his visit to \nTaiwan in 2005 (Item 5 at 4).   \n \nApplicant met his future wife when they were both attending the same U.S. university. \nShe received her undergraduate degree from a Chinese university. His wife had no connection \nwith the Chinese government. His wife is currently a U.S. permanent resident. She will become a \nU.S. citizen at the end of 2008 after she completes the required three years as a U.S. permanent \nresident.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His father has substantial \nconnections to the United States. His father attended a U.S. university, and worked for five years \nin the United States.  His parents do not work for the Taiwan government, and are not involved \nin Taiwan\u2019s political activities, except to vote. During the past seven years, his mother has \n                                                          \n6Item 4, supra n. 3, is the source for all the Findings of Facts unless otherwise stated.   \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n4\n                                                          \nvisited Applicant\u2019s family and his sister in the United States every year. His father intends to \nvisit Applicant\u2019s family in 2007.   \n       \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister have manifested significant connections to the United \nStates. She graduated from a U.S. university in 2005, and returned to Taiwan for two years \nbecause she could not find an employer who would sponsor her H-1 visa. She intends to begin \nher PhD program in August 2007 at a U.S. university. Her brother will begin attending a U.S. \nuniversity for his graduate studies in August 2007. Both of his siblings intend to remain in the \nUnited States after completing their studies.      \n      \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are PRC citizens and residents. They are \nretired. Neither of them are PRC government employees or involved in political activities. His \nmother-in-law stayed in the United States with Applicant\u2019s family for a year (2005-2006). \nApplicant plans to apply for U.S. permanent residency for his in-laws after his wife becomes a \nU.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant and his spouse plan to remain in the United States, raise their children as U.S. \ncitizens, and eventually to retire in the United States.  He has substantial U.S. financial interests, \nand owns a U.S. home.  He is proud of his U.S. citizenship and is loyal to the United States. \n \n \n Taiwan7  \n \nIn 1949, a large number of Chinese war refugees emigrated to Taiwan, and established a \ngovernment separate and independent from the mainland government. The PRC continues to \nrefuse recognition of Taiwan\u2019s independence, and insists that there is only \u201cone China.\u201d In 1979, \nthe United States recognized the PRC as the sole legal government of China. The United States \nis committed to a \u201cone-China policy,\u201d under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.   \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy with a strong economy. Taiwan maintains a large \nmilitary establishment primarily because of the PRC\u2019s threats of military attack. The PRC and \nTaiwan are active collectors of U.S. economic intelligence, and Taiwan and the PRC have \nattempted to acquire export-restricted products.   \n \nSeveral incidents (unrelated to Applicant) illustrate a potential security concern involving \nTaiwan and/or the PRC. Several individuals have been convicted and sentenced to prison terms \non charges related to the theft of sensitive or proprietary information for Taiwan companies or \nthe PRC.  \n \n \n \nThe PRC maintains active intelligence operations in Taiwan utilizing PRC nationals with \nTaiwan connections. The PRC is a nuclear power with vast resources, and the PRC aggressively \ncompetes with the United States in a variety of areas. The PRC\u2019s competitive relationship with \nthe United States exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s connections to Taiwan. \n \n \n \n \n \n7The contents of the Taiwan section are from the FORM and Exhibits I to XIV, as indicated in the \nProcedural Ruling. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n5\nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief introductory explanations for each AG, and \nprovide specific disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \n \n \nThese AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, an administrative judge should apply the AGs in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge \nshould consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors: \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \n \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final \ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nnational security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which \ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.8 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9\n                                                          \n8 Facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, \n383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n6\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. This special relationship \nrequires a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nThe scope of my decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about foreign preference, stating, \u201cwhen an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United \nStates, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to \nthe interests of the United States.\u201d Conditions under AG \u00b6 10 that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case include: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. \nThis includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such \nbenefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n9\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] \nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n7\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country;   \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American \ncitizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve \nthe interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or government in conflict \nwith the national security interest; and, \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the \nUnited States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United States \ncitizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in the United States. His \ngrandmother took him to Taiwan, where he was raised, received educational benefits, performed \nmilitary service, and exercised other attributes of Taiwan citizenship. He retained a Taiwan \npassport after immigrating back to the United States in 2000, and used it as recently as 2005 to \nenter Taiwan. Disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1)-10a(3) apply. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 11, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred \nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \n  \nApplicant continues to retain his Taiwan passport. None of the mitigating conditions \napply with respect to his use of a Taiwan passport after his residence changed to the United \nStates (2002 to 2005) and continued possession of a Taiwan passport. The cognizant security \nauthority did not authorize him to use the Taiwan passport. His other foreign preference security \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n8\nconcerns are mitigated because he was brought to Taiwan when he was a baby and had no real \nchoice about receiving benefits from Taiwan or providing military service to Taiwan. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating, \n\u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she] may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \nthat is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case include: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that \ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that the \nindividual\u2019s access to protected information may involve unacceptable risk to \nnational security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation; \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, or \nemployee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting \nto increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and, \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n9\n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the \nindividual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country. \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006, and he traveled to the \nPRC in 2006. He had contact with family members living in Taiwan and the PRC.  Family \nmembers also visited Applicant in the United States. The mere possession of close family ties \nwith a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nHowever, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that \nrelative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts and close relationships with his parents, who are \nresidents and citizens of Taiwan, and his siblings, who are citizens of Taiwan. His close \nrelationship with his parents, creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because PRC agents reside in Taiwan and actively seek intelligence, classified and \neconomic information from United States\u2019 businesses. His connections to his Taiwanese parents \nalso create a potential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern about his desire to help his parents or Taiwan by providing sensitive or \nclassified information. The disqualifying conditions outlined in AG \u00b6\u00b6 9(a) and 9(b) apply.   \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. As \npreviously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. AG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, \nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are \napproved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n10\n                                                          \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or \norganizations from a foreign country; and, \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used \neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his siblings] and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close relationships with his Taiwanese family members and \nhis PRC in-laws could potentially force him to choose between the United States and the PRC or \nTaiwan. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships \nwith his siblings] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d He has lived in the United States since 2002. He is a U.S. citizen from \nhis birth in the United States. His wife plans to become a U.S. citizen, and his son was born in \nthe United States. His next child will be born in the United States. Other relatives are in the \nprocess to moving to the United States, and/or becoming permanent U.S. residents and/or U.S. \ncitizens. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies because he has no interest in property in Taiwan or the PRC and he \nhas significant U.S. property and assets. Although these two mitigating conditions are partially or \nfully applicable, they are insufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed \npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative AGs related to the whole person concept \nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not \nconsider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the \nJudge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d10 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors \n(APF) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth \nAPF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the \nmost relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.11 In addition to the eighth APF, other \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860 \n(2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed \nin isolation). \n \n11 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth \nAPF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) \n(remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for exploitation\u201d), but see ISCR \nCase No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that eighth APF is exclusive circumstance in \nwhole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n11\n\u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. Ultimately, the clearance \ndecision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s \npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his \n[or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant has lived in the United States for approximately five years and has been a U.S. citizen \nfrom birth. His spouse is a permanent U.S. resident and plans to become a U.S. citizen next year. \nHis son is a U.S. citizen by birth, and his next child will be a U.S. citizen. Other family members \nare in the process of enhancing their connections to the United States. His ties to these family \nmembers are stronger than his ties to family members in Taiwan or the PRC. His closest family \nmembers are his wife and son. They live with him. Because his wife and son live in the United \nStates, they are not vulnerable to direct coercion or exploitation by a foreign power. The realistic \npossibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress with regard to his wife and son are low. \nHe owns his U.S. home, and his U.S. financial interests are significant. He has no financial \ninterests in Taiwan or the PRC. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could \ncause potential harm to the United States. His response to the FORM credibly articulates his \nstrong loyalty to the United States.   \n \n \nFive circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First, the PRC \nis a nuclear power and PRC\u2019s government is a rival of the United States. More importantly for \nsecurity purposes, the PRC and Taiwan actively seek classified and industrial/economic \ninformation. They may attempt to use his family living in Taiwan or his in-laws living in the \nPRC to obtain such information. Second, he had significant connections to Taiwan before he \nreturned to the United States. He was raised to adult, and served in the Taiwanese military for \ntwo years. Third, his siblings and parents are Taiwanese citizens, and his parents still live in \nTaiwan. His in-laws are citizens and residents in the PRC. Fourth, he has frequent and non-\ncasual contact with his family members in Taiwan and his in-laws in the PRC. In the last seven \nyears, he visited Taiwan five times, and the PRC once in 2006. His contacts with family \nmembers and in-laws are manifestations of his affection and regard for them. Fifth, he retained a \nTaiwan passport. After receipt of the FORM, containing notification of the security concerns \nregarding his Taiwan passport, he did not divest himself of his Taiwan passport.    \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it is deemed best to err \non the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] \nclearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign \npreference or foreign influence. Ultimately, the evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility and suitability.   \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n12\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and supporting evidence, my \napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the AGs. See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 006). \nApplicant has not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nDECISION \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant.

On June 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline J and Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 15, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 24, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 16, 2007. The case\nwas assigned to me on November 28, 2007, to make a decision as to whether it was\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for\nApplicant. On December 10, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for January 23, 2008.\n\n2\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on January 23, 2008. Two government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-2) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C, Exhibit B over the government\u2019s\nobjection) were admitted, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived by DOHA on February 1, 2008. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, pertinent federal statutes and case law, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel requested administrative notice of federal\nstatutes and case law pertinent to the Military Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\n451 et seq., and of information published by the Selective Service System concerning\nconscientious objection and alternative service, prohibitions on registering after age 26,\nand federal benefits and programs available only to registrants. Applicant objected to\nconsidering the information from the Selective Service System based on its publication\nafter the requirement to register for him had expired. I agreed to take administrative\nnotice of applicable federal statutes, the case law concerning whether the failure to\nregister was a continuing offense, and the information furnished by the Selective\nService System, but I will also take into account the general nature of the information\nprovided by the Selective Service System.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J and Guideline E that Applicant willfully failed to\nregister with the Selective Service Act as required by 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 453. Applicant\nadmitted he failed to register as alleged under Guideline J but denied it was willful (\u201cI\ndeny that my actions were \u2018willful\u2019 because of my confusion and ignorance of the proper\nway to assert conscientious objector status with the Selective Service\u201d). Applicant\ndisputed the Guideline E concern on the basis that his failure to register occurred many\nyears ago when he was a young man. After consideration of the evidence of record, I\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a senior imaging engineer who has worked for his current employer,\na defense contractor, since May 2004. His employer designs and manufactures\ncomputer tomography (CT) scanners for automatic detection of explosives and\nweapons, and Applicant seeks a secret-level security clearance for his complex\ntechnical work in developing algorithms (Ex. A). He has never held a clearance (Tr. 64).\n    \nApplicant was born in February 1961. During his youth, all males in the U.S.\nbetween the ages of 18 and 26 were required to register with the Selective Service\nSystem (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 451 et seq.):\nExcept as otherwise provided in this title, it shall be the duty of every male\ncitizen of the United States, and every other male person now or hereafter\n\n3\nin the United States, who, on the day or days fixed for the first or any\nsubsequent registration, is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six,\nto present himself for and submit to registration at such time or times and\nplace or places, and in such manner, as shall be determined by\nproclamation of the President and by rules and regulations prescribed\nhereunder. \n50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 453. Effective March 29, 1975, U.S. President Ford terminated the\nprocedures for registration under the Military Selective Service Act. When Applicant\nturned 18 in February 1979, there was no requirement to register.\nOn July 2, 1980, U.S. President Carter, by proclamation, ordered male citizens\nand male resident aliens, who were born on or after January 1, 1960, and had attained\ntheir 18  birthday, to register with the Selective Service System unless otherwise\nth\nexempt. Registration was to commence on July 21, 1980, with male persons born in\n1961 to present themselves for registration on any of the six days beginning Monday,\nJuly 28, 1980. Covered males born on or after January 1, 1963, had 60 days to register\n(from 30 days before to 30 days after reaching age 18). Under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 462(a), the\nknowing failure, neglect, or refusal to perform any duty required under the Selective\nService Act was punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to five years and/or a fine\nof not more than $10,000.\nApplicant, then a college student on summer break, knew of his obligation to\nregister with the Selective Service and he did not register (Tr. 54-55, 64-65). During the\nsummer, he received a letter from an acquaintance encouraging him to not register.\nApplicant began to consider whether he could kill someone, and he did not want to risk\nbeing placed in a battle situation. In 1980 and 1981, Applicant contacted an\norganization of conscientious objectors and inquired as to whether there was any way\nthat he could avoid combat. They had no answer for him (Tr. 71). Aware that the\ngovernment had not granted conscientious objector status to those who avoided the\ndraft (Tr. 57-58, 72), Applicant took a \u201cwait and see attitude,\u201d even while he feared\nprosecution (\u201cI kept saying to myself, well, if I was prosecuted, I guess I would have to, I\nwould have to register.\u201d Tr. 55):\nI believed that the government should have made some provisions for\nregistering as a conscientious objector, there was [sic] no provisions, and I\nbelieved at the time that if I didn\u2019t register, and maybe it would change,\nthere would be something that would happen over time where, you know,\nthey would start allowing people to register as a conscientious objector\n(Tr. 59).\n\nApplicant\u2019s belief came from the lack of any efforts to prosecute him. He was unaware that the Government\n1\nhad a passive enforcement policy of prosecuting only those who report themselves or who were reported by\nothers as having violated the registration requirement (Tr. 76-77). See Wayte v. U.S., 470 U.S. 598 (1985).\n4\nOver the next year or so, it became clear to him there would be no criminal\nconsequences for his failure to register.  Applicant continued his education without\n1\nmuch thought to his failure to register as the years passed, although on occasion he\nwas reminded through posted signs of the requirement to register for all males between\n18 and 26 years of age. See Tr. 54-59, 64-65, 73, 78.\nIn 1982, the Selective Service Act was amended under Public Law 97-252 to\nprovide that those persons who fail to comply with the registration requirement are\nineligible for any form of assistance or benefit (loans, grants, or work assistance)\nprovided under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 for instruction beginning after\nJune 30, 1983 (50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 453(f)(1)). In November 1985, a statutory bar to\nemployment with the executive branch of the federal government was enacted for those\npersons who were required to register under the Selective Service Act and who\nknowingly and willfully had not registered before the requirement terminated or became\ninapplicable to them (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3328). In November 1986, pursuant to Public Law 99-\n661, the Selective Service Act was amended to make some non-registrants eligible for\neducational assistance and other federal benefits: \n(g) A person may not be denied a right, privilege, or benefit under Federal\nLaw by reason of failure to present himself for and submit to registration\nunder section 3 [section 453 of this Appendix] if--\n(1) the requirement for the person to so register has terminated or\nbecome inapplicable to the person; and\n(2) the person shows by the preponderance of the evidence that\nthe failure of the person to register was not a knowing and willful\nfailure to register.\n50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(g). \nIn 1983, Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in physics (Tr. 61, Ex. C). He\npursued graduate studies in physics through teaching and then research fellowships\n(Tr. 62). When his source of funding ran out, Applicant applied for a federal guaranteed\nstudent loan in 1990. His application was denied because he could not produce a\nregistration number with the Selective Service. Applicant maintains he would have\nregistered at that time but was not allowed to do so because he was over 26 (Tr. 45, 67,\nAnswer). Applicant was awarded his doctorate degree in physics in 1991 (Tr. 62, Ex. C).\nIn June 1991, Applicant and his spouse married. From 1992 to 1994, Applicant\nwas a postdoctoral research fellow at a university (Ex. C). From September 1994 to\nAugust 1996, Applicant pursued a master\u2019s degree in media arts and sciences while\n\n5\nstarting a family.  His has two daughters, who were born in August 1995 and July 1997\n(Ex. 1).\nIn 1997, Applicant founded a video and still image processing software start-up\nbusiness with venture capital funding. During 1998, he worked as a software engineer\nfor a company where he wrote special effects plug-ins for video post production. From\nAugust 1999 to April 2004 he was employed as a senior software engineer by another\ncommercial firm (Ex. 1). He designed and implemented image processing filters and\noptical flow algorithms (Ex. C).\nApplicant began working for his present employer as a senior imaging engineer\nin May 2004 (Ex. 1, Ex. C). Applicant\u2019s work in algorithm development for X-ray and CT\nscanners is largely unclassified (Tr. 64, Ex. A, Ex. C), but the resulting scanner is tested\nagainst a classified performance standard (Ex. A). At the request of his employer,\nApplicant applied for a secret clearance by completing an electronic questionnaire for\ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) on September 28, 2006 (Ex. 1). Applicant admitted in\nresponse to question 20.b that he had not registered with the Selective Service System,\nand stated, \u201cI chose not to register with selective service because I was a conscientious\nobjector to war. I was opposed to all killing because of my religious and moral beliefs.\u201d\n(Ex. 1).\nApplicant now regrets his failure to register with the Selective Service System,\nprimarily because his conduct was unfair to those registrants who complied with their\nobligation (\u201cI\u2019m sorry because I know it\u2019s unfair, it\u2019s unfair to think that I was different\nthan every other man of my age. If I could do it, if I could do it, if I could, if I could\nregister now, I certainly would, I want to serve my country.\u201d Tr. 80). He is not proud of\nhis noncompliance (Tr. 66, 81).\nHis employer\u2019s vice president for engineering is aware of Applicant\u2019s\ncontributions since May 2004 and he has had the opportunity to assess Applicant\u2019s\nwork directly since August 2006. He vouches for Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nhonesty, and trustworthiness (Ex. A).\nApplicant has been a member of his religious congregation for the past eight\nyears. He has shown himself to be a trustworthy contributor. Applicant informed his\nrabbi of his failure to register with the Selective Service System when he was 19. She\nconsiders him to be a mature and reliable adult who \u201crecognizes his mistake and is duly\nrepentant\u201d (Ex. B). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG\n\u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\n\n50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(d) provides:\n2\nNo person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for evading, neglecting, or refusing to\nperform the duty of registering imposed by section 3 of this title (section 453 of this Appendix)\nunless the indictment is found within five years next after the last day before such person\nattains the age of twenty-six, or within five years next after the last day before such person\ndoes perform his duty to register, whichever shall first occur.\n7\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d Every male U.S. citizen between the ages of\n18 and 26 is required to register under the Selective Service Act in the manner\ndetermined by proclamation of the President. The President determined that persons\nrequired to register under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 453, born in calendar year 1961 were\nrequired to present themselves for registration on any of the six days beginning\nMonday, July 28, 1980. Exec. Proc. 4771, 45 F.R. 45247, 94 Stat. 3775 (1980). Since\nhe was born in February 1961, Applicant was required to register with the Selective\nService on any of those six days. By his own admission, Applicant was notified of the\nrequirement to register and chose to not do so. Applicant could have registered late until\nhis 26  birthday in February 1987, and he did not do so.\nth\nCiting ISCR Case No. 01-23890 (A.J. Mar. 18, 2003), Applicant proffered \u201ca\ntechnical argument\u201d against violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 453 because there was no\nrequirement to register in 1979 when he turned 18 (Tr. 44-45). While both he and the\napplicant in ISCR Case No. 01-23890 were born in 1961 and therefore were not\nrequired to register with the Selective Service in 1979, the government is not repeating\nthe mistake of ISCR Case No. 01-23890 and alleging here that Applicant violated the\nSelective Service Act by not registering within 30 days of his 18  birthday. Rather, the\nth\ngovernment\u2019s position is that Applicant was required to register with the Selective\nService on any of the six days beginning Monday, July 28, 1980, and that late\nregistration would have been accepted until he turned 26.  In ISCR Case No. 01-23890,\nDOHA Administrative Judge Gales recognized this requirement to register for males\nborn in 1961, and concluded the applicant in his case had a \u201ccontinuing duty\u201d to register\nwith the Selective Service commencing July 28, 1980, until his 26  birthday, but that the\nth\nuncharged conduct was mitigated by the passage of time and absence of willful\ndisregard. Applicant\u2019s case is factually distinguishable in that he knew he had a duty to\nregister and did not do so.\nApplicant committed serious criminal conduct by his knowing and willful\nnoncompliance with 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 453. Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462, Applicant\ncould have been prosecuted for failure to register, and if convicted, sentenced to up to\nfive years in a prison and/or a substantial fine.   Furthermore, the statutory bars from\n2\nfederal executive agency employment under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3328 and from eligibility for\nfederal educational assistance under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(f)(1), confirm the\nseriousness with which the failure to register is viewed by the government. Under\nGuideline J, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses\u201d) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted\u201d) apply.\n\n8\nEven serious criminal conduct may be mitigated by the passage of time, provided\nit is not likely to recur and no longer casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nor trustworthiness (see AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d)). As to whether the failure to register should be viewed as a completed\noffense at the expiration of the six-day period established for registration by Presidential\nProclamation 4771 or as a continuing offense until he turned 26, the Selective Service\nregulations effective in 1980 do not contain a provision imposing a continuing duty to\nregister. The Tenth Circuit has held it a single offense (see U.S. v. Harmon, 486 F.2d\n363 (1973)), although other federal appellate courts have more recently interpreted \u00a7\n462(d) in conjunction with \u00a7 453 to conclude that Congress intended failure to register to\nbe a continuing offense. See, e.g., U.S. v. Eklund, 733 F.2d 1287 (8  Cir. 1984)\nth\n(offense is not complete until the statute of limitations begins to run, which for those who\nnever file is at age 26);U.S. v. Kerley, 838 F. 2d 932 (7  Cir. 1988). Even DOHA\nth\nadministrative judges have disagreed. See ISCR Case No. 01-2380, supra; ISCR Case\nNo. 03-02799 (A.J. Young, Jul. 26, 2004) (refusal to register for draft within 60 days of\napplicant\u2019s 18  birthday an isolated act). I am inclined to agree with those federal courts\nth\nthat have imposed a continuing duty. Even so, 20 years have passed since the\nrequirement to register applied to Applicant. Moreover, the offense cannot recur as a\nmatter of law. AG \u00b6 32(a) partially applies because of the passage of time and he is no\nlonger subject to the registration requirement. However, his deliberate disregard for the\nlaw continues to cast doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nSuccessful rehabilitation encompasses several factors, including \u201cpassage of\ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or rehabilitation, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 32(d). Applicant has a record of significant educational achievement and stable\nemployment. He has also been involved in his religious congregation for the past eight\nyears. The failure to register with the Selective Service is the only blemish on his record\nof productive citizenship, but it is a very serious concern. The Government recognizes\nthat some individuals are conscientiously opposed to fighting wars, and has made\nspecific provisions for avoiding combat by applying for conscientious objector status.\nApplicant did not apply for conscientious objector status.\nStatutory bars to federal employment and to eligibility for federal student loans\nwere enacted after Applicant was required to register, although before the requirement\nbecame inapplicable to him. There is no evidence that Applicant knew of these\nconsequences until his student loan application was denied in 1991, but the government\nmust be assured that those with classified access can be counted on to fulfill their\nobligations even when there are no negative consequences for failure to do so.\nApplicant now expresses regret over his failure to register (\u201cI know what I did was\nwrong.\u201d Tr. 43), and he cannot as a matter of law repeat the same criminal conduct.\nHowever, his failure to provide a consistent, credible explanation for his failure to\nregister between July 28, 1980, and his 26  birthday in February 1987, precludes me\nth\nfrom finding that he is successfully rehabilitated.\n\n9\nWhen he completed his SF 86 in September 2006, Applicant indicated that he\nhad made a choice in not registering with the Selective Service because he was a\nconscientious objector. Yet, when he answered the SOR, Applicant denied that his\nconduct was willful, and asserted \u201cconfusion and ignorance of the proper way to assert\nconscientious objector status with the Selective Service.\u201d At his hearing, Applicant never\nexplained why he did not register during the six days set forth for registration by\nproclamation. He testified that late in summer 1980, he received a letter from an\nacquaintance urging him not to register, and it was then that he began to think about\nconscientious objector status (Tr. 54-55). He decided not to register because he\nobjected to the government\u2019s failure to exempt or otherwise provide for registration as a\nconscientious objector (see Tr. 59). As for his failure to register by his 26  birthday,\nth\nApplicant initially indicated that during the year or so after he should have registered, he\nfeared prosecution (\u201cI kept saying to myself, well, if I was prosecuted, I guess I would\nhave to, I would have to register.\u201d (Tr. 55)). This suggests Applicant knew he could have\nregistered late. After it became clear to him that the government wasn\u2019t going to\nprosecute, Applicant claimed he gave it little thought (\u201ccompletely fallen off his radar\u201d\n(Tr. 78-79)). While the requirement to register was likely not something that kept\nApplicant awake at night (Tr. 80), it is difficult to believe that he never gave it another\nthought, especially where he had seen publicly posted reminders of the requirement to\nregister (Tr. 78). His explanation for failing to register despite these reminders, \u201cit just\ndidn\u2019t occur that it applied to me . . . Well, I thought it was, it was, you know, that it was\na done deal\u201d (Tr. 79), is inconsistent with his testimony that he would have registered to\navoid a credible threat of prosecution. Furthermore, it would require a finding of naivete\nthat the record does not support. By his 26  birthday, Applicant was well into his\nth\ngraduate studies toward a doctorate in physics. Had he any intent to comply with his\nobligation, he would have at least inquired into the procedures.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant acknowledges that he exercised poor judgment by not registering with\nthe Selective Service. His conduct falls within the general security concern underlying\nGuideline E, but none of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 apply to his failure\nto register. The government\u2019s reliance on AG \u00b6 16(c) is not well taken in the absence of\nevidence of credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline. The\nonly adverse information of security concern is the failure to register with the Selective\n\n10\nService, which is sufficient for an adverse determination under Guideline J in the\nabsence of successful rehabilitation. The record does not support any concerns of\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress (see AG \u00b6 16(e)(\u201cpersonal conduct,\nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing\u201d)). Applicant\ndisclosed his failure to register with the Selective Service when he applied for his\nsecurity clearance (Ex. 1), and to his rabbi (Ex. B). The security concerns raised by\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate disregard of the registration requirement are more appropriately\nconsidered under Guideline J.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. There is no statutory bar to holding\na security clearance by those males who deliberately defy the requirement to register\nwith the Selective Service. Since he was only 19 when ordered to register by\nPresidential proclamation, his immaturity (see AG \u00b6 2(4)) must be considered but it\ndoes not excuse his failure to comply with his ongoing duty to rectify his misconduct by\nregistering before his 26  birthday. As the criminal penalties for a violation reflect, failure\nth\nto register is viewed as very serious (see AG \u00b6 2(a)). Applicant\u2019s decision not to register\nwas premeditated, deliberate, and repeated over the years. He failed to comply with an\nimportant obligation of citizenship. Congress and the President specifically emphasized\nthis obligation by statutory bars to federal employment and student loans. Such bars are\nnot in place for many felonies with similar penalties.\nApplicant\u2019s personal and work accomplishments are indicators of reform (see AG\n\u00b6 2(a)(6)) but he has not yet shown that he can fulfill his obligations without regard to his\n\n11\nself-interest. While he provided character references who vouch for his good character,\nintegrity, and work ethic, I did not find his testimony at his hearing about his reasons for\nnot registering to be credible. His efforts to excuse or minimize his defiance of the law\nshow he is unwilling to accept full responsibility for his conduct. In response to the SOR,\nhe stated, \u201cI believe I was poorly counseled before making my decision.\u201d But at his\nhearing, he testified that the organization for conscientious objectors that he consulted\nin 1980 and 1981 \u201ccouldn\u2019t really tell [him] what to do.\u201d (Tr. 71). Given the concerns for\nhis credibility, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                            \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Her admissions in her answer to the 3 SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 51-year-old senior electrical designer for a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer and held a security clearance since July 1997. Her clearance was suspended in June 2007 (GX 3 at 1; Tr. 12). She studied electrical architecture in college for four years but was a few credits short of the requirements for a degree (Tr. 11-12). She was married in November 1984 and has three children. A coworker who has worked for Applicant\u2019s employer for 25 years, holds a security clearance, and has worked with Applicant for five years described her as hard- working, very religious, devoted to her family, very frugal, and having a \u201cheart of gold.\u201d The witness testified he was unaware of any security violations during the past five years, but that Applicant is the kind of person who would self-report any security violation (Tr. 30-37). Another coworker who has worked for Applicant\u2019s employer for 26 years, holds a security clearance, and known her for three years described her as a reliable person who \u201ckeeps to herself.\u201d The witness would not hesitate to recommend Applicant for a security clearance (Tr. 43).

On \nNovember 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 28, 2007; answered it \non December 15, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on December 20, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on January 31, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on February 14, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 20, 2008, scheduling it for February 28, \n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 19 \nMay 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, \npresented the testimony of three witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough D, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until March 14, 2008 to enable her to submit additional evidence. On \nMarch 14, 2008 Applicant timely submitted AX E and F, and requested additional time \nto submit evidence. The request for an extension of time and my response extending \nthe deadline until March 28, 2008, are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. \nApplicant timely submitted AX G and H. Her additional evidence was admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX E through H is attached to the record \nas HX II. Applicant\u2019s rebuttal to HX II is attached as HX III. The record closed on March \n28, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 10, 2008, but it \nwas incomplete. A corrected transcript was requested on April 25, 2008, and received \non April 30, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice of Hearing \n \n \nThe written hearing notice was dated February 20, 2008, and the hearing \nconvened on February 28, 2008, giving Applicant less than the 15-day notice to which \nshe is entitled under the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. Before the formal hearing notice was \nissued, she had discussed the hearing date and exchanged email with Department \nCounsel, and agreed to schedule the case for February 28, 2008.  She waived the 15-\nday notice requirement, with the understanding she would be given additional time after \nthe hearing to submit documents (Tr. 8-9). As noted above, the record was held open \nuntil March 28, 2008, and she timely submitted additional evidence. Her last \nsubmission, dated March 27, 2008, affirmatively stated, \u201cWe will not be submitting any \nmore documents and eagerly await your decision.\u201d \n \nUnauthenticated Reports of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered two personal subject interviews (GX 16 and 17 \nextracted from reports of investigation, without presenting an authenticating witness as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, \nand she affirmatively waived it (Tr. 51-54). \n \nCredit Reports \n \n \nApplicant objected to six credit reports (GX 6 through 11), because they were \noutdated. I overruled the objection but explained to Applicant that she was free to \npresent more recent credit reports or contradict the information in GX 6 through 11. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g. Her admissions in her answer to the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following \nfindings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old senior electrical designer for a defense contractor. She \nhas worked for her current employer and held a security clearance since July 1997. Her \nclearance was suspended in June 2007 (GX 3 at 1; Tr. 12). She studied electrical \narchitecture in college for four years but was a few credits short of the requirements for \na degree (Tr. 11-12). She was married in November 1984 and has three children.  \n \n \nA coworker who has worked for Applicant\u2019s employer for 25 years, holds a \nsecurity clearance, and has worked with Applicant for five years described her as hard-\nworking, very religious, devoted to her family, very frugal, and having a \u201cheart of gold.\u201d  \nThe witness testified he was unaware of any security violations during the past five \nyears, but that Applicant is the kind of person who would self-report any security \nviolation (Tr. 30-37). \n \n \nAnother coworker who has worked for Applicant\u2019s employer for 26 years, holds a \nsecurity clearance, and known her for three years described her as a reliable person \nwho \u201ckeeps to herself.\u201d The witness would not hesitate to recommend Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance (Tr. 43). \n \n \nApplicant and her husband moved to the Northeast U.S. in 1988, where they \nboth worked for a defense contractor. They found the cost of living very expensive. \nApplicant\u2019s husband handled the family finances, including filing income tax returns, and \nhe decided to increase their federal income tax exemptions to \u201c99,\u201d resulting in no taxes \nbeing withheld from their paychecks.  \n \nApplicant signed the joint returns but was unaware of her husband\u2019s action to \navoid tax withholding (Tr. 75). When they filed their returns, she asked her husband why \nthey owed so much money to the Internal Revenue Service, and she accepted his \nvague explanation about owing a lot of money because they made a lot of money. She \ndoes not like to be involved with money (Tr. 107).  \n \nBecause no taxes were withheld, Applicant and her husband were unable to pay \nthe federal income taxes due when they filed their returns for tax years 1989 and 1992 \nthrough 2000, resulting in the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. They made \nperiodic payments over the years, reducing the amount due from about $140,688 (GX \n13) to about $75,662 (AX D). Applicant\u2019s husband testified they had been unable to \nnegotiate a payment plan, because the IRS insisted on monthly payments of $4,000, \nwhich they could not afford (Tr. 65, 75). In January 2008 they made an offer in \ncompromise for $15,000. However, as of the date the record closed, they had not \nreceived a response (Tr. 88).  \n \nApplicant and her husband did not pay state income taxes for the years 1992 to \n1995, resulting in the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (GX 14; GX 16 at 2). They moved to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nanother state in 1997, and a wage garnishment for $1,679 was filed by this state against \nApplicant\u2019s pay (GX 12). This debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nDuring the years 2000 to 2004, Applicant\u2019s husband gambled extensively. \nAccordingly to casino records, he lost $8,892 in 2000, lost $9,883 in 2001, won $16,065 \nin 2003, and lost $8,724 in 2004 (AX H). He testified Applicant tried to stop his gambling \n\u201cplenty of times,\u201d but without success (Tr. 80). Her husband testified he stopped \ngambling \u201ca couple of years ago,\u201d but he did not seek any counseling because he did \nnot believe he needed it (Tr. 83). Around 2003, when Applicant learned about her \nhusband\u2019s gambling, she took responsibility for the household accounts, but he \nremained responsible for filing the tax returns (Tr. 80-81). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was laid off in September 2003 and was unemployed until \nNovember 2003, and then he worked only for about a month because he was \nhospitalized for emergency heart surgery (AX C; Tr. 64). He was unable to work for five \nor six months after his surgery (Tr. 85). He worked for a defense contractor from \nDecember 2006 to May 2007, when he was laid off. He limited his work hours to 32 \nhours per week because of his health. He was unemployed in May and June 2007, was \nhired by a government contractor, and laid off again after three weeks. He has worked \nfor his current employer, a government contractor, since June 2007 (GX 4 at 8).  \n \n \nIn early 2004, Applicant and her husband made an offer in compromise, \nintending to pay their delinquent taxes with a $30,000 loan from her brother-in-law if the \noffer was accepted (Tr. 65; GX 5). They received the loan but their offer in compromise \nwas rejected. \n \n \nIn October 2004, Applicant and her husband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition. They listed total assets of $35,455 and liabilities of $327,519. They received a \ndischarge in January 2005 (GX 18 and 19). The tax debts were not discharged. Their \nbankruptcy petition and discharge are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n \nThe $30,000 loan from Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was not listed on the \nbankruptcy petition (GX 18) and apparently was not discharged. Applicant\u2019s husband \ntestified there is no fixed payment schedule for this debt, but they have continued to \nmake periodic payments totaling about $7,000 (Tr. 85). \n \n \nApplicant and her husband do not maintain a household budget (Tr. 87). Her \nhusband testified they pay their bills as they come in, and they have only $500 left at the \nend of the month (Tr. 66, 87). However, the evidence about their financial situation is \nconflicting. In July 2006, Applicant told a security investigator that they had a net \nmonthly remainder of about $5,000. She also told the investigator she has about \n$15,000 in her 401(k) account and $4,000 in bank savings (GX 16 at 3). In August \n2007, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting total household \nincome of $9,666 per month, monthly expenses of $4,769, debt payments of $2,361, a \nnet remainder of $2,536, and savings of only $300 (GX 4 at 9).  \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant and her husband had made a $600 \npayment on the state tax garnishment for $1,679 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (AX E and F), \nsatisfied the state tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c (AX G at 2), and were awaiting a \nresponse to their offer in compromise of the federal income tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.e, and 1.f (AX D). They had disputed the credit card entry showing a delinquent \ncredit card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and the adverse credit report entry had been \ncorrected (AX G at 3).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  AG \u00b6 \n19(g) is raised by Afailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.@   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not \nraised because, while there is evidence of her husband\u2019s irresponsible gambling, there \nis no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending\u201d on her part. To the contrary, the \nevidence shows her to be frugal. \n \nIt appears Applicant was not aware of her husband\u2019s fraudulent tax scheme. She \nsigned the joint tax forms without examining them, even after discovering they owed \nlarge sums when they filed. Her passive participation in the tax fraud was culpably \nnegligent, but it does not raise AG \u00b6 19(g). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@  If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established, because the tax debts are still \nnot resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) also is not established because \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. The third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is \nnot established because Applicant remains passive about financial matters and \ncontinues to trust her husband to handle all tax matters. Her lack of attention to her tax \nsituation even after she suspected something was amiss casts doubt on her good \njudgment.  I conclude \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nThe financial problems caused by Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s compulsive gambling, \nperiods of unemployment, and serious illness were beyond her control. His tax fraud \nwas not beyond her control, because she chose not to exercise control. The unresolved \ndebts are all related to delinquent taxes, triggered by her husband\u2019s tax fraud and her \nfailure to examine the tax returns before signing them. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \nestablished.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Neither \nApplicant nor her husband has received counseling of any type, and their tax problems \nare not yet under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).   \n \nApplicant and her husband successfully settled the state tax lien alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. They have made periodic payments on their delinquent federal taxes for several \nyears but have been unable to negotiate a payment plan. Applicant\u2019s husband testified \nthey have a net monthly remainder of only about $500 and cannot afford the $4,000 \nmonthly payment demanded by the IRS. However, in July 2006 Applicant told a security \ninvestigator they had a monthly remainder of $5,000. In her personal financial statement \nin August 2007, she reported a monthly remainder of only $2,536. This conflicting \nfinancial information makes it impossible to determine whether Applicant and her \nhusband could have afforded the payment plan offered by the IRS. They have not \nreceived an answer to their offer in compromise. In light of the conflicting evidence \nregarding their financial situation, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nand her husband successfully disputed the credit report showing a delinquent credit \ncard debt and they provided documented proof that the dispute was resolved in their \nfavor. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant presented herself at the hearing as soft-spoken, somewhat shy, and \nsincere. She dislikes dealing with money. It was clear that her husband is the dominant \nfigure in the management of family finances, and she trusts him in spite of his track \nrecord of tax fraud and excessive gambling. She and her husband do not maintain a \nfamily budget, and they have no firm plan for resolving their tax situation if the offer in \ncompromise is rejected. Unless their tax situation is resolved, she will remain vulnerable \nto pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. She has entrusted resolution of the tax \ndebts to her husband, whose track record on financial management does not inspire \nconfidence. Given her personality and distaste for financial matters, it appears likely that \nshe will continue her passive, uninvolved approach to their tax situation. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On August 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline C (Foreign Preference) regarding Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 7, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing by a notarized document dated October 9, 2007. In his\nanswer, Applicant admitted all five allegations and waived his right to a hearing. A File\nof Relevant Materials (FORM), dated November 15, 2007, was received by Applicant\non November 21, 2007. The FORM included six documents attached as related items.\nApplicant did not submit any information within the time period of 30 days after his\n\n Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of both the U.S. and the United Kingdom. \n1\n See U.S. State Department Background Note: United Kingdom (Jan. 2008) and U.S. State Department\n2\nConsular Information Sheet (Dec. 12, 2007).\n2\nreceipt of the FORM and the record is now closed. DOHA received the case for\nassignment to an Administrative Judge for administrative determination on January 28,\n2008, and I was assigned the case that same day. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 71-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been with\nthe same company since December 1991 and currently serves as its Chairman of the\nBoard and Vice President. In his Answer to the SOR, signed by the Applicant and\nnotarized on October 9, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,\n1.c, 1.d, and 1.e of the SOR, without providing explanations or additional facts. Instead,\nhe responded to the allegations in seriatim, answering each by only stating: \u201cI admit.\u201d\nBecause he declined to add additional facts concerning his life or his admissions, there\nare scant facts of record.\nBorn in the United Kingdom in 1936, Applicant married his wife in 1962.  The\n1\ncouple has two grown children, both United States (U.S.) \u2013 United Kingdom dual\ncitizens. While working as a professor of social statistics at a university in the United\nKingdom, he received a Ph.D. in 1979. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\nDecember 1998, the same month he was issued a U.S. passport. He maintains dual\ncitizenship with both the United Kingdom and the U.S. \nApplicant has traveled extensively throughout the world. He has used his United\nKingdom passport for frequent short visits to the United Kingdom to visit his children\nand grandchildren. That passport was used as recently as April 2007. Set to expire on\nJanuary 31, 2008, he has been reluctant to surrender that passport. He uses his U.S.\npassport for all other travel. Applicant has not indicated when or whether his travel or\npassport use has been approved by his employer\u2019s security authority. \nSince 2001, Applicant has received a government pension from the United\nKingdom Department of Social Security. His September 2007 e-QIP indicates he has\nforeign property, business connections or financial interests; maintains bank accounts\nin the United Kingdom; is or has been employed by or acted as a consultant for a\nforeign government, firm, or agency; has contact with a foreign government, its\nestablishments, or its representatives other than on official U.S. government business,\ncurrently works in the area of statistics with Canadian and South African governments,\nand has worked in that same area with or in other countries. His international work in\nthe area of statistics is extensive and diverse.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts.  The United Kingdom is a\n2\nhighly developed constitutional democracy. It is politically stable, has a modern\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n5\n3\ninfrastructure, a highly developed market-based economy, and its legal system\nprovided the model for that used in the U.S. The United Kingdom is one of the U.S.\u2019\noldest and closest allies, and British foreign policy emphasizes close coordination with\nthe U.S. It was an ally in the Great War, World War II, the Korean conflict, the Persian\nGulf War, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Additionally, the United Kingdom is a founding\nmember of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It has a positive record in the areas\nof human rights and legal process. The government of the United Kingdom does not\nsupport or sponsor terrorism or terrorist organizations, but acts of terrorism have\noccurred within the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom works cooperatively with the\nU.S. in the fight against global terrorism. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\n3\nburden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate\n4\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision is on the applicant.  \n5\n\n Id.\n6\n Id.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n7\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n8\nSee AG \u00b6 9.\n9\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n6\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n7\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n8\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline and the security concern cited in AG \u00b6 9 to be the most pertinent to the\nevaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference. \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way\nas to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or\nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.\u201d  \n9\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\n\n In his e-QIP, Applicant also acknowledges he receives a retirement pension from the government of the\n10\nUnited Kingdom, a situation which could also give rise to FP DC a.3, AG \u00b6 10.a.3 (accepting educational,\nmedical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country).\n As previously noted, the record additionally shows Applicant receives a foreign pension and works in a\n11\nconsulting capacity with foreign entities. \n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nSecurity concerns relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference arise when an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the\nUnited States. In this event, he may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the United States. Here, Appellant has admitted that he possesses\nand uses a current United Kingdom passport. This admission gives rise to Foreign\nPreference (FP) Disqualifying Condition (DC) a.1, AG \u00b610.a.1 (possession of a current\nforeign passport).  \n10\nApplicant has not presented evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation\nsufficient to overcome the prima facie case against him. Indeed, he has presented\nneither facts nor argument beyond his direct admissions to the allegations. As noted in\nthe SOR and admitted by Applicant, he exercises dual citizenship and travels on a\nforeign passport.  Although a citizen of the United Kingdom by virtue of his birth and\n11\nparentage, he has purposefully maintained dual citizenship since becoming a U.S.\ncitizen and continued to reap the benefits of that citizenship. Consequently, FP\nMitigating Condition (MC) 1, AG \u00b6 11.1.a (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country) (emphasis added) does not apply. Applicant has\nnot addressed whether he is willing or unwilling to renounce dual citizenship, but he has\narticulated his reluctance to surrender his foreign passport. Continued use and\npossession of that passport is a fruit reaped form his dual citizenship. Therefore, FP\nMC 2, AG \u00b6 11.1.b (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship) does not apply. Moreover, that foreign passport was received when\nApplicant was an adult and after he became a U.S. citizen; he has since been reluctant\nto surrender this valid document. Consequently, neither FP MC 3, AG \u00b6 11.1.c\n(exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before\nthe individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor) nor FP MC 5,\nAG \u00b6 11.1.e (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated) apply. It only has been used for private family trips\nand no facts have been presented to indicate Applicant\u2019s passport use has been\napproved by a cognizant security authority. Therefore, FP MS 4, AG \u00b6 11.1.d (use of a\nforeign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority) does not apply. None\nof the other FP MCs apply.\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nHere, little is known about the Applicant because he has declined to expand the\nrecord beyond the documents contained in the FORM. What is known is that he is a\nmature, educated man whose work and expertise has taken him around the world. It\nalso shows that he is truly at home in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, with\nregard to his family, his investments, and his interests. He has freely exercised his\nrights and privileges as a dual citizen as a matter of personal convenience, and has\ndone so through the present time. Although he expressed reluctance to surrender his\nUnited Kingdom passport, the record does not reflect whether he will renew that\npassport upon its expiration at the end of January 2008.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The United Kingdom is a long-time\nfriend and ally of the U.S. The ties between the two are of unique historical and political\nsignificance. The record does not contain any assertion that the United Kingdom courts\nor solicits its citizens to act in a manner antithetical to the U.S. The burden, however, is\nsquarely on Applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation\nsufficient to overcome the prima facie case raised by the existence of foreign\npreference disqualifying conditions.  Additionally, he has the ultimate burden of\n12\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  By simply admitting the\n13\nallegations against him with no additional explanation, Applicant has failed to meet his\nburden. \nAlthough the scant facts available do not indicate that Applicant poses a\nsignificant threat, any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\n\n Id.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n14\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n15\n7\ninformation.  This resolution is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an\n14\napplicant,  but is an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the\n15\nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInasmuch as Applicant has failed to meet his burden and mitigate security concerns, I\nconclude that he has failed to meet his burden, I conclude it is not clearly consistent\nwith national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\n                                              \n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

D) \n \n \nApplicant obtained a credit card account in the late 1980\u2019s and still has an \naccount with this company. The card was lost in the mail when it was renewed. \n \n2 A chronic obstructive airways disease. \n\n \n \n \n3\n                                                          \nApplicant obtained a new card and had the previous balance transferred to the new \ncard. Applicant believes the account was paid in full as of December 2006. (Tr. 32, Ex. \nA) Applicant has not received any response to his inquiry to the creditor concerning the \nvalidity of the debt. (SOR \u00b6 1. a) (Ex. I) The debt was written off in November 2001, \nwhich is beyond the state statute of limitations.3 \n \n \nApplicant was in the Air Force from 1975 through 1979 obtaining the grade of E4. \nHe has been a volunteer blood donor since 1984. His annual salary is between $52,000 \nand $55,000. (Tr. 63) Following the hearing, Applicant arranged to attend credit \ncounseling with Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). Applicant has a debit \ncard and a department store card with a $300 limit. (Tr. 39, Ex. I) He purchased his \nhome in 1996 and is current on his mortgage payments. (Tr. 35) He owes approximately \n$40,000 on the house the county assesses at $121,000. (Tr. 45) He has $7,000 to \n$8,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 45) His vehicle has been paid for. (Tr. 49)  \n \n \nSince his mother\u2019s death, Applicant has a new prioritized system of paying his \nbills. He is paying his bills on time. (Tr. 66)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n3 See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.004(c) and 16.051 (statute of limitations for contracts); \n16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations for debts); Cont\u2019l Casualty Co. v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. of Tex., 416 \nF.Supp. 2d 497, 505-507 (W.D. Tex. 2006); Facility Ins. Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 357 F.3d \n508, 513-514 (5th Cir. 2004) (discussing statute of limitations for open or revolving accounts).  Debts \nbarred by the Texas statute of limitations are legally uncollectible. However, Applicant\u2019s payments on his \ndebts have reinstated them, ending the statute of limitations defense to collection. See Stine v. Stewart, \n80 S.W.3d 586, 591, 45 Tex. Sup.J. 966 (Tex. 2002).   \n \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of \napplication of the statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they \nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability \nto human affairs.  The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations \nis the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, \nstatutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of \ntime, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred claims.  Moreover, \nlimitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  Statutes of limitations \nare, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The reduction in the magnitude and number of debts that \ncreditors can legally enforce because of the application of the Texas statute of limitations reduces the \npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements, and the degree that a debtor is \u201cfinancially \noverextended,\u201d is also reduced. However, it does not negate the debtor\u2019s past conduct, which failed to \ntake more aggressive actions to resolve the financial jeopardy.  \n \n\n \n \n \n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.4 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $25,000 on five past due obligations. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 \n19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant=s financial problems \nwere contributed to by his sister\u2019s and mother\u2019s illnesses and death, which are events \nthat will not recur. Additionally, part of his income no longer goes for this mother\u2019s \nsupport. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nunder AG & 20(c), has some applicability. It was not until after the hearing Applicant \nsought financial counseling advice through CCCS. But the problem is under control. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant settled and \npaid four of the five debts. \n \nApplicant has inquired of the creditor holding the remaining debt ($1,986) as to \nthe validity of the debt and received no answer. He believes the debt has been paid. It \nwas written off in 2001 and is no longer enforceable through the courts due to the \nstatute of limitation. The debt has not been reduced to a judgment, greatly diminishing \nits enforce ability and its weight as a potential basis for coercion, pressure, or duress. \nThe size of the debt is such that it does not raise security concerns. \n \n4 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n6\n \nApplicant is current on his mortgage, does not have a car payment, has a single \nlow-limit credit card, and no longer helps support his mother. It appears Applicant is in a \nposition to pay this debt, if required. This debt does not raise concerns about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has only one outstanding, which cannot be a source of improper \npressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid\u2014it \nis whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n \n \nI have also considered the record evidence as a whole in light of the whole-\nperson concept. Applicant is 50 years old, has worked for the same company for 28 \nyears, and is sufficiently mature to make thoughtful, prudent decisions about his \nfinancial situation. Facing the not uncommon financial and emotional strains of his \nsister\u2019s and mother\u2019s illnesses and deaths, Applicant let some of his financial obligations \nslide into delinquency. Plainly, he was irresponsible and exercised poor judgment in \ndoing so. Nevertheless, he has presented sufficient evidence to justify a favorable \ndecision for several reasons.  \nFirst, he initiated action and resolved four of the five debts in the SOR. Second, \nhe has contacted the remaining creditor and received no response. The remaining debt \nis no longer enforceable. And third, the record evidence shows a measurable \nimprovement to his financial situation.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has shown that he is \nserious about resolving his past financial problems. Although he has not presented a \nperfect case in mitigation by paying off all debts in the SOR, he has presented sufficient \ninformation to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcern. Likewise, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \n\n \n \n \n7\nclearance decision. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n  \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esquire \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA), on April 30, 2005.\nOn June 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \n \nApplicant provided her answer to the SOR on August 23, 2007. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on October 24, 2007 for a hearing that was originally scheduled for\nNovember 13, 2007. At the beginning of the hearing, I granted Applicant\u2019s motion for\ncontinuance for medical reasons. On December 4, 2007, the case was rescheduled for\nhearing on December 20, 2007. At the hearing, five exhibits (AE 1 through 5) were\nplaced in the record to support the government\u2019s case. Forty-four exhibits (AE A through\nFebruary 14,2008\n\n AE PP (budgetary information) and AE QQ (correspondence relating to debt in 1.c. of the SOR were received\n1\nin the time period allowed for post-hearing submissions. \n In Applicant\u2019s SCA, she listed almost all debts under question 38 (debts over 180 days delinquent in the last\n2\n7 years).\n2\nAE QQ)  were received in the record in support of Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant called one\n1\nwitness and then testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on January 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThere are seven allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant admitted all the alleged delinquent debts, but noted the overdue debts\nidentified in subparagraph 1.c. and 1.f. were the same. As of the date of the SOR (June\n27, 2007) Applicant owes six creditors $49,066.00. \nApplicant is 48 years old. She is divorced and has one son. She became an\nindependent contractor after she was laid off in August 2000. As an independent\ncontractor, she contracts her software training services to private entities or state and\nfederal agencies. Her employment requires living in a customer\u2019s location during the life\nof a contract. When the contract ends, she moves to the next project that could be in a\ndifferent location. Sometimes however, Applicant may have a few months of\nunemployment before beginning her next period of employment. \nDue to a stagnant national economy in August 2000, and before Applicant\nbecame an independent contractor, her employer, a dot. com company, suddenly laid\nher off after promising her an extension of her contract. She moved to another location\nin the state, believing her chances for employment would improve. Upon arriving at the\nnew location, Applicant was incapacitated for a few months after being diagnosed with\nasthma, so she did not look for work. When she started investigating opportunities, she\nfound no work because (1) there was little work to be found in her field, and (2) she had\nno experience in negotiating the terms of her services as an independent contractor.\nBetween August 2000 and May 2001, she paid all her credit cards with her savings.\nWhen she stopped paying her credit cards in May 2001, the listed debts fell delinquent\nas late fees and interest quickly climbed to levels she could not pay. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance questionnaire (SCA) (GE 1),  dated April 30, 2005,\n2\nreflects that after she resumed employment in November 2001, she worked on\ncontracts for four employers, and then was unemployed from June to December 2003.\nShe knows she should have paid off the debt after she resumed work, \u201cbut [I] was very\nbusy trying to make up for the time I had been unemployed by just working as much as I\ncould.\u201d (Tr. 69)\n\n Applicant adopted the ROI with minor changes.\n3\n3\nApplicant is sure she will not fall into the same situation as she did in 2000. She\ntestified, \u201cBecause I have established savings (Tr. 71; AE MM), I\u2019ve established a\nretirement account. I am working consistently and I am paying my - - my credit card bills\nin full every month so there is no debt.\u201d (Tr. 70) \nOn May 26, 2007, Applicant provided answers to interrogatories. Attached to her\nanswers is a report of interview (ROI) (October 13, 2006) conducted by an investigator\nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Applicant.  Applicant quoted her\n3\nearnings at about $94,000.00 a year, with a monthly remainder of more than $4,600.00\na month for savings. \nApplicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories also contain an attached statement from\nher regarding the interview, Applicant\u2019s budget, and a list of her creditors. \nIn the attached statement (GE 2), Applicant acknowledged the October 13, 2006,\ninterview was substantially accurate, though she pointed out some changes. She\nexplained in the attached statement she had not been able to resolve any of the debts\nbecause of her temporary work assignment since November 2006 that was not\nsupposed to end until July 2007. Applicant requested more time to launch her plan to\naddress the creditors. She stated, \u201cIt is still my intent to make arrangements to settle\nwith my [creditors] but it may take time to find the current owners of the debts, negotiate\na \nsettlement, \nand \nmake \npayment \narrangements.\u201d \n(GE \n2, \nstatement\nsupplementing/correcting the October 2006 interview) Behind her attached statement is\na budget showing yearly income, monthly taxes, and assets. She supplemented her\nbudget in GE 2 with a budget for November and December 2007. (AE PP)\nAs Applicant indicated in her May 2007 answers to interrogatories, and her\nAugust 2007 answer to the SOR, she intends to repay her debts. Combined with the\nemployment issues, the delay in repaying her debts was partially due to an inability to\nfind the owners of the accounts. \nIn May or June 2007, Applicant\u2019s cousin, a paralegal for about 20 years, agreed\nto assist Applicant locate the account owners and resolve the delinquent accounts.\nThough she had no experience, Applicant\u2019s cousin was positive she could locate the\nowners of the overdue accounts and negotiate settlements. Applicant also hired a public\naccountant to assist in the negotiations with the creditors while advising her in the\nbusiness aspects of her extant consulting venture. \nLocating the actual owners was difficult as most of the accounts had been sold\nseveral times. The cousin located and communicated with four of the six listed creditors.\nDuring her investigation, she discovered that the accounts described in subparagraphs\n1.c. and 1.f. were the same account. All listed debts became delinquent at various times\nin 2001, when Applicant was unemployed. \n\n4\n\u0090 The account ($3,351.00) with creditor 1.a. was paid in full on September 26,\n2007. (AE H, AE I) Though the debt was charged off by the original creditor, it had not\nbeen sold to a collection agency. The creditor accepted the written off amount in full\nsatisfaction of the debt. (Tr. 99) \n\u0090 The account ($8,843.00) belonging to creditor 1.c. was settled on September\n21, 2007 for $3,700.00. (GE KK) In a letter by the collection agency to Applicant on\nSeptember 7, 2007 (GE QQ) laying out terms of the settlement, the collection agency\nidentifies creditor 1.f. as the original creditor of the account. \n\u0090 The account ($3,631.50) belonging to creditor 1.e. was settled for $1,800.00\non September 21, 2007. (AE G, AE LL) \n\u0090 The oil company credit union account (1.g.) totaling $11,307.49, was settled\nfor $2,929.00 on October 23, 2007. (AE M, Q, R)\n-\n\u0090 Applicant tried several times through letters to establish contact with the\ncreditor in 1.b. and the collection agency in 1.d. (AE T, V, W, and NN) In her letters, she\nindicated that she obtained the creditor\u2019s name from her credit bureau report. She\nrequested that she be contacted in writing by the creditor about resolving the delinquent\ndebt. As of the date of hearing, she had received no response from either the creditor in\n1.b. or the collection agency in 1.d. \nApplicant\u2019s cousin knows that Applicant\u2019s current financial problems eventuated\nfrom unemployment in 2000 and 2001. To avoid having those same problems, Applicant\nhas been regularly saving large amounts of money, and paying her bills in advance. The\ncousin has seen Applicant\u2019s monthly budget. \nApplicant is sticking to her budget. She has reestablished her credit as evidenced\nby her credit cards that she pays every month in full to avoid carrying balances. (Tr. 86)\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing plan is to satisfy the remaining creditors even though the debts may\nno longer be legally enforceable. (Tr. 88)\nOn November 12, 2007, Applicant attended a live one-hour, financial counseling\ncourse, and received a certificate of completion. (AE AA) The instructor did not believe\nadditional counseling was necessary. (Tr. 126)\nApplicant is viewed at work and in non-work situations as honest and trustworthy.\nHer social friend of two years thinks she is a caring individual. Applicant\u2019s education\nloan that she opened in June 1997 shows a regular payment history from December\n2003 to the present. \n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-\nthe-clock responsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nInability to pay bills on time places the individual debtor at risk of committing\nillegal acts to generate funds. \n\n6\nAnalysis\nApplicant\u2019s financial indebtedness falls within the scope of FC disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC 19.c. (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations). As of the date of the SOR, Applicant owed\n$49,066.00 to six creditors. For approximately six years, she did nothing to address the\ndebts. \nBecause the listed debts converted to a delinquent status within a relatively small\nperiod of time six years ago, FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) receives some consideration. All credit reports (GE 3, 4, and 5) show\nthe debts became past due in 2001, without more recent evidence of delinquent\nindebtedness. \nHaving been informed of a contract extension in 2000, Applicant did not foresee\na sudden layoff followed by a 14-month period of unemployment from August 2000 to\nNovember 2001. Fortunately, she exercised good judgment by continuing to pay the\ncredit cards until May 2001, when she exhausted her savings account.  \nApplicant\u2019s medical problems, a lack of experience in negotiating her\nindependent contractor services in 2000 and 2001, and a poor economy, fetches less\nmitigation with the passage of time, her fairly steady employment, except for a six-\nmonth period in 2003, and Applicant\u2019s aggressive saving practices. With the amount of\nmoney Applicant was saving in October 2006, she could have easily paid off or settled\ntwo of the smaller debts listed in the SOR. The fact that it was difficult to locate the\nowners of the accounts is not mitigating. As her monthly remainder indicates, Applicant\ncould have hired professional support much earlier to assist her locate and resolve her\nfinancial delinquencies. \nApplicant\u2019s completion of the financial counseling course is entitled to limited\nconsideration FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol), even though the course was completed shortly before the hearing, and lasted\nonly an hour. The more probative evidence is Applicant\u2019s budget that has been in\nexistence since May 2007. (GE 2) Even though there are still two large debts\noutstanding that must be addressed, the presence of a budget provides a concrete\nindicator that Applicant is committed to regaining firm control over her finances. \nApplicant repayment of $11,700.00 to fully pay one creditor and settle three of six\ncreditors are entitled to substantial weight under FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) With the help of\nher cousin and her accountant, Applicant executed her plan to address her debts. Even\nthough receipt of the SOR played a significant part in Applicant\u2019s success in settling with\nfour of six creditors, Applicant is to be commended for paying the debts from her own\n\n7\nfunds rather than creating new debt by taking out a loan. I find for Applicant under the\nfinancial considerations guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nAs set forth on page 18 of Enclosure 2 of Directive 5220.6, the decision to grant\nor deny a security clearance depends on a commonsense assessment of the FC\nguideline, and then evaluating that guideline in the context of the general factors of the\nwhole person. Accumulating more than $49,000.00 in debt to six creditors since 2001\ndemonstrates \nserious \nfinancial \nproblems. \nHowever, \na \n14-month \nperiod \nof\nunemployment was a circumstance that a reasonable 41-year-old person in Applicant\u2019s\nposition could not have anticipated, especially after she had been told she could expect\na contract extension. Though she should have tackled the debts much sooner than she\ndid, the 14-month period of unemployment made her increasingly apprehensive about\nanother long period of unemployment. \nApplicant has made several behavior changes in her financial practices that\npersuade me to find for her under the FC guideline. First, she has never attempted to\nhide or shy away from the past due debt, although she has learned that the remaining\ndebts may no longer be legally enforceable. Second, in May or June 2007, Applicant\ndevised and executed a plan that harvested the pay off or settlement of four out of six\ncreditors in September 2007. Third, in May 2007, she changed her financial practices by\ninstalling a budget to aid in the management of her financial affairs. The budget is\nfacilitating payment of her current creditors in advance of when the actual debts are\ndue. Fourth, she hired an accountant to oversee her business matters. Finally, I am\nconfident Applicant will resolve the remaining two debts as she had with the other four.\nHaving considered the record as a whole, the FC guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) February 14, 2006.  On September 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nfor financial considerations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct under Guidelines F, \nE, and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 2, 2007. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 10, 2007.  He admitted five \nand denied five of the allegations under Guideline F and denied the allegations under \nGuidelines E and J.  He provided an explanation for his admissions and denials, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department counsel was prepared \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nto proceed on January 31, 2008, and the case was assigned to another administrative \njudge on February 1, 2008, and reassigned to me on February 21, 2008.  DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on March 18, 2008, for a hearing on April 29, 2008.  I convened the \nhearing as scheduled.  The government offered five exhibits, marked government \nexhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received without objection.  Applicant \nsubmitted three documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A-C, which were \nreceived without objection.  Applicant and one Applicant witness testified on his behalf.  \nThe record was left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted three documents, marked App. Ex. D-F.  The documents were admitted into \nthe record without objection (Gov. Ex 6).  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on May 14, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 51 years old and has worked for over 25 years as a pipefitter in a \nNavy shipyard.  He has held a security clearance for over 22 years.  In the past year, he \nhas been working more than 25 hours per week overtime.  Applicant and his wife have \nbeen married for over 30 years.  She is a certified nursing assistant at a local hospital.  \nThey have two children, a 27-year-old daughter and a 24-year-old son, who had lived \non their own but are now back in the house with Applicant and his wife.  Their daughter \nhas two children, ages eight and ten, living with them.  Applicant and his wife had no \nfinancial issues until their children created problems for the couple when they went on \ntheir own (Tr. 56-61; Gov. Ex 1, Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing \n(e-QIP), dated February 14, 2006).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife handles the family finances and pays their bills.  Applicant and \nhis wife have a combined monthly income of $5,800, and combined monthly expenses \nof $3,000.  They have approximately $2,800 in discretionary funds each month (Tr. 58-\n60).  They have discussed their financial issues with friends and co-worker who are \nknowledge about business affairs but they have not received formal financial counseling \n(Tr. 16-23). \n \nCredit reports and the SOR list ten delinquent debts: a collection for $7,217 \n(SOR 1.a); a delinquent phone bill for collection for $2,749 (SOR 1.b); a medical debt in \ncollection for $5,657 (SOR 1.c); a judgment for $40,672 (SOR 1.d); a charged off \naccount for $3,033 (SOR 1.e); four delinquent medical accounts to the same hospital for \n$49.15, $146.36, $139.47, and $78.41 (SOR 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j); and a television \nservice collection account for $264 (SOR 1.h) (Gov. Ex. 2, credit report, dated March \n17, 2006; Gov. Ex. 3, credit report, dated March 8, 2007; Gov. Ex. 4, Interrogatory, \ndated April 18, 2007; and Gov. Ex. 5, credit report, dated April 22, 2008).  Applicant \nadmitted the allegations in SOR 1.a-1.e but denied the remaining five allegations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife co-signed for a car loan for a used car for their daughter.  The \ndaughter defaulted on the loan, so Applicant\u2019s wife as co-signer is responsible, which \nmakes Applicant also responsible for the debt.  Applicant and his wife recognize their \n\n \n3 \n \n \nresponsibility on the debt and are working to establish a payment plan (Tr. 33-35, 47-49, \n62-64).  \n \nThe delinquent cell phone collection account (SOR 1.b) also belongs to \nApplicant\u2019s daughter.  His wife co-signed for the phone plan and both Applicant and his \nwife are responsible for the debt that their daughter did not pay.  There are no payments \nbeing made on this debt (Tr. 30-33; 48-49). \n \nThe medical collection account listed in SOR allegation 1.c for $5,657 is for \nApplicant\u2019s son\u2019s medical treatment from injuries received in an automobile accident.  \nThe son was treated at the hospital where Applicant\u2019s wife works.  Since the son was \nunable to sign the discharge documents because of his injuries, Applicant\u2019s wife signed \nthe papers making her responsible for the debt.  Their son had no health insurance.  \nThe debt is being paid by payroll deduction from Applicant\u2019s wife (Tr. 30-33; App. Ex. B, \npayroll records, April 29, 2008).  \n \nSOR allegations 1.d, is for a mobile home that Applicant\u2019s wife co-signed for their \ndaughter.  Their daughter ceased to make payments, so the mobile home was \nrepossessed and sold.  Applicant is waiting to receive information from the creditor \nconcerning the amount owed after the repossession so a payment plan can be \nestablished (Tr. 25-30). \n \nSOR allegation 1.d is a debt of $3,033 for a credit card used by Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter and co-signed by his wife.  Applicant and his wife have settled the account \nwith the creditor for $2,000, and are making payment according to the settlement plan \n(Tr. 24-25; App. Ex D, Letters, dated May 13, 2008). \n \nSOR allegations 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i are hospital bills for treatment of Applicant\u2019s \nwife.  The debts have been paid by payroll deduction since Applicant\u2019s wife is an \nemployee of the hospital (Tr. 35-39; App. Ex. B, Payroll records, dated April 29, 2008). \n \nSOR allegation 1.h is for satellite television service for $264 incurred by their \ndaughter.  Applicant\u2019s wife paid this debt in full (Tr. 36-38; App. Ex. E, Bank statement, \ndated October 29, 2007).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s latest credit report show most of his debts are paid as agreed, except \nfor the credit card in SOR allegation 1.e discussed above, the car loan in SOR \nallegation 1.a, the mobile home repossession in SOR allegation 1.d, and a collection \naccount for $2,417 (App. Ex A, credit report, dated March 17, 2008).  Applicant \npresented documentation that there was an agreement to settle the account by paying \n$307 monthly.  The account settlement was paid in full for $6,111.73 (App. Ex. C, \nletters, dated February 15, 2007; App. Ex. F, Paid judgment, dated November 21, \n2007). \n \nIn response to questions on his security clearance application concerning his \nfinances, Applicant listed the mobile home repossession debt as having been in the last \n\n \n4 \n \n \nseven years more than 180 days past due.  He also listed a wage garnishment as well \nas the mobile home repossession in response to questions pertaining to garnishments \nand repossessions.  He did not list any debts as currently more than 90 days past due.  \nApplicant credibly testified that he did not fully read the question or think about all of the \ndebts caused by his children when he completed the security clearance application.  He \ndid not intend to deceive when completing the form but made a mistake in not reading \nthe question carefully or remembering all of his debts.  He answered the questions as \nbest he could (Tr. 77-82). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts he admitted and that are listed in credit reports \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations).  Even though most of the delinquent debts were caused \nby Applicant\u2019s children but attributed to him because his wife had co-signed the \ndocuments for their children, Applicant is responsible for the debts. \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) has some application.  While six of the debts have \nbeen paid, four are still being discussed with the creditors, so these debts are current.  \nWhile the debts were mainly caused by the actions of Applicant\u2019s children, there are a \nvariety of debts from medical bills, a repossession, an automobile loan, and a cell phone \nbill.  Applicant has delinquent debt because his wife co-signed for their children.  The \nchildren are now living with Applicant and his wife and Applicant knows not to sign again \nfor his children.  Co-signing for their children is unlikely to recur.  I gave consideration to \nthese unusual circumstances leading to some of the delinquent debts.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \n\n \n6 \n \n \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.  Applicant and his wife managed \ntheir personal finances appropriately.  Their financial problems were caused by the \nirresponsible actions of their children and their desire to help the children by co-signing \nfor certain loans and arrangements.  Applicant acknowledges his legal responsibilities \nas a co-signer and is making payments or arrangements to pay the debts.  He acted \nreasonably under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good effort to pay them.  Applicant paid five of the delinquent debts.  His \nwife is paying a medical debt for their son by payroll deduction.  They reached an \nagreement with the creditor and are paying on that loan.  They are working with other \ncreditors to establish payment plans on the remaining debts.  Applicant and his wife \nmanaged their own finances appropriately.  Their troubles were caused by their \nchildren, not by them.  Applicant acted responsibly towards his debts, and established \nhis good-faith efforts to resolve his debts.  He mitigated security concerns for his \nfinancial situation \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers to a \nquestion on his security clearance application concerning his past due debts raises a \nsecurity concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \n(the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  Applicant listed a wage garnishment \nand repossession in the appropriate sections of the form.  He listed only one debt that \nwas over 180 days past due, and none that were currently over 90 days past due.  \nApplicant credibly testified that when he completed his security clearance application, \nhe listed the debt that he knew were security concerns.  He was not aware of all debts \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncaused by his children\u2019s actions.  He acknowledged that he did not read the questions \ncarefully and made a mistake not including all of the debts on the application.  While \nthere is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material \nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a \nsecurity clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully.  Since Applicant listed the financial concerns he was aware of, \nand he was not reasonably sure of other delinquent debts, the available information \nshows his failure to list all delinquent debts was not knowing and willful.  Applicant \nestablished he did not deliberately provide false information on the security clearance \napplication with intent to deceive.  I find for Appellant as to Personal Conduct.  Since \nthere is no intention to deceive, there is no violation of federal law and no criminal \nconduct.  I also find for Applicant as to criminal conduct. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant has worked \nfor over 25 years in a Navy shipyard and successfully held a security clearance for 22 \nyears.  I considered that Applicant and his wife manage their personal finances \nappropriately and meet their personal financial obligations.  Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were created by his children and the desire to help them.  Applicant \nacknowledges his legal obligation to pay the outstanding debts created by his children.  \nApplicant lives within his means, satisfied his personal debt, and meets his personal \nfinancial obligations. His actions do no indicate poor self control, lack of judgment or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  He is not financially overextended.  \nApplicant\u2019s finances do not create a security concern.  He did not provide incomplete \ninformation on his security clearance application with the intent to deceive.  He provided \nthe information he knew which should alert security investigators to any financial issues.  \nHis action did not amount to a personal or criminal conduct security concern.  Overall, \non balance the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations, \npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n__________\nDecision\n__________\nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence). Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn October 3, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF\n86). On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended,\nFebruary 29, 2008\n\nOn Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing\n1\napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the\nDirective and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation),\ndated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case.\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Nov. 7, 2007; and\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt on Nov. 14, 2007, which DOHA received on Nov. 15, 2007. The DOHA\ntransmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information.\n2\nmodified and revised.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign\n1\nInfluence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nOn September 11, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete\ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated November 7, 2007, was provided to\nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant did not submit any information within\n2\nthe 30-day time period after receiving a copy of the FORM. The case was assigned to\nme on January 28, 2008.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request in his FORM that I take\nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to Hong Kong. Department Counsel also\nprovided supporting documents to show the basis for the facts in his FORM, which are\ncontained in Exs. I through IX. Inasmuch as Applicant did not respond to Department\nCounsel\u2019s FORM, any objection Applicant may have had to my considering these\ndocuments is considered waived. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12,\n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization\nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative\nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from\ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co.\n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took administrative notice\nof various facts derived from Department Counsel\u2019s FORM and Exs. I through IX as\nindicated under subheading \u201cHong Kong\u201d of this decision.\n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a to 1.d in his response to the SOR. However, he denied that he had \u201cdivided\nloyalties\u201d under \u00b6 1. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of\nfact.  \nApplicant is a 36-year-old engineer, who has been employed by his defense\ncontractor employer since May 2005. Government Exhibit (GE) 4. He is a U.S.-born\ncitizen and does not hold dual citizenship and/or a foreign passport. GE 5. He seeks a\nsecurity clearance in conjunction with his employment.\nApplicant was awarded a Master of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering in\nMay 1999. Applicant married his wife in August 2005. She was born in Hong Kong in\n1973 and is a citizen of Hong Kong. SOR \u00b6 1.a. The U.S. Department of Homeland\nSecurity granted her permanent residence status (green card) in June 2006. Applicant\ndoes not list any children in his October 2006 security clearance application. In addition\nto Applicant\u2019s wife, Applicant\u2019s immediate family members consist of his parents, and\nthree adult siblings. His parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, and his siblings are U.S.-\nborn citizens. His parents and siblings reside in the U.S. GE 4. \nApplicant\u2019s wife came to the U.S. in \u201c1999/2000\u201d on a student visa and attended\ncollege from \u201c1999/2000 to 2000/2001.\u201d GE 5. After attending college, she worked for a\nnon-profit organization after being granted a work visa. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born in Hong Kong in 1947 and is a citizen and\nresident of Hong Kong. She is employed in a senior position for a university in Hong\nKong. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law was born n China in 1943 and is a citizen and resident of\nHong Kong. He is a retired politician, who lost his last election in 2004. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and\n1.c. He held office under British rule and under the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\nuntil he was defeated in 2004. Applicant\u2019s spouse has monthly telephone contact with\nher parents in Hong Kong. Applicant\u2019s telephone contact with his in-laws averages one-\nto-two times a year around holidays. His e-mail contact with his in-laws averages two-\nto-three times a year also around holidays. GE 5.\nApplicant and his wife traveled to Hong Kong from August 2004 to September\n2004. This visit occurred before their marriage for the purpose of visiting Applicant\u2019s\nwife\u2019s parents. Applicant and his wife traveled to Hong Kong for a second time in\nDecember 2005 to visit Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents. SOR \u00b6 1. d.\nApplicant denied the notion that he had any divided loyalties between the U.S.\nand Hong Kong. He stated he witnessed the 9/11 disaster from his office in New York\n\nThe contents of the Hong Kong section are taken in whole or in part from Department Counsel\u2019s\n3\nFORM and its attachments.\n4\nCity, which is where he worked at the time. This tragedy deeply affected him and he\nadded that he would not do anything to endanger American lives.\nHong Kong3\nHong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC) on July 1, 1997. Hong Kong has a population of 6.9 million and 95% of\nHong Kong\u2019s population is of Chinese descent. China has given Hong Kong a high\ndegree of autonomy, except the PRC has retained responsibility for defense and foreign\npolicy. Recently, China has taken a more active oversight role of Hong Kong\u2019s control of\npolitical developments.\nUnder Chinese law, PRC citizenship is automatic for persons of Chinese\ndescent, who were born in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government generally respects\nthe human rights of its citizens, however, reported human rights problems include some\npolitical restrictions on the legislature\u2019s power, media self-censorship, violence and\ndiscrimination against women, and restrictions on workers\u2019 rights to collectively bargain.\nChina has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human\nrights record, suppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention,\nforced confessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment.\nChina is a nuclear power with a large Army. China is geographically vast, and\nhas a population of over one billion people. It has significant resources, and an\neconomy that in recent years has expanded about 10% per year. China aggressively\ncompetes with the United States in many areas. PRC\u2019s competitive relationship with the\nUnited States exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s Hong Kong connections.  \nChina actively collects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information\nabout the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a\nglobal superpower; (2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim\nand Asia; (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology that China desires\nfor economic growth; and (4) China considers the large number of Americans of\nChinese ancestry as intelligence targets. China\u2019s active intelligence gathering programs\nfocus on sensitive and protected U.S. technologies. China maintains intelligence\noperations in Hong Kong utilizing PRC nationals with Hong Kong connections.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind\n4\nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than\nthe weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does\nnot prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a\npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\n5\nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the\nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4\ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant]\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n6\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3.\nAnalysis\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d\nstating:\n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or\nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\n\n7\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not,\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in\na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is\nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the\ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb.\n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent\ncontact with his in-laws. These close relationships with these relatives create a potential\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a\nclose examination of all circumstances.\nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying\nconditions as a result of Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. The\nGovernment established Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Hong Kong and resident of\nthe U.S.; that his in-laws are citizens and residents of Hong Kong; that his father-in-law\nis a retired politician in Hong Kong, who ran for office in 2004; and that Applicant\ntraveled to Hong Kong in 2004 and 2005. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce\nevidence and prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of\ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.\nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially\napplicable to these disqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nApplying common sense and life experience, there is a rebuttable presumption\nthat a person has ties of affection for, and/or obligation to, the immediate family\nmembers of the person\u2019s spouse. ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26,\n2006); ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has\ndemonstrated the indicia of ties of affection for/and or obligation to his in-laws by\n\n8\nfrequent telephone and e-mail contact as well as accompanying his wife to Hong Kong\nto visit his in-laws in 2004 and 2005. \nThe record is void of details regarding the status of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law as a\nretired politician, including the type of position he held, level of past responsibility, length\nof service, and circumstances surrounding his electoral defeat in 2004. Also identified in\nthe record is what influence, if any, the Chinese Government could exert on Applicant\u2019s\nmother-in-law as a result of her employment in a senior position for a major university in\nHong Kong. As a result of the positions held by Applicant\u2019s in-laws, the burden shifted to\nApplicant to show his in-laws and their positions do not create security risks. \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all\nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd.\nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As\nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cHong Kong,\u201d Hong Kong is a part of the PRC, which\nis ruled by a communist government that actively engages in intelligence gathering\nagainst the U.S. The PRC also has a poor human rights record.\nApplicant denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the U.S. and any foreign\ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S. was not challenged in this\nproceeding. The issue is rather a positional one. \n[Guideline B] hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is\nforced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States,\nbut rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a\nposition where he is forced to make such a choice. ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005).\nOn balance, Applicant has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood\nthat [his relationship with his in-laws] could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d The nature of the PRC\u2019s government and its ongoing intelligence gathering\nactivities against the U.S. places Applicant in just this position, given his family\u2019s\ncontinued presence and connection with Hong Kong and the PRC. Accordingly,\nMitigating Conditions 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as\ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to\nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept,\nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life\nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and\n\n ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App.\n6\nBd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, 468\nF.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each\nevent is viewed in isolation).\n See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth\n7\nAPF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App.\nBd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006)\n(remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for exploitation\u201d), but see\nISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that eighth APF is exclusive\ncircumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases).\n9\ncircumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are\n6\nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve\nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the\neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.  In addition to the\n7\neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense\ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.   \n The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the\nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.;\nand many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7\n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\nThere is some mitigating evidence that weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance. Applicant is a U.S.-born citizen and has lived in the U.S. his entire\nlife except for brief periods of foreign travel. His parents are naturalized U.S. citizens\nand his three adult siblings are U.S.-born citizens. All of his immediate family members\nlive in the U.S. His ties to the United States are stronger than his ties to his wife\u2019s family\nmembers in Hong Kong. There is no evidence Applicant has ever taken any action\nwhich could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United\nStates very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a defense contractor for almost\nthree years. The FORM contains no derogatory record evidence about the Applicant.\n I have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal\nconnections to Hong Kong.  Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole\nperson analysis.  First, the PRC is a nuclear power and PRC\u2019s government is a rival of\nthe United States. China is an authoritarian, Communist state. More importantly for\nsecurity purposes, PRC actively seeks classified and industrial/economic information.\nThe PRC may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s in-laws who live in Hong Kong to obtain such\ninformation. Second, he had significant connections to Hong Kong vis-\u00e0-vis his wife\u2019s\nparents. Although his wife immigrated to the United States in \u201c1999/2000,\u201d she was born\nin Hong Kong, and spent her formative years there. Her parents live and reside in Hong\nKong and held or hold visible positions in Hong Kong. Applicant and his wife have\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006). \n8\n10\nvisited Applicant\u2019s in-laws in Hong Kong two times recently, i.e. 2004 and 2005.\nApplicant did not rule out visiting Hong Kong in the future. Applicant\u2019s wife, and to a\nlesser extent Applicant, maintain frequent contact with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents in\nHong Kong by telephone and e-mail. These contacts are manifestations of strong\naffection and regard Applicant and/or his wife have for family members in Hong Kong.  \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it\nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by\ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir.\nth\n1990).  This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern\nunder the facts presented that the Hong Kong Government or its agents might exploit or\nattempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s family members in such a way that this U.S. citizen would\nhave to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family members.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence. This is a close case, but ultimately the\nevidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and\n8\nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant\nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude\nhe is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\n____________________________\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 37-year-old information security engineer, working for a government contractor. He was born, raised, and educated in Nigeria (Tr. 28, GE 1). In 1994, at age 24, he completed a Nigerian \u201chigher national diploma,\u201d which is the equivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 31). From 1994 to 1997, he worked for two Nigerian private companies as a quality surveyor estimating building construction costs (Tr. 33). In 1997, Applicant won a lottery for a U.S. visa and immigrated to the United States (Tr. 29). After his arrival, he enlisted and served in the U.S. Army from August 1998 to March 1999. He was medically discharged due to health problems. His service was characterized as honorable.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel, \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003, and received his U.S. \npassport shortly thereafter. His renewal, use, and current possession of a valid Nigerian \npassport pose an unacceptable security concern. He mitigated the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns arising from his family in Nigeria, but failed to mitigate the foreign \npreference security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on June 2, 2005. \nOn October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMarch 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 15 and 31, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on December \n19, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 24, 2007, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on January 16, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3, which were received without objection. GE 3 was not admitted, but \nconsidered for administrative notice purposes only.2 Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted one exhibit, marked AE 1. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on January 30, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, and 2.b with \nexplanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old information security engineer, working for a \ngovernment contractor. He was born, raised, and educated in Nigeria (Tr. 28, GE 1). In \n1994, at age 24, he completed a Nigerian \u201chigher national diploma,\u201d which is the \nequivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 31). From 1994 to 1997, he worked for two \nNigerian private companies as a quality surveyor estimating building construction costs \n(Tr. 33).  \n \nIn 1997, Applicant won a lottery for a U.S. visa and immigrated to the United \nStates (Tr. 29). After his arrival, he enlisted and served in the U.S. Army from August \n1998 to March 1999. He was medically discharged due to health problems. His service \nwas characterized as honorable. Applicant then worked for several U.S. companies as a \nphysical security officer, and at a group home where he cared for mentally retarded \npeople (Tr. 31). From 1998 to 2000, he attended college while working full time \u201cto \nprepare himself to fit in the U.S. environment and accomplish his dream.\u201d From 2002 to \n2003, he earned a master\u2019s degree in network security, which was awarded in August \n2004 (Tr. 42). Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2003, and \nreceived his U.S. passport the following month (GE 1). \n \nSince his release from the Army in 1999, Applicant worked for several \ninformation technology and computer business related companies. In May 2005, he \nstarted working for his current employer, a federal contractor, as an information security \nengineer. He ensures clients\u2019 compliance with security requirements, and conducts \nvulnerability assessments, certifications, and accreditations of clients\u2019 information \ntechnology systems (Tr. 44). \n \n \n2  Department Counsel\u2019s December 14, 2007 motion asked that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts concerning the government of Nigeria. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were considered and included in the record as GE 3 for Identification. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant married his Nigerian wife in 1996, before he immigrated to the United \nStates. While in Nigeria, she worked as a secretary for a privately owned company. She \nimmigrated to the United States in April 2001, and is currently employed as a nurse (Tr. \n36-37). They have a three-and-one-half-year-old son born in the United States. She has \napplied for U.S. citizenship and is waiting to be called for the swearing in ceremony to \ncomplete her naturalization process.  \n \nApplicant and his wife own their residence and three other investment properties \nin the United States, with an equity value of around $200,000. Additionally, he has a \n401(k) investment plan. Applicant and his wife have no financial assets, and own no \nproperty or investments in Nigeria (Tr. 39, 69). \n \nApplicant claimed that neither he nor his wife ever served in the Nigerian military \nforces, and that they never worked for the Nigerian government or for any government \naffiliated company (Tr. 38). Since leaving Nigeria, he has had no contact with any \nfriends and coworkers in Nigeria, except those he visited with during his trips back to \nNigeria.  \n \nIn February 2004, December 2004, and in November 2007 (Tr. 65), Applicant \ntraveled to Nigeria for pleasure, and stayed for approximately two weeks during each \ntrip. He renewed his Nigerian passport during his February 2004 trip to Nigeria at the \ninstance of Nigerian border officials. Since then, he has used both passports, his \nNigerian passport and his U.S. passport to enter and exit Nigeria (Tr. 63-65). As of the \nday of his hearing, Applicant was in possession of a valid Nigerian passport, which will \nnot expire until February 2009.  \n \nApplicant stayed with his older brother whenever he travelled to Nigeria. His \nmother, siblings, other relatives, and friends came to visit him at his brother\u2019s home \nwhile he was in Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s mother, his 13 siblings, his wife\u2019s three siblings and \nher mother, as well as all of their extended families are citizens and residents of Nigeria. \nApplicant claimed that none of his or his wife\u2019s family members are or have been \nmembers of the Nigerian military forces, or employed by the Nigerian government (Tr. \n55-58).  \n \nWhile in the United States, he contacts his mother and his older brother \napproximately once a month to ask about his mother\u2019s and siblings\u2019 health (GE 2). He \ncontacts his other siblings through his older brother (Tr. 59). Applicant has a close \nrelationship with his mother and provides support for her occasionally (Tr. 51). She \ncame twice to visit him in the United States after Applicant\u2019s son was born. He believes \nall of his siblings and wife\u2019s family support the general policies and interests of the \nUnited States. \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator \nconcerning possible foreign preference issues (GE 2). At that time, he became aware of \npossible security concerns arising out of his dual citizenship and possession of a \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nNigerian passport. In his December 2005 statement, his answers to the SOR, and \nnumerous times during his hearing, Applicant offered to surrender his Nigerian passport \nand to renounce his Nigerian citizenship. Applicant explained he was not under any \nobligation to Nigeria, and claimed the only reason he had not surrendered his passport \nor renounced his Nigerian citizenship was because no one had explained to him the \nprocess to do so.  \n \nHe claimed he asked several times to both personnel at the Nigerian embassy in \nNigeria and in the Nigerian embassy in the United States for information on how to \nsurrender his passport and renounce his Nigerian citizenship and received no help. He \nalso claimed he asked his employers\u2019 facility security officers and DOHA personnel for \nthe same information, and that he performed Internet searches looking for such \ninformation to no avail (Tr. 68-69; 76-89). Other than his testimony, he presented no \nevidence of efforts he has taken to surrender his passport or renounce his Nigerian \ncitizenship. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Nigeria is a federal republic \ncomposed of 36 states and a capital territory. The government\u2019s human rights record is \npoor, and government officials at all levels commit serious human rights abuses. Areas \nof the country are marked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed conflict between \nreligious, political, and ethnic factions. The lack of law and order in the country poses \nconsiderable risks to travelers. \n \nThe Nigerian government provides strong diplomatic support to U.S. government \ncounter-terrorism efforts. It has condemned terrorist attacks against the United States \nand supported military actions against the Taliban and Al-Qaida. It also has played a \nleading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus among states in their region. The \nUnited States provides the people of Nigeria with substantial financial assistance in \nareas such as public health, education, and in their efforts of developing effective \ninstitutions of democratic governance. Nigeria is an important trading partner of the \nUnited States. There is no evidence of economic competition with the United States, or \nthat Nigeria has or ever had an intelligence gathering program targeting U.S. economic, \nindustrial, or military critical technologies.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C the government\u2019s concern is \u201cwhen an individual acts in such \na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he \nor she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003 and was issued a U.S. \npassport shortly thereafter. He renewed his Nigerian passport in February 2004, \napparently at the instance of Nigerian border officials. He used both his Nigerian \npassport and U.S. passport to travel to Nigeria twice in 2004 and once in 2007 because \nof convenience, i.e., he did not have to go through the process of requesting a visa. At \nhis hearing, he was in possession of a current Nigerian passport that does not expire \nuntil 2009. \n \nForeign preference disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10 provides: \u201c(a) exercise of any \nright, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport,\u201d applies.  \n \nAfter considering all the foreign preference mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11, I \nfind that only AG \u00b6 11(b): \u201cThe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship,\u201d applies. Applicant renewed and used his foreign passport after becoming a \nU.S. citizen, and receiving his U.S. passport. As of the day of his hearing, he was still in \npossession of his valid foreign passport. He presented no evidence to show that his use \nof the foreign passport was approved by a cognizant security authority. \n \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s expressed willingness to renounce his dual \ncitizenship and to surrender his passport, two years after he was confronted with the \nsecurity concerns raised by his possession of a valid passport and his exercise of dual \ncitizenship he was still in possession of a valid Nigerian passport. Applicant\u2019s claims, \ni.e., that he asked Nigerian embassy officials, a government investigator, his employer\u2019s \nfacility security officers, DOHA personnel, and that he researched the Internet looking \nfor information about to how to renounce his foreign citizenship and to surrender his \npassport, are not credible.  \n \nApplicant was confronted about his possession and use of a foreign passport at \nleast three times, i.e., by a government investigator (GE 2), through the DOHA \ninterrogatories, and by the SOR allegations. Applicant is 37 years old, and holds a \nmaster\u2019s degree in computer management and information systems with a \nconcentration on networks security. He was provided a copy of the Directive outlining \nthe government\u2019s security concerns. With a little diligence, Applicant would have been \nable to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns raised by his use and possession of \na current foreign passport. He did not provide copies of any correspondence sent to \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nsecurity officials, DOHA, or the Nigerian government offering to relinquish his clearance. \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances presented by Applicant\u2019s case, he has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline C.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is:  \n \n \n\u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d AG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5 Applicant has frequent contacts (at least once a \nmonth) and a close relationship of affection and/or obligation with his mother and \nsiblings, who are residents and citizens of Nigeria. These contacts create a risk of \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that \nNigerian agents or criminals may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about the \nUnited States. His connection to his family members also create a potential conflict of \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \ninterest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about \nhis desire to help them by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that mitigating condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. Applicant has strong \nfeelings of affection and a strong sense of obligation to his siblings. The closeness of \nthe relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s telephone contacts with his siblings, the \nfinancial support provided to his mother, and his travels to Nigeria. Notwithstanding, \nApplicant established it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and the interests of the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nfamily members in Nigeria live routine lives, they are not involved in politics, employed \nby the Nigerian government or its military forces. Applicant\u2019s contact with his family is \nprimarily through his older brother, who then relays family information back and forth. I \ndo not believe Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family in Nigeria creates a heightened \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, \nI considered Nigeria\u2019s form of government.6 Nigeria is a developing country that, so far, \n \n \n6  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they \nimpose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level \nof security concern or threat it presents to the United States.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \npossess no intelligence, economic, or industrial threat to the United States. \nNotwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights record, there is no evidence its \ngovernment seeks classified and industrial/economic information from the United \nStates. Nor is there evidence of the Nigerian government mistreating relatives of U.S. \ncitizens or U.S. citizens to obtain such information. Additionally, given the existing \nrelationship between the governments of the United States and Nigeria, it is unlikely \nNigeria would risk loosing an important trading partner and the financial support of the \nUnited States. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States\u2019 interests. He has lived in the United States for approximately \n11 years. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen and all of his financial and business interests \nare in the United States. Applicant has established himself as an American citizen. He \nhas worked hard for several government contractors, and at the university earning a \nmaster\u2019s degree. He continues this track record of diligent labor in his current \nemployment. \n \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence shows it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nmother, siblings, or in-laws and the interests of the United States. He has mitigated the \nGuideline B security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been in the United \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nStates for about 11 years and a naturalized U.S. citizen for around five years. He \nattended college courses and received his master\u2019s degree in the United States. His \nwife needs only to be sworn in to complete her U.S. naturalization process, and their \nson was born in the United States. He has many close relatives living in Nigeria with \nwhom he has close ties of affection and or obligation. He and his wife own property and \nhave financial interest only in the United States, and they have embraced the United \nStates way of life. Applicant has worked for several defense contractors and there is no \nevidence that he has failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the \nprotection of classified information. \n \nAfter carefully considering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, I conclude he is not in a \nposition where he may be induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests. He is not vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by his mother, siblings, or the government of Nigeria. \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns arising from \nhis foreign influence security concerns, but failed to mitigate the foreign preference \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

On May 4, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 19, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guidelines F and E had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness had resulted from circumstance beyond his control (medical problems) and that he had\nheld a security clearance for 34 years without incident.  Applicant also argues that his financial\nproblems no longer present a security concern because he obtained a Chapter 7 discharge in\nbankruptcy subsequent to the hearing.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\nerred. \nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Therefore,\nthe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s assertions relating to his subsequent discharge in\nbankruptcy. That evidence does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007). \nThe fact that Applicant has held a security clearance for 34 years without incident was\nimportant evidence for the Judge to consider, particularly when evaluating Applicant\u2019s case under\nthe whole person concept.  A lengthy track record of complying with security procedures may be a\nsignificant factor in mitigation of security concerns presented by problematic conduct or\ncircumstances.  However, the Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record\nunless he specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29,\n2005); ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).  The Judge is not required to cite or\ndiscuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12,\n2007).  The evidence to which Applicant refers is found in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F and the transcript\nof the hearing.  Both of those documents were referenced in the Judge\u2019s Decision\u2014which indicates\nthat they had been reviewed and considered by the Judge.  See Decision at 2-3.  Therefore, on the\nfacts of this case, Applicant has not met his burden of rebutting the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered that favorable evidence.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007).  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\n\n3\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations and had provided false information about his indebtedness in response to two\ndifferent questions on his security clearance application.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still\nowed approximately $49,000 on 31 debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant\nagainst the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited\nby Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guidelines F and E\nis sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Department Counsel having no objection, the additional time was granted. On\nSeptember 29, 2007, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. Department Counsel\nhaving no objections, the document was admitted into evidence as App Ex G. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for financial considerations and personal conduct.\nApplicant in his response to the SOR admits being indebted on the 31 debts listed in the SOR and\nadmits falsifying his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). The\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, I make\nthe following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 67-year-old security officer who has worked for a defense contractor since\n1973 and is seeking to maintain a security clearance.  The loss of Applicant\u2019s clearance would result\nin a pay decrease of $4 per hour and the loss of benefits. (App Ex F) \nApplicant was unemployed from a time in 1974 through a time in 1976.  In August 1981,\nhe quit his job and did not return to his former employer until 1986 or 1987. In 1991, Applicant\u2019s\nwife retired taking a lump-sum retirement payment. (Tr. 27) Both Applicant and his wife receive\nsocial security payments. In 1993, his wife was in a car wreck and broke her neck. (Tr. 49)\nApplicant\u2019s wife is 77-years-old and suffers from high blood pressure, two ruptured disks in her\nlower back, narcolepsy, arthritis, and a thyroid problem. (Tr. 48) Applicant is the primary care giver\nfor his wife. \nIn August 2006, Applicant\u2019s daughter and her two children moved into his home resulting\nin a financial burden.  During their stay, his daughter and children provided only $300 even though\nboth his daughter and grandson were employed full time. Applicant used credit cards to pay his\n\n3\nexpenses, which he now realizes was a big mistake. At one time, Applicant had seven to ten credit\ncards and things got out of hand. \nIn June 2007, Applicant consulted with a financial advisor. (App Ex B) In reviewing his\ndebts with his advisor, they developed a repayment plan where by small payments would be made\nto each of the creditors.  The SOR alleges 31 debts which total $49,000.  Applicant admits to the\ndebts. The worksheet prepared by his advisor lists 37 creditors owed $53,580. The worksheet\nindicates Applicant would make $740 per month in payments. (App Ex C) In June and July 2007,\nfollowing receipt of the SOR, Applicant paid an $84 debt and made $10 per month payments on five\ndebts.  If he were able to make his $740 monthly payments the entire debt would be paid in six years\nif no additional interest or fees accumulated. \nThe hearing was left open so Applicant could consult with his advisor and verify the debt\nand consider the impact of the statute of limitation on his debts.  Following the hearing, he filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (App Ex G) None of the bankruptcy schedules were attached so\nit is impossible to know which debts have been included in the bankruptcy or if it was an asset or\nno asset Chapter 7. The filing has been made, but there is no indication the Chapter 7 has been\naccepted by the bankruptcy court. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income from his job and social security for himself and his wife is\n$4,500.  His monthly expenses total $3,331 leaving a monthly net remainder of $1,174. (App Ex C)\nApplicant has $75,400 equity in his home and $36,000 equity in other personal property.  He also\nowes six acres of land worth approximately $12,000. \nIn 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP).  Question 28 a. asked if he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt during the\nprior seven years.  He answered \u201cno.\u201d  Question 28 b. asked if he was currently more than 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt.  He again answered \u201cno.\u201d Applicant acknowledged he was getting calls from\ncreditors continuously. (Tr. 32) He said he was in a hurry to complete the e-QUIP and his answers\nto the financial questions were an oversight. (Tr. 63) \nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, dated August 2006, sets forth Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline F, financial considerations, and\nGuideline E, personal conduct.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n4\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his\nfinances so as to meet his financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owes approximately $49,000 on 31 debts.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a)\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d apply. \n\n5\nThe only indiction Applicant has attempted to pay the past due debts was in June and July\n2007, after having received the SOR, Applicant paid an $84 debt and made five payments of $10\neach. Following the hearing, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, but failed to\nprovide the schedules showing which debts were included, failed to indicate if this was an asset or\nno asset Chapter 7 or had been accepted by the bankruptcy court. \nMitigating Condition (MC) 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances,\u201d has limited applicability because only one of the debts (SOR 1. ee) was\nmedically related.  Additionally, that $84 debt has been paid. The debts were the result of poor\nfinancial management and unwise use of credit cards.  These debts remain unpaid. \nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. The debts are\nrecent, they are numerous, and incurred under circumstances that cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s good\njudgment. \n There is evidence Applicant sought financial counseling, but he has failed to demonstrate\na positive change in his financial management.  It is not clear the problem is being resolved or under\ncontrol.  MC 20(c) \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply nor does\nMC 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\u201d \nFor MC 20(d) to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay,\nand evidence of a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling his debts\nis needed, which is not present here. Applicant paid an $84 debt and paid a total of $50 to five other\ncreditors.  The other debts remain unpaid and there is no plan for paying them. \nApplicant has been financially irresponsible over a number of years.  He never realized how\nsever his financial situation was until he received the SOR. Applicant has not done enough to\naddress his financial problems. Since receiving the SOR, he had paid $134 and filed Chapter 7\nbankruptcy.  This is too little, too late.\nUnder the personal conduct guideline the concern is that conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nConcern is raised under paragraph 16(a) which is a deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\n\n6\nApplicant was aware of his financial problems. He said he was continuously being called by\nhis creditors. When he completed his e-QUIP he denied he had ever been more than 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt during the prior seven years or was currently more than 90 days delinquent\non any debt.  Applicant has presented no good explanation for why he did not answer the questions\ncorrectly. None of the mitigating factors or conditions apply to his personal conduct. I find\nApplicant falsified his e-QUIP. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. I find against Applicant as to financial considerations and personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 financial considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.cc:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.dd:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1ee:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 personal conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_____________________________\nClaude R.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn an August 24, 2009, response, Applicant admitted the five allegations set forth\nin the SOR and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 5,\n2010. The parties agreed to a hearing date of March 16, 2010. DOHA issued as notice\nof hearing to that effect on February 18, 2010. The hearing was convened as\nscheduled. Department Counsel introduced 15 documents, which were admitted into\nthe record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-15. Department Counsel stipulated that\nthe debt noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e was settled in August 2009.  He also moved to\n1\nJuly 1, 2010\n\n Tr. 64.\n      2\n SOR allegation \u00b6 1.f.\n      3\n SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c.\n      4\n Tr. 33, 35-36.\n      5\n SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d.\n      6\n2\namend the SOR to include the following sentence as allegation \u00b6 1.f: \u201cYou are indebted\nto [a creditor] for a judgment filed in April 2009. It remains unpaid.\u201d  No objection was\n2\ngiven and the motion was granted. Applicant gave testimony and offered eight\ndocuments, which were admitted without objection as Ex. A-H. \nApplicant was given until April 21, 2010, to supplement the record with any\nadditional documents. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on March 24,\n2010. On April 21, 2010, Department Counsel forwarded six additional documents\nwhich were submitted by Applicant between March 23, 2010, and April 21, 2010.\nAbsent any objection to their inclusion, they were accepted into the record as Exs. I-N.\nThe record was then closed. Based on a thorough review of the testimony,\nsubmissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet her burden regarding the\nfinancial considerations security concerns raised. Security clearance denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor and works in\nadministrative services. She has worked for the same employer since 1983. Applicant\nearned a high school diploma. She is married and has five children. Appellant\u2019s oldest\nson and his three children currently live with Applicant.\nOver the years, Applicant put forth great effort and expense to make sure her\nchildren had the opportunity to attend college and have a secure future. As a result, one\ncredit card balance became unwieldy after she provided one son with what he needed\nto start college.  She also co-signed student loans for her oldest son. She made\n3\npayments on those loans until that son completed school and found work, at which\npoint she turned over the responsibility for the loan balance to her son. He defaulted on\nthose loans in 2003, leaving her with an adverse entry on her credit report.  That son is\n4\nnow 35 years old. He and his three children moved in with Applicant in 2009 because\nthey needed a place to live.  These additions to her household have provided additional\n5\nstrain on Applicant\u2019s finances.\nFurther jeopardizing Applicant\u2019s household income is her husband\u2019s declining\nhealth. He began feeling ill in 2008. While ill and undergoing examination, he failed to\nmake timely mortgage payments, as discussed below.  He was diagnosed with an\n6\nadvanced case of adult onset diabetes and now requires both medical treatment and a\nliver transplant. He used his vacation and sick leave time until he was put on a leave of\n\n Tr. 39.\n      7\n Tr. 36.\n      8\n Ex. A (Law firm letter, dated Aug. 28, 2010).\n      9\n Tr. 15; Ex.

He ultimately received disability benefits amounting to a little\nless than half of his usual pay.  He returned to work around July 2009.\n7\n8\nThe accounts at issue in the SOR are as follows:\n1.a \u2013 Collection account ($1,220) \u2013 Satisfied. Applicant offered an August 28, 2009,\nletter showing that the collection agent for this account filed a stipulation discontinuing\naction on her behalf in a lawsuit brought against Applicant.  Because Department\n9\nCounsel found this letter deficient as evidence, Applicant later submitted a March 19,\n2010, letter from the collection agent explicitly confirming that her debt was settled in\nfull.10\n1.b \u2013 1.c \u2013 Collection accounts ($6,217 and $9,015) \u2013 Unresolved. Applicant is the co-\nsigner on her 35-year-old son\u2019s student loans. She made payments on the loans until\nher son finished his studies in 1982 and was able to make the payments himself. He\neventually lost his job and the loans became delinquent in 2003.  Applicant holds her\n11\nson responsible for the loan balances. Applicant was previously unaware of the process\nthrough which a co-signer can be removed from a child\u2019s student loan. She is currently\nseeking to have her name removed from his loans.12\n1.d \u2013 Foreclosure Related Debt ($31,000) \u2013 Debt reduced/current status unclear \u2013\nApplicant\u2019s home loan fell behind when her husband became ill and he neglected to\npay their mortgage.  Applicant was unaware of this failure. When she learned of the\n13\ndebt incurred, she entered a loan modification agreement with her lender pursuant to a\nstandard loan modification.  Under the terms of the agreement, Applicant was to make\n14\nan initial payment of $4,560 on or before August 10, 2009, and two equal monthly\npayments of $1,520.99 beginning on September 1, 2009. The result of this schedule of\npayments was a significant modification of her home loan terms. The Government\nasked Applicant for \u201cevidence of that initial $4,560 and the subsequent payments of the\n$1,520.99. . . .\u201d  As requested, Applicant provided evidence of her initial payment and\n15\nthe two subsequent payments, as well as one additional payment. In sum, she showed\n\n Ex. M (Money Order Records, Aug. - Nov. 2009).\n      16\n Applicant\u2019s testimony, however, implies that regular payments have been made to date, although she\n      17\nconcedes that she thinks her husband may have been late on one or more payments in the preceding six\nmonths. Tr. 41-42.\n Tr. 8, 9; Ex. C (Proof of Settlement, dated Oct. 1, 2009).\n      18\n Tr. 33.\n      19\n Tr. 31-32; Ex. E (W orksheet).\n      20\n Tr. 30; Ex. L (Letter, dated Mar. 16, 2010).

These payments should have\nbrought her substantially current through January 2010.  It is unclear if Applicant failed\n16\nto pay the balance owed on her January 2010 loan payment and her February 2010\npayment, forgot to submit proof of more recent payments,  or simply complied with the\n17\nGovernment\u2019s stated request.\n1.e \u2013 Telecommunications Debt ($567) \u2013 Satisfied. The Government stipulated that this\nmatter was settled.18\n1.f \u2013 Judgment ($7,838) \u2013 In repayment \u2013 A creditor obtained a judgment against\nApplicant for $7,838. The debt arose due to Applicant\u2019s use of a credit card to pay for\ncosts related to a son\u2019s entry into college.  Applicant is satisfying the judgment through\n19\nmonthly payments of $100.  As of March 16, 2010, Applicant had made $800 in\n20\npayments toward the debt.21\nApplicant has a net income of approximately $2,240 per month. Her husband\ncurrently earns about $1,200 each month. Under the home loan modification\nagreement, their monthly mortgage payment is $1,520.99, which is paid primarily\nthrough her husband\u2019s salary. With six individuals currently in her home, Applicant\nspends nearly $1,000 a month on groceries. Combined with their other monthly\nexpenses, their everyday needs and bills exceed Applicant\u2019s income.  She has\n22\nborrowed against her retirement fund to meet her obligations. At work, Applicant is a\nvalued employee who received superior ratings.23\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n24\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n25\n26\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n27\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.28\n\n AG \u00b6 18, which also notes, \u201cAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\n      29\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\n6\nBased upon my consideration of the evidence, Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) is the most pertinent to this case. Disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The guideline sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions. Here,\n29\nApplicant has acquired six obligations, most of which became delinquent in the past few\nyears. To date, her eldest son\u2019s two student loans remain delinquent, a judgment is in\nrepayment, and the status of her home loan is unclear. While she has satisfied two of\nthe debts at issue, such facts are sufficient to raise Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. With such\nconditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case against her and\nmitigate security concerns. \nApplicant has had financial struggles for some time. First, she put her children\nthrough school, then she took in her oldest son and his children. Adding to the strain on\nher family finances, her husband has a serious physical problem and is awaiting a liver\ntransplant. Two of the debts at issue were successfully resolved and two have been put\ninto repayment. The regularity and status of Applicant\u2019s home loan payments are\nunclear, however, and her son\u2019s student loans remain unaddressed. Applicant\nunderstandably expects her 35-year-old son to take responsibility for the student loans\nthat helped her send him to college. Despite her expectations, her son, now a father of\nthree, living with his parents, and making a modest salary, shows no inclination to help\nalleviate his mother\u2019s financial troubles. Meanwhile, Applicant simply does not have the\nfunds to continue paying for his delinquent student loans. Indeed, her present finances\nare insufficient to meet her currently large household\u2019s immediate needs.\nConsequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\ndoes not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s attempts to provide for her family during her husband\u2019s illness, period\nof unemployment, and reliance on disability benefits are sufficient to give rise to FC MC\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances). However, there is no evidence she has received financial\n\n7\ncounseling, obviating application of FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control).\nApplicant satisfied the debts cited at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, and\nnegotiated repayment plans on those cited at \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. The home loan payments\nregarding the debt at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d, however, were sometimes late and there is\nno evidence of the most recent payments. Further, the student loans cited at SOR\nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c continue to be neglected by both Applicant and her son,\nalthough Applicant expressed her intention to have her name removed as a co-signer.\nRegardless, efforts have been made and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies to all the debts\nnoted except those cited at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.\nApplicant has done her best with the income she and her husband currently earn\nto address their daily needs and her delinquent debts. Lacking any significant financial\nhelp from two of her adult sons, however, she is struggling to make payments on a\ncredit card that helped one child go to college. She is waiting for her eldest son to take\nresponsibility for his student loans. Meanwhile, her finances are highly strained by the\nreturn of her eldest son with his children to her household. Consequently, there is\ninsufficient income at present to manage Applicant\u2019s monthly accounts and no\nassurance how the student loans will be resolved. Applicant has failed to provide\nevidence of current financial stability and some indication that her eldest son is capable\nof taking responsibility for his student loans. Financial considerations security concerns\nremain unmitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature, credible, and nurturing woman who has gone to\ntremendous lengths to care for her family and educate her children. Indeed, her\npatience with her son and both his neglect of his student loans and his return to her\nhousehold have, unfortunately, only added to her financial problems. At the same time,\nshe has helped, and continues to help, her husband through his current health issues.\nWhile Applicant has paid two of the debts at issue and negotiated two repayment\nplans, more detailed evidence is needed to establish a consistent track record of home\nloan payments. Moreover, her recounting of her income and expenses plainly shows\nthat she is financially ill-prepared to meet both her eldest son\u2019s family\u2019s needs and her\nown debts. Until these situations are resolved and Applicant receives sound financial\ncounseling to help her and her husband adapt to their current income, financial\nconsiderations security concerns remain unmitigated. Clearance is denied.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a  \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d \n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e  \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f \n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance denied.\nARTHUR E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since 1998. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1986 to 1996, and was honorably discharged as a sergeant (E-4). He joined the Air National Guard and is currently a technical sergeant (E-6). He attended college for a period but did not obtain a degree. He was married from 1990 until his divorce in 2004. He has a 23-year- old child and 18-year-old twin children.1 Applicant started having financial problems after he was discharged from the Air Force. His civilian job did not pay as much as the military. He attended college for a period and his income was further reduced while he was in school. His separation and divorce also had an adverse impact on his finances. Applicant\u2019s industrial security clearance was revoked in 2003, after he did not adequately respond to DOHA interrogatories about his finances. Applicant may have been confused and believed that he was not required to respond because he had a clearance through the Air Force. He responded to DOHA interrogatories in November 2005, and requested reinstatement of his industrial security clearance. He reapplied for his industrial security clearance in November 2006.2 The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling about $7,243. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all the debts alleged in the SOR. Specific debts are addressed below. Applicant attended college from September 2001 through November 200",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 24, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on June 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 6, 2009. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \nAugust 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n11, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were received without objection. The record \nwas held open for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted four \npages of documents, which were marked AE F through I, and admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 1998. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1986 to 1996, \nand was honorably discharged as a sergeant (E-4). He joined the Air National Guard \nand is currently a technical sergeant (E-6). He attended college for a period but did not \nobtain a degree. He was married from 1990 until his divorce in 2004. He has a 23-year-\nold child and 18-year-old twin children.1  \n \n \nApplicant started having financial problems after he was discharged from the Air \nForce. His civilian job did not pay as much as the military. He attended college for a \nperiod and his income was further reduced while he was in school. His separation and \ndivorce also had an adverse impact on his finances. Applicant\u2019s industrial security \nclearance was revoked in 2003, after he did not adequately respond to DOHA \ninterrogatories about his finances. Applicant may have been confused and believed that \nhe was not required to respond because he had a clearance through the Air Force. He \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories in November 2005, and requested reinstatement of \nhis industrial security clearance. He reapplied for his industrial security clearance in \nNovember 2006.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling about $7,243. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted to all the debts alleged in the SOR. Specific debts are \naddressed below. \n \n \nApplicant attended college from September 2001 through November 2001. He \nwas activated in December 2001, following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He \nstopped attending the university. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges $6,031 owed to the university for \nhis tuition from 2001. Applicant hoped to have the tuition paid through his GI Bill, but he \ndid not apply for the benefits before he left school. He paid $500 to the attorney \nhandling the debt on July 8, 2009, and has a payment plan to pay $100 per month until \nthe debt is paid.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 19-20, 23, 37-38; GE 1-5. \n \n2 Tr. at 20-24; GE 1-5. \n \n3 Tr. at 20-22, 28-31, 39-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5; AE G. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant settled in full the delinquent debt of $180 owed to a telephone services \ncompany, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, with a payment of $130 on March 10, 2009.4   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a delinquent debt of $1,032 owed to a bank. Applicant paid or \nsettled this debt in full with a payment of $1,100 on March 4, 2009.5  \n \n \nApplicant has not received credit counseling. He does not have an excess of \ndisposable income, but with discipline he will be able to pay the monthly payments on \nhis university debt, and remain financially solvent.6 \n \n \nApplicant has been very active in the Air National Guard. He has been activated \nand deployed on several occasions. He has served in Iraq and in other overseas \nlocations. Letters on his behalf from his civilian employer and military personnel praise \nhis integrity, loyalty, intensity, passion, patriotism, dedication, leadership, and \nprofessionalism. He is recommended for a security clearance.7  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 22, 25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE H, I. \n \n5 Tr. at 22, 25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B. \n \n6 Tr. at 31-34, 38. \n7 Tr. at 21, 23, 34-35; GE 4, 5; AE A, C-E. \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant has not yet completely resolved the largest debt alleged in the SOR. \nHis financial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems started after he left active duty in 1996. His civilian salary was lower \nthan his military pay. He attended college for a period and earned even less. He had to \nleave college after he was activated in December 2001, leaving him with a large tuition \nbill. His finances were further damaged by his separation and divorce. These conditions \nwere not completely within his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires \nthat the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. The above events all \noccurred some time ago and Applicant did not begin to address his delinquent debts \nuntil March 2009. He only recently began to truly act responsibly about his finances. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) is minimally applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has paid two of his debts and initiated a payment plan on the third. I \nfind that he has made a good-faith effort to pay his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is \napplicable. He has not received financial counseling, but there are clear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved and is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable service in the Air Force and the Air National Guard. He has risked \nlife and limb and deployed on several occasions. He has not completely resolved all his \ndelinquent debts, but he credibly testified that he plans to address all his delinquent \ndebt. The Appeal Board has noted that an applicant is not required to establish that he \nhas paid every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant must \ndemonstrate that he has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken \nsignificant actions to implement that plan.\u201d8 I find that Applicant has established a plan \nto resolve his financial problems and has taken significant action to implement that plan. \nHis finances do not constitute a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8 ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On October 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nG and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 5, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 23, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 23,\n2008, and I received the case assignment on January 25, 2008. DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on February 12, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 6,\n2008. The government offered four exhibits (GE), marked 1 through 4, which were\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated March 16, 2006) at 1, 6, 25; Tr. 25-26.\n1\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 9-10, 12-13; Tr. 27, 56-59.\n2\nTr. 27, 29-33.\n3\n2\n \nreceived without objection. Applicant and two witnesses testified on his behalf. He\nsubmitted four exhibits (AE), marked A through D, which were received without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 14, 2008, and the\nrecord closed on the same day. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nThe file indicates that Applicant received the hearing notice on February 21,\n2008, less than 15 days before the scheduled hearing date. (Tr. at 9.) I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. Id. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 23, 2007, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations in the SOR, \nApplicant, who is 43 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\na production controller. He began work for this contractor in 1983. Since that time, he\ngraduated from apprentice school in 1988 as a pipe fitter and completed his Associate\nof Arts degree in science in 1997. He has held a security clearance since 1985, without\nincident.1\nApplicant married in 1987. He and his wife separated in 2001 and divorced in\n2003. He has a daughter, age 12, and a son, age 10.  Although his children live with his\nex-wife, he regularly visits them. Because he and his wife continue to disagree over\nissues related to the children, he currently participates in a family counseling program\nwith his children and sometimes his ex-wife. Through this program, they are learning to\ninteract with each other in a different way.2\nShortly after he graduated from high school, Applicant began smoking marijuana\noccasionally with friends at parties about once a month. He also began drinking\nregularly. Before he married, he drank a couple of beers every night or every other\nnight.3\nIn 1985, he and friends drank beer for a period of time. He then drove his car.\nThe police stopped him because he was speeding. The police officer smelled alcohol\n\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 23; Tr. 34-36.\n4\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 22-23; Tr. 36-37.\n5\nTr. 30-33.\n6\nGE 2, (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, criminal records report) at 2;\n7\nTr. 37-39.\nTr. 30-33.\n8\n3\n \nand performed a breathalyzer test. Applicant thinks his blood-alcohol was around .13.\nThe police officer charged him with driving under the influence (DUI). He pled guilty to\nDUI. The court sentenced him to attend an alcohol education program.4\nOne year later, in 1986, the police again stopped him for speeding. He had been\ndrinking beer with friends. The police officer smelled beer and administered a\nbreathalyzer test. Applicant thinks his test result was again a .13. The police officer\nissued a second DUI citation. He pled guilty to DUI. The court sentenced him to attend a\nsubstance abuse education program and restricted his driving privileges for one year.5\nAfter he married in 1987, Applicant continued to drink at a modest level. From\n1990 until 1996, he worked the second shift for his employer. During this time, he did\nnot frequent bars nor did he drink at home after work.6\nHe and his ex-wife argued one evening in June 1993. She wanted to go out of\nthe house for entertainment. He wanted to stay home and do his school work. His ex-\nwife blocked his entrance or exit from the room where they were arguing. He\n\u201coverreacted\u201d and kicked her in the shin. She called the police, who arrested and\ncharged him with assault and battery. The court entered a finding similar to probation\nbefore judgment, and directed he and his ex-wife to attend marital counseling, which\nthey did for six months. The court never entered a verdict against him on these\ncharges.7\nIn 1996, he returned to working the day shift. He began drinking alcohol again -\ntwo or three beers every other day at home or in bars. Over the next one to two years,\nhe increased both the quantity and the frequency of his alcohol consumption. By 1998,\nhe drank at least four to six beers on a daily basis. At this time, he attributed his\nincreased alcohol consumption to problems in his marriage.  \n8\nApplicant and his ex-wife fought again in July 1999 after he had been drinking\nalcohol. He walked into their bedroom and laid down on the bed, intending to go to\nsleep. She argued with him about his condition (meaning his condition after drinking\nalcohol). At some point, he grabbed a chair and threw it over his head, not looking\nbehind him. The chair hit his wife. At this point, she wanted to leave the house. He\npleaded with her to stay and would not allow her to leave. The police arrived at their\nhouse at some point, and charged him with assault and kidnaping. They appeared in\n\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 22; GE 2, supra note 7, at 2; Tr. 39-42.\n9\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 17, 21; GE 2, supra note 7, at 2; Tr. 28-30, 42-43.\n10\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 20; Tr. 43-45.\n11\nTr. 45-46.\n12\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 19; Tr. 46. \n13\n4\n \ncourt at a later date. The court made no finding of guilt. Instead, the court entered a\nfinding similar to probation before judgment, contingent upon completion of counseling\nfor alcohol and family relationships. He completed the counseling as required.9\nIn August 2000, the police stopped Applicant for a traffic violation. As a result of\nthe stop, the police charged him with possession of marijuana and DUI, based on a\nbreathalyzer result of .08. At his court hearing, the State nol prossed the DUI charge.\nThe court found him guilty of possession of marijuana (first offender) and directed him to\nattend the same substance abuse program he had previously attended and restricted\nhis driving privileges for a time. Applicant attended an alcohol and drug abuse program\nfor a year. He acknowledged he relapsed after this program but finally quit using\nmarijuana in 2002. He no longer associates with his friends who smoke marijuana. He,\nhowever, continued to drink.10\nLess than two years later, in June 2002 after an evening of drinking beer with\nfriends, the police again arrested Applicant for DUI and reckless driving. The police\nobserved him parked in his car in a parking lot. When the police arrived at his car, they\nnoticed the keys in the ignition. The breathalyzer test revealed a blood-alcohol level of\n.13. The State nol prossed his DUI charge. The court found him guilty of reckless driving\nand fined him.11\nOne year later, the police stopped him for a traffic violation again. He failed the\nsobriety test given after he pulled his car off the road and into a parking lot. The police\ncharged him with DUI. The State amended the charge to drunkenness. He pled guilty\nand the court fined him.12\nA few months later, in October 2003, he spent the evening drinking with friends\nat a bar. After he left, he stopped to urinated. The police saw him and arrested him for\npublic urination.  He paid a $79 fine.13\nApplicant\u2019s last DUI occurred in May 2007. The police stopped him for speeding.\nThe police officer smelled alcohol and performed a breathalyzer test. The police\ncharged Applicant with DUI based on his blood-alcohol level of .08. Applicant pled guilty\nto DUI. The court sentenced him to 180 days in jail, which was suspended; fined him\n\nGE 4 (Attachment to answers to interrogatories) at 4-5; AE A (Verification he completed state substance\n14\nabuse program); Tr. 46-47.\nGE 3 (Attachment to answers to interrogatories) at 5-8, 10; Tr. 47-48.\n15\nGE 3, supra note 14, at 10; GE 4, supra note 13, at 6; AE B (Letter, dated March 4, 2008) AE C (Copy of\n16\nprescription); AE D (AA notes of Applicant) at 1-2; Tr. 48-51. At the hearing, Applicant showed me a notebook\noutlining all the AA meetings he has attended since last May. Tr. 22-24. \nTr. 53-60.\n17\n5\n \n$250; directed he attend alcohol counseling, which he did; and restricted his driving\nprivileges for one year.14\nUp until May 2007, Applicant believed he had his alcohol consumption under\ncontrol. When the police arrested him in May 2007, he realized that he had a problem\nwith alcohol. He contacted a co-worker, who is a recovering alcoholic and a member of\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA), on the night of his arrest and asked for help. His co-worker\ndirected him to AA, challenged him to complete 90 AA meetings in 90 days, and\nrecommended he enroll in an in-patient treatment program. Applicant immediately\nstarted attending AA meetings and scheduled an appointment with the Director of an in-\npatient program.  \n15\nApplicant met with the in-patient program director, a medical doctor, about two\nweeks after his arrest in May 2007, for an evaluation. The doctor diagnosed him with\nalcohol dependence, a diagnosis with which Applicant agrees. The doctor\nrecommended in-patient treatment and use of Campral, a medication used to help him\nabstain from alcohol. The in-patient treatment program admitted Applicant immediately\nafter his evaluation.  He completed 18 three-hour sessions, which included group\ntherapy, psycho education, family education, and randon urine drug screens and\nbreathalyzer tests. He also attended 12 step meetings while in the program. He\npresented in-group, a detail autobiography, which included personal information on his\nfamily dynamic, school, significant events, and other matters. He successfully\ncompleted the program. He now attends their after care program and AA up to five\ntimes a week.  He continues to take Campral. Applicant considers AA a strong support\nsystem for him. If he misses a few meetings, he feels something is missing in his life.\nHe accepts that he is an alcoholic and understands that he rationalized his past alcohol\nconsumption to avoid admitting a problem.16\nApplicant\u2019s current lady friend testified. They have been dating for the last 4 \u00bd\nyears. While she observed him drinking alcohol, she did not realize that he had a\nserious problem because he was not blatantly drunk. He has never been physically\nabusive to her.  She describes his relationship with his children as caring. He always\ntries to do the right thing. He is very diligent about managing his alcohol problem. She\ntalks with him every day and sees him on the weekends only, because of his\nattendance at AA. She also stated that he goes to family counseling with his children\nand ex-wife to work out issues concerning visitation.17\n\nTr. 63-76.\n18\n6\n \nIn addition to his testimony about his support for Applicant\u2019s alcohol treatment,\nhis co-worker stated that Applicant missed time from work, but he does not know if his\nabsence was due to alcohol. Applicant\u2019s attendance has improved more recently. He\nnever observed Applicant under the influence of alcohol at work. Applicant also came\nvery close to meeting the 90-day challenge.18\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n7\n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable\nconditions;) \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation;\n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated\nrehabilitation program; and,\n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a\ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and\nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year. \nIn a period of 13 months in the middle 1980s, the police arrested Applicant twice\nfor DUI. For each offense, the court sentenced him to substance abuse education\nprograms. During the 1990s, the police arrested Applicant twice for assault and battery\nrelated to a fight with his ex-wife. Starting in 2000, the police arrested and charged\nApplicant on five separate occasions for alcohol related incidents. Based on his\nnumerous arrests over the last 22 years, AG \u00b6 31(a) applies. None of the remaining\npotentially disqualifying conditions are applicable in this case. \n\nThe mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 32(a), (c), and (e) are not applicable in this case.\n19\n8\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 32, the following conditions that could mitigate the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns:\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.19\nAll but one of Applicant\u2019s criminal charges arose because of his consumption of\nalcohol. After his first two arrests for DUI in the middle 1980s, he did not have another\nalcohol related arrest for 13 years. Since 1999, the police have arrested him six times\nfor alcohol related offenses. After his last arrest, Applicant sought alcohol treatment\nbecause he finally realized he had a problem. Since his last arrest, he has not\nconsumed any alcohol and has actively and continuously participated in alcohol\ntreatment programs, including in-patient treatment and AA. He continues to work\nregularly. AA provides a strong support to help him remain sober. The evidence of\nrecord indicates he has rehabilitated himself and is continuing to work on maintaining\nsobriety.  As long as he remains sober, there is little likelihood of future criminal\nconduct. Thus, AG \u00b6 32 (d) has some applies. \nIn 1993 and 1999, Applicant and his wife fought. He acknowledges overreacting\nand losing control in these situations. These two incidents related to escalating\narguments with his ex-wife. He has not been involved in any incidents of physical\nassaults with his current lady friend, a relationship which has existed for over four years\nand long enough to reflect that violence is not part of the relationship.  In, addition, he\nand his ex-wife are undergoing family counseling to learn how to communicate with\neach other. Thus, AG \u00b632(b) has some applicability because he is no longer married\nand does not have a volatile relationship with his current lady friend.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\n\nThe disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and (f) are not raised in this case.\n20\n9\n \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in\nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence; and\n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education,\nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence.\nFor many years, Applicant has consumed alcohol on a daily basis and in\nexcessive quantities. His habitual alcohol consumption has resulted in eight arrests for\nDUI or public urination, and assault and battery. All of these incidents occurred after\nwork hours and away from the work site. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c) apply. AG \u00b6 22(b) does\nnot apply, since the record does not contain any evidence of alcohol-related incidents at\nwork.\nA medical doctor diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent in May 2007, a\ndiagnosis Applicant acknowledges is correct. To help the treatment of his alcohol\ndependence, Applicant takes Campral. AG \u00b6 22(d) applies. However, AG \u00b6 22 (g) does\nnot apply as Applicant has always complied with court orders regarding alcohol\neducation and treatment. Since he stopped consuming alcohol in May 2007, he has\nremained abstinent. Likewise, he has honored his decision not to use marijuana for\nalmost six years.20\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\n\n10\n \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nGiven it has been less than a year since Applicant stopped consuming alcohol,\nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. However, the remaining mitigating conditions must be\naddressed. Applicant acknowledges that he is alcohol dependent. He successfully\ncompleted an intensive in-patient treatment program in August 2007. During this\nprogram, he developed an after-care treatment plan. He follows this plan, which\nincludes almost daily AA meetings. Through AA, he has established a support network\nto help him maintain sobriety. His evidence indicates his participation in AA and his\nwitnesses confirm his determination to remain sober. Prior to May 2007, he participated\nin one alcohol rehabilitation program, and he attended several alcohol education\nprograms as directed by the court. He has not relapsed since recognizing he had an\nalcohol problem and needed help. He continues with his medication and after-care\nprograms.  Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b6 23 (b) and (c) are applicable and AG \u00b6 23(d) is partially\napplicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n\n11\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant began drinking as a young\nman, at the end of high school. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) As a result of his early alcohol\nconsumption, the police stopped him twice and charged him with DUI. After these\narrests, Applicant continued to drink, but more responsibly. For nearly six years, he did\nnot consume alcohol. In 1996, he resumed drinking alcohol. Problems developed in his\nmarriage and he managed this stress by increasing his alcohol consumption. From\n1999 until May 2007, he continued to drink to excess. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1), (2), (3), and\n(5).) Since that time, Applicant has changed his attitude and behavior in regards to his\nalcohol consumption. He recognized and accepted that he needed help because he\ncould not control his alcohol use. Upon the suggestion of a trusted co-worker, he started\nattending AA meetings immediately after his last DUI and sought in-patient treatment.\nHe successfully completed his in-patient treatment and continues to follow his after-care\nplan. He relies on AA and its well-established program to provided the support he needs\nto continue with sobriety. He has embraced the AA\u2019s concepts and philosophies about\nthe detrimental effects of alcohol consumption in his life. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(6) and (7).)\nHe has been very open and candid about his alcohol abuse and his treatment. There is\nlittle likelihood he can be coerced, exploited or pressured into revealing classified\ninformation based on his past alcohol consumption. His criminal conduct can be directly\nrelated to his alcohol consumption. As long as he remains sober, something he is\ncommitted to doing, there is little likelihood that his criminal conduct will reoccur. (See\nAG & 2(a)(8).) During the 23 years he has held a security clearance, he has not\ncompromised classified information and is not likely to do so in the future. While his\nlength of sobriety is 10 months, this length of time is insufficient to raise security\nconcerns because of his strong commitment to sobriety as shown by his AA attendance,\nwhich indicates his determination to remain sober. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and\nalcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\n \nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Borgstrom, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n June 12, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn October 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested an Administrative\nDetermination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel issued a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) on December 6, 2007. Applicant did not respond to the\nFORM. The case was assigned to me on April 1, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\nSOR Response.\n1\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born in Jordan. At some point he moved to the United States. He\nmarried his current wife in 1987. She became a United States citizen in 1989. He\nbecame a United States citizen in 1993. They have three children, all of whom were\nborn in the United States.\nApplicant has had a United States passport since 1995. He also possesses a\nJordanian passport, which he last renewed in 2005. He used the Jordanian passport in\nlieu of his United States passport on several occasions, most recently for trips to Jordan\nin 2003 and 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, three married sisters, a niece, and four of his brothers are\ncitizens and residents of Jordan. Three other brothers are citizens of Jordan. In his\nresponse to the SOR, applicant stated he maintains \u201cfamilial\u201d contact with these family\nmembers. He added that contact with his mother is \u201climited to casual phone calls,\u201d and\ncontact with his four brothers residing in Jordan and his sisters is \u201cvery limited to casual\ncommunication on holidays and special occasions.\u201d\nOne of applicant\u2019s brothers-in-law is an engineer in the Jordanian Air Force. His\ncommunication with him is \u201climited to casual communication.\u201d1\nApplicant is part owner of a factory and two houses in Jordan. Applicant pays no\nexpenses, and receives no income, from these property interests, which were inherited\nfrom his father. In addition to the 2003 and 2005 trips to Jordan mentioned above,\napplicant traveled to Jordan in 2006 and 2007.\nDuring an interview with an OPM investigator in November 2006, applicant stated\nhe used his Jordanian passport in lieu of his United States passport to travel to Jordan\nbecause it allowed him to stay in Jordan as long as he wanted. He would have been\nlimited to 30 days if he used his United States passport.  He also stated that he feels\nsome loyalty toward Jordan \u201cas it is the country of his birth and his mother and some of\nhis siblings still live there.\u201d He added, however, that the United States \u201cholds his\nultimate loyalty\u201d as his family, career and future are here. Lastly, he stated that he is\nwilling to renounce his Jordanian citizenship and give up his Jordanian passport if\nnecessary to receive a security clearance, something he reiterated in his SOR\nresponse.\nThe Government provided seven official United States publications with the\nFORM (Exhibits 6 through 12) that describe the economic, political and intelligence\nactivities of Jordan and terrorists operating within Jordan. I take administrative notice of\nthe following facts found therein:\n\n3\nJordan, which has a population of approximately 5.9 million, is a constitutional\nmonarchy that is pro-Western. Although the government respected human rights in\nsome areas, its overall record continued to reflect problems. While in Jordan, American\ncitizens who also possess Jordanian nationality may be subject to laws that impose\nspecial obligations on Jordanian citizens.\nCombating terrorism has been a major problem for Jordan. United States\npersonnel and assets in Jordan have been targeted by terrorists in recent years.\nTerrorists use overt, covert, and clandestine activities to exploit and undermine United\nStates national security interests.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.e., \u201ca substantial\nbusiness, financial, or property interest in a foreign country . . .\u201d may be disqualifying.\nLastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which\nmay make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country\u201d may be disqualifying.\nApplicant maintains \u201cfamilial\u201d contact with his immediate family members residing\nin Jordan. He has also traveled to Jordan at least four times since 2003. Applicant\u2019s\npresence in Jordan during these trips made him and his family members potentially\nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by not only the Jordanian government,\nbut also by terrorists operating in Jordan. These facts raise concerns under Paragraphs\n7.a., 7.b., and 7.i. Paragraph 7.e. is not applicable because applicant\u2019s interests in a\nfactory and two houses in Jordan do not appear to be substantial.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\n\n5\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s contacts\nwith his parents and siblings in Jordan are consistent and ongoing. His familial\nrelationship with them creates a risk of foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant failed\nto provide sufficient credible evidence that it is unlikely he would be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign government and the interests of\nthe United States, or that he is not vulnerable to a conflict of interest.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10.a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as possession of a current foreign passport, may be disqualifying.\nUnder Paragraph 10.b., taking action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen may also be disqualifying. The fact that applicant\nrenewed and used a Jordanian passport after he became a United States citizen\nrequires application of these two disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. Under Paragraph 11.a.,\nit may be mitigating if the \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth\nin a foreign country.\u201d And, under Paragraph 11.b., it may be mitigating if \u201cthe individual\nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d Both mitigating conditions\nare applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\n\n6\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born in Jordan. Although he has spent most if not all of his adult\nlife in the United States, he still has significant ties and some level of loyalty to Jordan\nand to his immediate family members living there, as evidenced by his dual citizenship,\nhis statement that he still feels some loyalty to Jordan, his trips to Jordan, and the\n\u201cfamilial\u201d relationships he maintains with his family members. His voluntary actions could\nleave him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure and could cause the future\ncompromise of classified information. I have carefully reviewed the administrative\nrecord, applicant*s submissions, and the allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and I have evaluated\napplicant*s conduct in light of the whole person concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive. After doing so, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the\nGovernment\u2019s case under Guidelines B and C.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On September 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR, which he answered in writing on September 18,\n2008. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the\nrequest on September 25, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nJanuary 14, 2009\n\nResponse to SOR.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated September 27, 2007).\n2\nTwo brothers died in separate accidents in 1976.

DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on November 10, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on December 10, 2008. The government offered eight exhibits (GE), 1\nthrough 8, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\nand one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted seven exhibits (AE), A through G,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. In addition, the\ngovernment offered GE 9 and the Applicant offered two decisions by colleagues, which\nare marked as Hearing Exhibit 1. These exhibits were admitted for administrative notice\npurposes only. The record closed on December 10, 2008. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on December 16, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Taiwan. (Tr. 16.) The request and the attached documents\nwere not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record as GE 9. Applicant\nsubmitted two recent decisions by DOHA administrative judges, who granted\nclearances to individuals from Taiwan, which are marked as Hearing Exhibit 1, asked\nthat I take administrative notice of these decisions. (Tr. 38.) The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. After a thorough\nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.1\nApplicant, who is 50 years old, works as an engineer and technical staff person\nfor a Department of Defense contractor. He has worked for this contractor since 2003.2\nApplicant, the youngest of six sons,  was born and raised in Taiwan. He\n3\ngraduated from a public Taiwanese university with a degree in mechanical engineering\nin 1980. Upon his graduation, he served his legally required two years of duty in the\nTaiwan military, performing administrative duties. He achieved the rank of sergeant and\nreceived an honorable discharge. He did not hold a security clearance while in the\n\nUnder the laws of Taiwan, all male citizens are required to serve in the military.

Two brothers also served in the Taiwan military as required by law. His third\nbrother was exempt from service because he did not meet the height requirement.4\nIn June 1983, Applicant married a Taiwanese woman. Shortly thereafter, they\nimmigrated to the United States (U.S.) and he entered graduate school. He completed a\nmaster\u2019s degree at a major U.S. university. He has worked in the U.S. at U.S.\ncompanies since his graduation. He and his wife have two children, ages 16 and 14,\nwho are U.S. citizens by birth and reside in the U.S. He became a naturalized citizen in\n1996. His wife is also a U.S. citizen. In 2002, they adopted his wife\u2019s Taiwanese niece\nunder U.S. law to help her obtain a better education. In 2007, he and his wife divorced.\nThey have joint and shared physical custody of their two children. Since the divorce,\nApplicant has had little contact with his adopted daughter (niece), who is a college\nstudent, a Taiwan citizen and a permanent U.S. resident. She is now eligible for U.S.\ncitizenship and plans to apply for it.5\nApplicant\u2019s mother died in an earthquake in 1999. His father received injuries in\nthe same earthquake. His father died in 2007. In the last few years prior to his death,\nApplicant\u2019s father required extensive hospital care. Because of his father\u2019s health\nissues. Applicant visited his father five times between December 2003 and August\n2007. Applicant returned to Taiwan for his father\u2019s funeral in October 2007. Six weeks\nafter his father\u2019s funeral, Applicant returned to Taiwan once more to sign papers\nrelinquishing any inheritance rights under his father\u2019s estate. He saw his brothers during\nthese visits.6\nApplicant\u2019s three living brothers are citizens of and reside in Taiwan. One brother\nworks in fundraising for a private university in Taiwan. In November 2008, a second\nbrother retired, after 30 years, from his human resources job at a private company. His\nretirement income comes from investments, not the Taiwanese government. His third\nbrother closed his fish farm. He now works for a private security company at desk\nsecurity for his residence. Applicant considers this brother semi-retired. Two brothers\nare married and one is divorced. All three have children in Taiwan. His two sisters-in law\nwork for private companies. His brothers have not held political office or worked in a\ngovernment job. One brother has traveled to the U.S. to raise money for his university,\nand while in the U.S., stayed one night with Applicant. Since his father died 15 months\nago, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his older brother have declined to about twice a year. His\ncontacts with his other brothers are about twice a year. He has two aunts still alive and\nliving in Taiwan. He has not had any contact with them since leaving Taiwan in 1983.  \n7\n\nResponse to SOR; AE E; AE F; Tr. 46, 65.\n8\nAE G (Retirement accounts); AE H (Deed); AE I (Deed); Tr. 56, 65, 67, 70.\n9\nTr. 19-27.\n10\nId. 42, 56, 70.\n11\n22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3316 \n12\n4\nPrior to his present employment, Applicant worked for two companies, which\nrequired him to travel to Taiwan on business. Between January 2001 and October 2003,\nApplicant made nine business trips to Taiwan. He traveled on his U.S. passport, which\nhe has used for international travel since becoming a U.S. citizen.8\nApplicant does not have any financial interest in Taiwan. All his financial interests\nare in the U.S. He owns a house, valued at $500,000, and an investment property,\nvalued at $600,000. His debt on both properties totals $530,000. He also has a 401K\naccount and another retirement account, with a total value of approximately $170,000.\nHe pays his taxes every year and has voted in every U.S. election since becoming a\ncitizen. He does not provide any financial support to his brothers in Taiwan.  \n9\nApplicant\u2019s department manager and former direct supervisor testified on his\nbehalf. He describes Applicant as a conscientious, committed, motivated, honest, and\nintelligent worker with a very good work ethic. Applicant is an excellent performer with\nunique skills. The witness indicated that their work group does not normally handle\nclassified information, but must test the technology hardware they develop in a\nclassified laboratory. Occasionally, his staff may have access to classified information\nand future projects may necessitate a security clearance. He would trust Applicant with\nclassified information.10\nApplicant describes himself as a very loyal American. His closest ties are to his\ntwo children who live in the U.S. He has chosen to invest in the U.S., not Taiwan. He\nintends to remain in the U.S., where he has deep roots.11\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. In 1949, Chinese refugees fled\na civil war in mainland China to the Island of Taiwan. That same year, Communists in\nmainland China established the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), and these refugees\nestablished a separate, independent government in Taiwan. The PRC does not\nrecognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China\u201d. \n Taiwan is a multiparty democracy, a U.S. ally, and a major trading partner.\nThrough nearly five decades of hard work and sound economic management, Taiwan\nhas transformed itself from an underdeveloped, agricultural island to a power that is a\nleading producer of high-technology goods. On January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally\nrecognized the PRC as the sole legal government of China. The U.S. also announced\nthat it would maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people\non Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA),  which was signed into law on April 10,\n12\n\nThe PRC\u2019s Military Intelligence Department\u2019s main intelligence target is Taiwan.\n13\n5\n1979, created the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the U.S. and\nTaiwan. \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. policy. The\nU.S. does not support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership\nin appropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nwhich it joined in 2002, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the\nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for\nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive\ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to\nTaiwan, in accordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the\nU.S. would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a substantial\nsale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine aircraft, and\ndiesel submarines. \nMore recently, U.S.-Taiwan relations have changed. Taiwan\u2019s new president\ndisavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus quo\u201d that\nthere is only one China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the more\nprovocative position that Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a\n\u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain. While still pursuing a close relationship with\nTaiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing criticisms of the PRC military buildup\nopposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and warnings to the effect that U.S. support for\nTaiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.\nTaiwan\u2019s Constitution provides its citizens with many rights similar to those\nprovided to U.S. citizens. It has a good human rights record. It maintains a large military\nestablishment whose primary mission is the defense of Taiwan against the PRC.  On\n13\nthe other hand, Taiwan is an active collector of defense, medical, economic, and\ncomputer information through industrial espionage. There are reports of cases involving\nthe export of certain devices to Taiwan without approval of the Department of\nCommerce. \nThe government claims through Administrative Notice that Taiwan poses a threat\nto national security because, in the past, it was one of the countries most actively\nengaged in industrial espionage and the collection of foreign economic information. The\nrequest cites to the Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage of 2000. This report lists Taiwan as one of the most active\ncollectors of industrial and economic intelligence. However, the government also\nattached to its request the more recent Annual report from 2005 which was dated\nAugust 2006. The report does not list Taiwan as being one of the biggest collectors of\neconomic and industrial espionage. It does list the PRC and Russia as the most active\ncollectors. The report states the U.S. is targeted by a large number of foreign countries\nfor economic and industrial espionage. The report notes that the foreign private sector is\n\nAll of the information about Taiwan is contained in GE 9.\n14\n6\nthe most active collector of this type of economic and industrial intelligence, but there is\nample evidence that foreign intelligence services and other government organizations\nremain aggressive in collecting information by using the private sector to collect\ninformation for them and by their own continued direct intelligence gathering operations.\nTaiwan does not appear to be any more active in the collection of economic and\nindustrial intelligence than many other allied countries. \nThe government also presented information concerning individuals in the U.S.\nconvicted of engaging in espionage practices on behalf of Taiwanese companies or\nofficials, as well as companies that violate export control requirements in sending items\nto Taiwan. Where companies are involved, the government has not identified any\nspecific individuals of Taiwanese descent as the person responsible for the decision to\nviolate U.S. law. Some of these cases involve individuals in the U.S., native born and\nforeign born and citizens and non-citizens of the U.S., that formed friendships with\nTaiwan Intelligence agents and then provided the agents with classified information.\nWhile the government presented information only on Taiwan cases, it is not difficult to\nassume that there are cases that pertain to other countries as well. The fact that there\nare cases of Taiwan intelligence agents accepting intelligence information from sources\nin the U.S., no matter how obtained, does raise security concerns. \nThe geographical closeness of Taiwan and the PRC causes Taiwan concern and\ncan led it to engage in industrial, military, and economic espionage to ensure that it is\nstrong enough to counter threats from the PRC. However, that threat is counter\nbalanced by the need of Taiwan to continue friendly relations with the U.S. as one of its\nprime protectors and sources of military equipment. The relationship between the U.S.\nand Taiwan is defined in the Taiwan Relations Act which recognizes Taiwan. Taiwan\nhas a long history of friendly relations with the U.S., including substantial levels of\nforeign trade. Taiwan is an ally and friend, but also poses a security threat because of\nits activities and efforts to obtain economic, industrial, and national security\ninformation.14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n15\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing they have no opportunity\nto observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States v. Raddatz,\n447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence\u201d and, in United States v. First City\nNational Bank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means\n\u201cthat the court should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . .\ngive any special weight to the [prior] determination of \u201cthe administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\n7\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n15\n\njudicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial error).\n8\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\n\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family members could not\n16\nbe mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family members were not in a position to be exploited.\nThe Appeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise\nwas that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice between the\ninterest of the family member and the interest of the United States. (See, ISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd,\nApr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb.\n15, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)). Thus, an administrative judge was not\npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.\n9\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nSince his divorce, Applicant has not had any contact with his former wife\u2019s family.\nThus, no security concern is raised by any contacts his former wife may have with her\nfamily. His two children are citizens and residents of the U.S. Thus, his relationship with\nhis children is not a security concern.  His adopted daughter (former wife\u2019s niece) is a\npermanent resident of the U.S., who is planning on becoming a U.S. citizen. She is in\ncollege. Since he does not have any contact with her following his divorce, there is no\nsecurity concern related to her. However, Applicant\u2019s three brothers are citizens and\nresidents of Taiwan. Applicant maintains a normal, but limited, familial relationship with\nhis brothers. These relationships are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. The government must establish that these family relationships create a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\nor would create a potential conflict of interest between his obligations to protect\nsensitive information and his desire to help his family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the government of\nTaiwan. See ISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). The risk that an\nApplicant could be targeted for manipulation or induced into compromising classified\ninformation is real, not theoretical. Applicant\u2019s relationship and contacts with his\nbrothers in Taiwan raises a heightened risk of security concerns because Taiwan does\nengage in economic, industrial, and other types of espionage, and Taiwan officials and\ncompanies have engaged in such espionage with individuals in the U.S. There are no\nindications in these instances that Taiwan targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation. Taiwan and its intelligence agents did receive protected information from\npersons in the U.S., but in these cases the information was offered to the agents by the\nU.S. citizens rather than Taiwan targeting the U.S. citizens by exploiting, manipulating,\npressuring, or coercing U.S. citizens for protected information. The government has not\nestablished a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure or coercion by the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the PRC. The geographic\ncloseness might induce Taiwan to obtain protected information from U.S. sources, but in\nobtaining that information Taiwan does not use tactics and methods that could cause\nissues with the U.S. as its main protector and supplier of military equipment. \nUnder the new guidelines, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.  In determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts in Taiwan cause security concerns, I\n16\n\n10\nconsidered that Taiwan is an ally of the U.S., has a defense agreement with the U.S.,\nand is a substantial trading partner of the U.S. I considered that the people of Taiwan\nenjoy basic freedoms similar to U.S. citizens. While the U.S. has a one-China policy, the\nU.S. does maintain cultural, commercial and other ties with Taiwan. I considered that\nTaiwan does engage in economic and other types of espionage. There are no\nindications in these instances that Taiwan was targeting U.S. citizens to provide\neconomic or other sensitive information. While Taiwan is a country that is friendly to the\nU.S., it could engage in espionage against U.S. interests. Friendly countries may have\nprofound disagreements with the U.S. or have engaged in espionage against U.S.\neconomic, scientific, or technical interests. A friendly relationship is not determinative,\nbut it makes it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S.\ncitizen through relatives or associates in that country. Taiwan is not a hostile country,\nnor are its interests inimical to the U.S. The U.S. and Taiwan are large democracies,\nenjoy good relations, and are trading partners. It is reasonable to consider that Taiwan\nwould not take any action to jeopardize its friendly position with the U.S. because of its\nneed for trade and defense assistance from the U.S. It would be considered an act\nunfriendly to the interest of the U.S. to coerce its citizens with relatives in the U.S. to\npressure their U.S. relatives to provide economic or other espionage information against\nthe interest of the U.S. Taiwan has cooperated with the U.S. in the investigation of\nespionage incidents with Taiwan. While none of the considerations by themselves\ndispose of the issue, they are all factors to be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s\nvulnerability to pressure or coercion from his family members in Taiwan. Because of his\nfrequent trips to Taiwan between January 2001 and January 2008, which included\ncontacts with his family members, the government has established that there is a\nheightened risk that Applicant will be targeted under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).\nIn deciding if Applicant has submitted evidence of mitigation, under AG \u00b6 8 (a), I\nmust consider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider if\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with his family members is not a basis to deny\nhim a security clearance; however, his burden of proof on mitigation requires more than\nstatements about the limited scope of his conversations with his three brothers. See\nISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). Applicant\u2019s three brothers have\n\n11\nnever worked for the Taiwanese government nor held a political position. They do not\nrely upon the Taiwan government for their income or retirement benefits. Applicant\nprovides no financial support to his brothers and relinquished all his rights to any\ninheritance he may have from his father\u2019s estate. His only financial interests are in the\nU.S., not Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s business trips to Taiwan ceased in 2003. He has voted in\nU.S. elections since he became a citizen in 1996. His children live in the U.S. Balancing\nthese factors against Taiwan\u2019s espionage activities and the lack of evidence that Taiwan\ntargets U.S. citizens for protected information, I find that Applicant would resolve any\nconflict in favor of the U.S. interests. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns as to his family contacts specified in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8a\nand 8b.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\nrequires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single item in\nisolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness. Applicant\u2019s brothers in Taiwan work in private industry, not for the\nTaiwanese government. They are not politically active. They do not depend upon the\ngovernment for income, even in their retirement.  Given their circumstances and\nApplicant\u2019s strong ties to the U.S., it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position to\nchoose between the interests of his family and the interest of the U.S. or be exploited,\npressured, or coerced because of his brothers in Taiwan.\nApplicant came to the U.S. more than 25 years ago, as a young man. He has\nlived most of his adult life in the U.S. His children, who are his closest family members,\nwere born in the U.S. and are being raised in the U.S. He came to the U.S. for an\nadvanced college education and remained. He has contributed to the country through\n\n12\nhis work and has achieved the American dream of financial success and home\nownership. His employer praises his work ethic and treasurers the unique skills and\ntalents he brings to the workplace. He enjoys his U.S. lifestyle and intends to remain in\nthe U.S. His contacts with his family members in Taiwan do not indicate a security risk\nnor does his past travel to Taiwan.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), on \nAugust 4, 2006. On August 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 30, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on \nthe administrative record. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR on September \n4, 2007.  On September 15, 2007, Department Counsel requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge in accordance with \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. Department Counsel \nwas prepared to proceed on November 20, 2007. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on November 27, 2007. The case was transferred to me on \nDecember 10, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 22, 2008, and I \nMarch 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on February 7, 2008. The government offered \nExhibits (Gov Ex) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and submitted four documents which were admitted as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A \u2013 D without objections. On February 13, 2008, Applicant submitted a 13-\npage document which is admitted as AE E without objection.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on February 19, 2008. The record closed on March 1, \n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nOn January 29, 2008, the Government submitted a Motion for Telephone \nTestimony. On February 1, 2008, I denied the request.  At hearing, the Government \nwithdrew their motion for telephone testimony and requested the record be left open \nuntil February 14, 2008, to allow them to submit an incident report.  Applicant did not \nobject. The Government had until February 14, 2008 to submit the additional document. \n(Tr at 8-9.) The Government was required to serve a copy of the document on the \nApplicant. Applicant had until March 1, 2008, to submit any additional comments or \nsuggestions pertaining to the additional document. On February 14, 2008, the \nGovernment submitted a JPAS Incident History, which was admitted as Gov 6. \nApplicant did not submit a response pertaining to Gov 6. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAdministrative notice is taken of General Order Number 1 (GO-1), Prohibited \nActivities for U.S. Department of Defense Personnel Assigned to the Multi-National \nCorps \u2013 Iraq (MNC-I) or present within the MNC-I Area of Responsibility (AOR), from \nHeadquarters Multi-National Corps \u2013 Iraq, dated February 12, 2005, a copy of which  \nwas admitted as Gov 5.      \n \n \nThe following sections are noted, in particular: \n \n \nPURPOSE: To identify conduct that is prejudicial to the maintenance of \n \ngood order and discipline to all forces assigned to the MNC-I or present \n \nwithin the MNC-I AOR. \n \n \nAPPLICABILITY: This General Order is applicable to all United States \n \nmilitary personnel, and to civilians serving with, employed by, or \n \naccompanying the Armed Forces of the United States, while assigned to \n \nthe MNC-I or while present in the MNC-I AOR except for personnel \n \nexpressly excluded under USCENTCOM GO-1A.

This General Order is not applicable to any personnel \n \nassigned to XVIII Airborne  Corps (Rear) or personnel located outside the \n \nUSCENTCOM AOR. \n \nSTATEMENT OF MILITARY PURPOSE AND NECESSITY: Current \noperations and deployments place United States Armed Forces into areas \nwhere local laws and customs prohibit or restrict certain activities that are \ngenerally permissible in western societies. Restrictions upon these \nactivities are essential to fostering US/host nation relations and combined \noperations of US and friendly forces. In addition, the high operational \ntempo combined with the hazardous duty faced by MNC-I soldiers and \nother US forces in the MNC-I AOR makes it necessary to restrict certain \nactivities in order to maintain good order and discipline and ensure optimal \nreadiness. \n \n2. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES: in accordance with and in addition to \nUSCENTCOM GO-1A, the following activities are prohibited: \n \n \na. Purchase, possession, use or sale of privately owned firearms, \nammunition, explosives, or the introduction of these items into the MNC-I \nAOR. \n \n \nc.

This \nrestriction also prohibits the introduction, possession, sale, transfer, \nmanufacture or consumption of any alcoholic beverage by military \npersonnel or civilians serving with, employed by, or accompanying the \nArmed Forces of the United States, while assigned to or under the \noperational control of the Commander, MNC-I and present for duty in \nKuwait or Iraq. This prohibition does not apply to personal hygiene items \n(like mouthwash) commercially available for sale by AAFES in the MNC-I \nAOR, nor does it apply to the use of alcohol for authorized religious \nceremonies. \n \n \ne. Introduction, possession, transfer, sale, creation or display of any \npornographic or sexually explicit photograph, videotapes, movie, drawing, \nbooks, magazine, or similar presentations. The prohibitions contained in \nthis subparagraph shall not apply to AFRTS broadcasts and commercial \nvideotapes distributed and/or displayed through AAFES or MWR outlets \nlocated within the USCENTCOM AOR. This prohibition shall also not \napply within the areas exclusively under the jurisdiction of the United \nStates, such as aboard United States vessels and aircraft. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nk. Taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies, except as \nnoted below: \n \n(3) No weapon, munitions, or military article of equipment obtained \nor acquired by any means other than official use may be retained \nfor personal use or shipped out of the AOR for personal retention or \ncontrol unless authorized by the Commander, MNC-1.  \n \n3. PUNITIVE ORDER: Paragraph 2 of this General Order is punitive. \nPersons subject to the UCMJ may be punished for violations of this \nGeneral Order. Civilians serving with, employed by, or accompanying the \nArmed Forces of the United States in the MNC-I AOR may face criminal \nprosecution or adverse administrative action for violation to this General \nOrder. \n \n4.

CONFISCATION OF OFFENDING ARTICLES: Items determined to \nviolate this General Order may be considered contraband and confiscated \nby command or law enforcement authorities if found under the control of \nMNC-I soldiers or within the MNC-I AOR. Before destruction of \ncontraband, Commanders or law enforcement personnel will coordinate \nwith their servicing judge advocate.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 30, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e and 1.f.   He denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b61.c, and 1.d. He \nalso commented that the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f was redundant with SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old technical writer/technical instructor employed by a \nDepartment of Defense contractor seeking to maintain a security clearance. He has \nworked for his current employer since November 2003. He is a high school graduate \nwith some college. From 1996 to 2002, he served on active duty in the United States \nArmy. He separated at the rank of E-4 with an honorable discharge. He was a Specialist \nin the satellite communications career field. He has held a security clearance since \n1996. He is married and has no children. (Tr at 4-6; Gov 1.)   \n \nAfter he separated from the Army, Applicant accepted a job with his current \nemployer in September 2003. As a contract employer, he was an electronic technician \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwho worked on the installation and operation and maintenance of satellite terminal and \nphone centers used by the troops to call home. Most of the phone centers were located \nat the military exchanges on various US military bases located in Iraq. (AE A; Gov 3.)  \n \nApplicant arrived in Iraq in November 2003. When he traveled from base to base, \nhe rode in various military supply convoys. He soon discovered that it was dangerous \ndriving around the country.  His employer provided a bright red truck that did not have \narmor. His job required him to drive around to various US military locations. Baghdad \nInternational Airport was his company\u2019s unofficial headquarters. (Tr at 30, 35-36.)   \n \nIn December 2003, Applicant decided that he needed to have a weapon for \npersonal protection due to the increasing insurgent attacks and convoy ambushes. \nSeveral contractors were kidnapped and killed. (Tr at 32; Gov 3 at 1.) Around that time, \nApplicant testified that a convoy commander, an Army Captain, would not allow \nApplicant to ride in his military convoy unless he had a weapon for self defense.  The \nconvoy commander gave him two AK-47 rifles that were seized in a raid earlier that day. \n(Tr at 40.)  Applicant previously had given the convoy commander a bottle of alcohol. \n(Tr at 40-41.) In a signed, sworn, statement dated April 16, 2005 (Gov 3), Applicant \nindicated the following: \n \nIn DEC03 I decided that I needed a weapon for protection and to be \n \nallowed to ride in Army convoys. I had been told by service personnel that \n \nI had to have a weapon to ride in the convoys. So I traded alcohol with \n \nU.S. Army personnel at War Eagle where I got two AK 47. I do not recall \n \nthe names of the individuals who I got weapons from. \n \nApplicant kept one rifle and gave the other rifle to a co-worker. He later traded \nalcohol for a semi-automatic pistol with a soldier from the 82nd Airborne (SP).  He later \ntraded alcohol for two AK-47 rifles with a US Marine. He gave the rifles to two co-\nworkers. In December 2004, he obtained another 9 mm handgun for another co-worker. \n(Gov 3.)  He received no formal training when he was provided the weapons. (Tr at 75.)    \n \nApplicant used alcohol to trade for weapons, ammunition and other needs such \nas armor for his vehicle. (Gov 4.) He also gave alcohol when he socialized with troops \nhe befriended. (Tr at 47.) He would purchase alcohol at the duty free shop located at \nthe Baghdad International Airport. (Gov 3 at 2.) He never contacted his supervisor or his \nemployer to inquire about purchasing weapons. He did contact them about providing \narmor for the company vehicle which his employer later provided. (Tr at 76, 97-100.)  \nHe had copies of Playboy and Penthouse magazines for his personal use. (Gov 3 at 2.)  \n \nApplicant states he never concealed the fact that he had weapons.  He kept the 9 \nmm pistol strapped to his flak vest in plain view.  He claims he was never questioned \nabout it. (Tr at 46.) When he purchased alcohol from the duty free shop at Baghdad \nInternational Airport, he often saw contractor personnel and military members \npurchasing alcohol from the shop.  He claims there was a widespread culture of drinking \nby the military. He was not aware that military members were forbidden to drink alcohol. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(Tr at 47; Gov 3 at 2.) No Army Air Force Exchange System (AAFES) facilities located \nin Iraq sold alcohol. (Tr at 86.) \n \nOn April 15, 2005, Applicant was traveling with a night time military convoy to a \nUS airbase located in Iraq.  At some point prior to the convoy\u2019s arrival, security at the \ngate was notified by the military that a civilian contractor who stated that he was an \nemployee of Kellogg, Brown, and Root (KBR) was in the convoy and that he was \ncarrying a 9mm automatic pistol.  When the convoy approached the security check \npoint, Applicant was asked if he had a weapon.  He said, \u201cYes\u201d.  He was subsequently \nsearched.  A pistol was removed from the holster that was mounted on Applicant\u2019s body \narmor.  The security officer asked Applicant if he had contraband, weapons, or sharp \nitems in the vehicle.  The incident report states that Applicant repeatedly stated that he \ndid not. A subsequent search of the vehicle revealed that Applicant had four 9 mm \nmagazines loaded with 9 mm ammunition; an AK-47 rifle; two AK-47 30 round \nmagazines loaded with 7.62 x 39 ammunition; a 12 inch knife; a global positioning \nsystem; a digital camera; one bottle of whiskey, one bottle of red wine; seven 16 ounce \ncans of beer; and Penthouse and Hustler magazines (amount unknown). (Gov 4.)  \n \nWhen security personnel asked Applicant why he chose to bring contraband (i.e. \npornographic material and alcohol) onto a US military installation. He replied that he \ntrades pornography and alcohol for weapons, ammunition, and other things he needs.  \nHe claimed that he got the pornography and alcohol from his coworkers. He was asked \nwhy he did not seek out weapons through legal channels such as the explosive \nordnance disposal (EOD) teams or area security managers.  He said he did not move in \nthose circles.  He was asked why he was the not following the rules of Combined Joint \nTask Force Seven (CJTF-7). He claimed that he was never briefed on them and he \nnever knew there were rules in the theater.  He claimed that he did not know alcohol \nwas prohibited.  At the end of the interrogation, Applicant disclosed the name of his \nemployer. It was discovered that he was not a KBR employee. (Gov 4.) The record is \nunclear as to whether Applicant actually told the convoy commander that he was a KBR \nemployee or whether it was a miscommunication.  Applicant testified that he never said \nhe was a KBR employee.  He wears his employee identification at all times. He did not \ndiscover that there was an issue regarding his identity until a few days after the incident \nwhen he talked to his supervisor. (Tr at 58-59; Answer to SOR.)     \n \nAfter the search, Applicant was allowed to return to his quarters while the \ninvestigation was pending. A few days later, he was contacted by a Marine Captain who \ntold him to pick up his items that were not considered contraband.  When he picked up \nthe items, he was informed that he could not remain in Iraq as of result of the illegal \ncontraband in his possession. He was told to clear the base and leave the country \nwithin 24 hours. Applicant took the first military flight to Kuwait and flew home \ncommercially that same day.  After returning to the United States, he was informed by \nhis supervisor that AAFES withdrew their letter of invitation which allowed him to work \nas a contractor in Iraq. (Gov 2; Answer to SOR.)  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant would hand out telephone cards to military personnel, civilians, and \ncontractors out of appreciation for what they did for him.  By way of example, he would \nhand out phone cards after he was allowed to travel with a convoy. He gave phone \ncards to employees who let him know when convoys were going out and for helping him \nget on the manifest.  He claims he never gave the phone card out as payment for being \non a convoy. (Gov 3.)  He spent a lot of time arranging to travel with military convoys. \n(Tr at 78-79.)  \n \nApplicant claims that he was never briefed by his employer, the military, or \ncontracted security personnel about the rules pertaining to weapons, alcohol, or \npornography in the area of operation, i.e. Iraq. The first time he learned about General \nOrder One was on April 15, 2005, when his vehicle was searched. He claims that he did \nnot use the contraband to buy favors. He did not think that his conduct was illegal. He \nfelt he needed the weapons to protect himself.  He was never arrested or charged with \nany crime while in Iraq and did not receive any disciplinary action from ITT Industries. In \nApril 2005, Applicant resigned from the contract. He never intends to return to Iraq as a \ncontractor due to the dangerous nature of the work. (Gov 2; Answer to SOR.) \n \nApplicant listed his position in Iraq in response to question 22 on his security \nclearance application, dated August 4, 2006, which asks \u201cHas any of the following \nhappened to you in the last 7 years \u2013 Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable \ncircumstances?\u201d (Gov 1.)  After learning the rules, he realizes that his conduct was \nwrong and never intends to engage in such activity again. (Gov 2). \n  \nThe Integrated Logisitics Support Manager where Applicant currently works \nstates Applicant has worked on his team for the past 15 months. He states that there is \nno task that Applicant has been assigned and completed that has not exceeded his \nexpectations. He interacts with him on a professional and a personal level and would \nnot hesitate to entrust him with the company\u2019s most sensitive materials. (AE C.)  The \nPrinciple Logistics Engineer has worked with Applicant since April 2006 and has dealt \nwith him on a professional and a social level. He has not observed any actions that \nwould lead him to believe that Applicant is a security risk. (AE B.)   \n \nThe company Facility Security Officer (FSO) states that she has known Applicant \nfor 2 \u00bd years.  She indicates Applicant handles classified information on a daily basis \nand is diligent about following security procedures. She is aware of the allegations of \npossessing a handgun and possession of pornographic material. He told her that he \nreceived the handgun from a U.S. solider and purchased the magazine at a local Post \nExchange in country. She did not state that she was aware Applicant provided alcohol \nto military members in exchange for other weapons. She believes these incidents have \nbeen blown out of proportion. (AE D.) It is also unclear whether the FSO was aware of \nthe prohibitions outlined in General Order 1 pertaining the contractors possessing \nweapons in IRAQ, the use of alcohol, or possessing materials that are considered \npornographic and/or sexually explicit within Iraq.    \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nDuring his active duty military service with the United States Army, Applicant \ndeployed to Guatemala, Honduras, and Okinawa. (Tr at 77; AE E at 4-13.) He was \nawarded a Good Conduct Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and two Army \nAchievement Medals while on active duty. (AE E.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThe government did not establish a prima facie case with respect to the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d.  There is insufficient evidence to support the \nallegation that Applicant misrepresented himself as a KBR employee when he traveled \nwith a military convoy to a United States military base in Iraq in 2005 as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c.  The incident statement prepared by contracted security personnel indicates they \nreceived a message from the military that an inbound convoy contained a civilian \ncontractor who said that he was a KBR employee and was carrying a 9 mm automatic \npistol. The incident statement is unsworn, unsigned, and contains hearsay. There is no \nadditional reliable evidence to support the premise that Applicant misrepresented \nhimself as a KBR employee while traveling with the convoy.  This information could \neasily have been a miscommunication from a third party rather than a deliberate false \nstatement made directly by the Applicant.   \n \n \nThere is nothing in the incident report that supports the premise that Applicant \ntold the security personnel at the entry control point to the military base that he was a \nKBR employee.  The report states at the end that Applicant stated he was not a KBR \nemployee and provided the name of his employer. The report also indicates that \nApplicant was not asked why he told the convoy commander that he was a KBR \nemployee.  The incident contains no substantial evidence that Applicant misrepresented \nhimself as a KBR employee to the convoy commander or to the security personnel at \nthe gate to the base.  Applicant believes there was some sort of misunderstanding.  His \nidentity was cleared up when AAFES personnel identified him. I find for Applicant with \nrespect the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s claims of ignorance of the prohibitions listed in General Order \nNumber 1 pertaining to the use of privately owned firearms, alcohol, and possession of \npornography/sexually explicit material in the AOR is not credible. With his six years of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nactive duty service, including several deployments outside the United States, it is \nreasonable to conclude that he is aware that while in another country certain customs \nand courtesies must be followed while in that country. He should also be aware that \ncommanders set certain rules for all personnel including military, civilian, and \ncontractors to follow while in the AOR. He claims he was never trained by his company \nor by the military on these policies. Aside from his own assertions, he provided no \ncorroborating evidence from his company and/or the U.S. military about the lack of \ntraining. \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s concern about needing a weapon for self defense is \nunderstandable, trading alcohol for weapons is a rather unorthodox manner of obtaining \nweapons. Prior to obtaining the weapons, Applicant neither contacted his supervisory \nchain to inquire about obtaining weapons for he and his co-workers, nor consulted the \nproper military channels to inquire about obtaining weapons for he and his co-workers. \nAt one point, he contacted his company to request armor for the company vehicles but \nnever submitted a request for weapons.  A reasonable person would assume that, as a \ncontractor, the proper way to inquire about and obtain weapons is through their \nemployer.  \n \n \nOf the disqualifying factors under the personal conduct guideline, Personal \nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b616(c) (credible adverse information in \nseveral adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under \nany other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information) applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s claims of ignorance pertaining to General Order 1 lacks \ncredibility. Neither he nor his co-workers were authorized to possess weapons. He was \nnot allowed to purchase and/or transfer alcohol to military personnel stationed in the \nAOR.   \n \n \nEven if Applicant truly was ignorant about the prohibitions listed in General Order \n1, he had a duty as a contractor working with the military to inquire about the customs \nand courtesies of the foreign country that he was working in and about the rules and \nstandards in the AOR that were set by the Commander. He should have been aware of \nthis based on his prior military experience and deployments. His conduct raises \nquestions about his judgment and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe purpose of General Order 1 is to prohibit conduct that is prejudicial to the \nmaintenance of good order and discipline of all forces assigned to MNC-I or present \nwithin the MNC-1 AOR.  Applicant claims that alcohol was legal in Iraq. There is nothing \nin the record evidence indicating whether alcohol was legal in Iraq.  However, this is \nirrelevant, because the standards to follow are the ones set by the geographic \ncommander for the AOR.   \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nJoint Publication 4-0, Doctrine of Logistic Support of Joint Operations, Chapter V, \nparagraph 13.b, dated 6 April 2000, states: \n \n \nAs a general rule, contractor personnel accompanying US forces should \n \nnot be armed. Regardless of prior military experience or reserve status, \n \ncontract personnel are not military personnel. Issuing weapons to \n \ncontractor personnel deployed in an uncertain or hostile environment can \n \ncloud their status, leaving  them open to being targeted as a combatant. \n \nAdditionally, unless specifically allowed by host nation law, SOFA \n \nprovision, or other international agreement, US Forces have no legal basis \n \nfor issuing arms to contractor personnel. Since contractor personnel are \n \nnot subject to command authority enforced by an internal system of penal \n \ndiscipline, commanders have no method of guaranteeing armed contractor \n \npersonnel will act in accordance with the law of war or host nation law.        \n \n \nThere are special limited cases where contractors may be issued personal \nweapons. In those cases, the issuance of such weapons must be authorized under \nprocedures approved by the geographic commander and comply with military \nregulations regarding firearms training and safe handling. (Joint Publication 4-0, chapter \nV, paragraph 13.b.)  While Applicant more than likely has never reviewed Joint \nPublication 4-0, the Joint Doctrine stresses the point that contractors are not armed \nunless under limited circumstances under procedures approved by the geographic \ncommander. It is reasonable to conclude that trading alcohol for weapons is not the \nprocedure established by the geographic commander.        \n \n \nThe allegations under Personal Conduct can be mitigated. Personal Conduct \nMitigating Condition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is the only mitigating condition that has the \npotential to apply.  I find that it does not.  Applicant\u2019s actions while deployed as a \ncontractor in Iraq were serious.  Once he was finally caught, he was ordered to leave \nthe country and AAFES withdrew their letter of invitation for him to work as a contractor \nin Iraq which reinforces the notion that his conduct is considered serious.  His conduct \nwas disruptive to the maintenance of good order and discipline of forces assigned to the \nAOR.  Considering his past military experience, he should have known that there were \nproper procedures in place to inquire about obtaining weapons.  He should have been \naware that trading weapons for alcohol was not the proper procedure for obtaining \nweapons. He should have been aware that the use of alcohol by the troops was \nprohibited. His conduct raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness and \nreliability.  He has not mitigated the concerns raised under personal conduct. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n12 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nmilitary record and the favorable recommendations of his current supervisors and co-\nworkers.  In some ways, his favorable military record is a double-edged sword. Given \nhis military experience, Applicant should have known there were orders issued that \nwould apply in the AOR. His claims of ignorance are less than credible. Applicant failed \nto mitigate the personal conduct concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \npersonal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRita C. O\u2019Brien, Esq.,  Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n  Applicant has had a history of overdue debts that have not been resolved.  Mitigation has\nnot been shown. Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 11, 2007 , the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Exhibit 1) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant\nand recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ndenied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated June 1. 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations (RSOR) (Exhibit 2). He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu\nof a hearing.\nOn June 20, 2007, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete\ncopy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was given the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A\nresponse was due by July 28, 2007, but no response to the FORM was filed. The case was assigned\nto another Administrative Judge on September 10, 2007, but it was reassigned to this Administrative\nJudge on September 14, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel offered eight documentary items (Exhibits 1-8), which have been\nadmitted without objection. Applicant offered no documentary evidence into the record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR contains eleven allegations, 1.a.,\nthrough 1.k., under Guideline F. In the FORM, Department Counsel included a Motion to Amend\nthe SOR. Specifically, the Government moves to delete allegation 1.b. from the SOR, as they\nreceived evidence that this debt had been resolved as of April 5, 2006. Through the FORM,\nApplicant received notice of this motion, and no objection was filed by Applicant. Allegation 1.b.\nhas now been stricken from the SOR.\nApplicant  has admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.k., with the exception of 1.d., which\nhe denies. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nSince this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to\nthe contents of the various documents that are found in the case file. After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the FORM,  and the\n\n3\nadmitted documents, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Additional\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 52 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Amended SOR lists 10 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.k, under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. These debts will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $650. In his RSOR\n(Item 3), Applicant admits this debt is owed, but he avers that he plans to have this debt \u201ccorrected\u201d\nby September 2007.  No evidence was introduced to show that this debt has been paid. I find that this\ndebt is still due and owing.\n1.b. As discussed above, this allegation has been deleted from the SOR.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $265. In Item 3,\nApplicant admits this debt is owed, but he avers that he plans to resolve this debt.  No evidence was\nintroduced to show that this debt has been paid. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $13,494. In Item\n3, Applicant denies that he owes this debt for an automobile that was repossessed in 2006.  He has\nfurnished no evidence to support his allegation that he does not owe this debt. Therefore, I find that\nthis debt is still due and owing.\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $34. In Item 3,\nApplicant admits this debt is owed, but he avers that he plans to resolve this debt.  No evidence was\nintroduced to show that this debt has been paid. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $35.  In Item 3,\nApplicant admits this debt is owed, but he avers that he plans to resolve this debt.  No evidence was\nintroduced to show that this debt has been paid. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,013.   In Item\n3, Applicant admits this debt is owed, but he indicates that he was advised by an attorney that, since\nthis debt was old and had been written off, he should simply take no action and wait for the debt to\nbe removed from his credit report. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,023. In Item 3,\nApplicant admits this debt is owed, but he indicates that he was advised by an attorney that, since\nthis debt was old and had been written off, he should simply take no action and wait for the debt to\nbe removed from his credit report. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,941. In Item 3,\nApplicant admits this debt is owed, but he indicates that he was advised by an attorney that, since\nthis debt was old and had been written off, he should simply take no action and wait for the debt to\n\n4\nbe removed from his credit report. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $100. In Item 3,\nApplicant admits this debt is owed, but he avers that he plans to resolve this debt.  No evidence was\nintroduced to show that this debt has been paid. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,565. In Item\n3, Applicant admits this debt is owed, but he indicates that he was advised by an attorney that, since\nthis debt was old and had been written off, he should simply take no action and wait for the debt to\nbe removed from his credit report. I find that this debt is still due and owing.\nApplicant indicates that his financial problems began when he purchased a home in 2001,\nwhich combined with his wife\u2019s ill health, caused him to become overextended. He claimed that\nbecause of his wife\u2019s infirmities, including being wheelchair bound which was why they had to\npurchase a new home, and her medical bills, his finances continued to deteriorate. However,\nApplicant submitted no evidence that he will be able to manage his finances better in the future. \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\n\n5\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise\ndoubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden\nof persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \"the clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance. This the\nApplicant has not done.\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines F: \n\n6\nThe Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly\nestablishes Applicant's long history of indebtedness, and there is no evidence that Applicant has\nresolved these overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F in the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, I conclude both DC 19 (a) and (c) apply, because of Appellant\u2019s \u201chistory of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d and his apparent \u201cunwillingness to satisfy his debts.\u201d \nIn considering the Mitigating Conditions (MC) 20, MC (b) could be argued to apply since\npart of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties occurred because of his wife\u2019s illness. However, no evidence\nwas introduced to establish that  Applicant  \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Also MC\n(e) does not apply because while Applicant has indicated that he does dispute his largest debt,\n$13,494 in allegation 1.d., he has provided no evidence to substantiate the basis of the dispute. \nUntil Applicant makes a good-faith effort and can prove that he has resolved his overdue\ndebts, and he can establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will\ncontinue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 26, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 3, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan\nMetz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that: (a) Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness had resulted from circumstances beyond her control, a divorce; (b) she had paid off,\nbeen making payments on, or been otherwise disputing her outstanding debts; and (c) her military\nservice record had been excellent, and she had never been reprimanded for wrongdoing.  Applicant\u2019s\narguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nAn applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has\nnegative security implications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The\nDirective's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which\nare of security concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an\napplicant's security eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR\nCase No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had significant delinquent debts and\nwas still in the process of resolving her financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  Furthermore, the Judge\u2019s challenged findings are\nsustainable.\nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\n\n3\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge considered the evidence which Applicant\nreferenced in her appeal brief and reasonably explained why that evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility renders her an unsuitable candidate for a security\nclearance. Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 26 July 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\nfinancial considerations.  Applicant submitted an undated answer, and requested a hearing. The case\n1\n\n2\nwas assigned to me 11 September 2007, and I convened a hearing 23 October 2007. DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr.) 31 October 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAt hearing, I left the record open to allow Applicant to provide any proof of the payments\nshe claimed to have made during her testimony. Applicant responded in a timely fashion, but the\ndocuments she submitted were mostly unresponsive to the reason the record was left open, consisting\nof character references and military service awards. Accordingly, I have only considered her the\nportion of her post-hearing submission delineated by Department Counsel as documents 12-15 (A.E.\nD).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the financial allegations of the SOR. She is a 31-year-old order clerk for\na defense contractor since April 2004. She has previously held a clearance, but her current status is\nunclear.\nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling nearly $25,000. Each of these debts is\ndocumented in Applicant\u2019s credit reports. Three debts (SOR 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d.) are each less than\n$200. Applicant claims to have paid the debt at SOR 1.b., but has provided no corroboration of that\nclaim. She paid the debt at SOR 1.a. in August 2007 and the debt at SOR 1.d in September 2007\n(A.E. B). The remaining three debts (SOR 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f.) are each more than $7,000. Of those\nthree, Applicant claims that the debt at SOR 1.c. to a furniture company is not hers. She and her\nhusband had a joint account with the furniture company when they bought, and paid for (A.E. B),\nfurniture for their house. Applicant asserts that he husband bought furniture on that account after\nthey separated, but is unable to corroborate that claim.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems dating back to 2000. She ascribes her financial difficulties\nto her separation and divorce. Several of their joint accounts became delinquent because Applicant\ncould not keep up with the payments, and her ex-husband filed for bankruptcy (A.E. C) and had\nhimself discharged from his liability for those accounts. However, the debt at SOR 1.e. is for a time\nshare Applicant and her husband bought after they divorced. While she has submitted some proof\nof payment on the account (A.E. D), she has not produced proof of her claim that she satisfied the\ndebt. Similarly, the debt at SOR 1.f. is the deficiency balance on a voluntary repossession of\nApplicant\u2019s automobile. Again, she has provided some proof of past payments (A.E. D), but no\ncorroboration of her claim that the debt has been resolved.\nApplicant has undertaken some efforts to have her credit reports updated to remove accounts\nthat are not hers (A.E. A), although she has had a difficult time getting them to respond to her. She\nhas set aside $800, and continues to set aside about $100 per pay period, to pay any debts that the\ncredit bureaus confirm are hers. Her ex-husband owes her substantial arrears in child support. She\nhas been unable to compel his compliance in the past, and currently lacks the funds to pursue the\narrears directly. She is now pursuing her remedies through the cognizant state agency.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt; \u00a9) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n4\nunlikely to recur . . . \n3\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines list factors to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect nearly $25,000 of delinquent debt\nacquired during her marriage.  While her divorce undoubtedly contributed to her financial\n3\ndifficulties, she has compounded them by purchasing a time share with her ex-husband, and her\ninability to effectively pursue her rights under the divorce decree, both regarding his agreement to\ntake a certain amount of the joint debt and his obligation to pay child support.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed they appear to be ongoing. Applicant has\n4\n\n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.\u00a9) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\nestablished that her debts were only partially due to circumstances beyond her control, and she has\nnot acted entirely responsibly in addressing her debts.  There is no evidence that she has sought\n5\ncredit counseling, or otherwise brought the problem under control.  Applicant has taken few\n6\nverifiable steps to address her debts.  The two debts she has resolved are small, and were resolved\n7\nonly recently. While she may have a legitimate dispute on the furniture debt, the two other large\ndebts are clearly her responsibility, and she has produced no evidence to corroborate her claims that\nshe had resolved them. Further, the record contains little to suggest that Applicant would be able to\nbecome or remain financially stable in the future. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

I make the following findings: Applicant is 41-year-old flight operations analyst for a federal contractor (Tr. 42, 44). He served in the U.S. Navy from November 1985 to November 2005 and retired as a petty officer first class. He was unemployed from the date of his retirement until he began working for his current employer in November 2006 (GX 1 at 8; Tr. 44).

On the same \nday, Applicant requested another extension of time to obtain and submit additional \ndocuments, and I granted a final extension until March 3, 2008.  He submitted no \nadditional documents.  Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX H and I is attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Applicant\u2019s requests for extensions and my responses \nare attached as HX II.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 23, \n2008. The record closed on March 3, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.f.  His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is 41-year-old flight operations analyst for a federal contractor (Tr. 42, \n44). He served in the U.S. Navy from November 1985 to November 2005 and retired as \na petty officer first class. He was unemployed from the date of his retirement until he \nbegan working for his current employer in November 2006 (GX 1 at 8; Tr. 44). During \nhis Navy service he received numerous decorations and commendations (AX G). He \nreceived a clearance while in the Navy and has retained it in his current employment. \nHe was married in April 1986 and has a 12-year-old son. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations since January 2007 rate him as a \u201chigh \ncontributor\u201d who is \u201cwilling to go the extra mile.\u201d This rating is the second highest on a \nscale of five ratings (AX F).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began around 1999.  He was assigned to shore \nduty and began working part-time jobs off duty.  Relying on the additional income, he \nbegan spending more, and he overextended himself (Tr. 68, 74).  He was transferred to \na mobile training team involving extensive travel, which forced him to quit his second job \n(Tr. 69).  He counted on his wife to handle the bills while he was traveling (Tr. 70).  He \nwas unemployed for a year after he retired and lived with his parents while seeking \nemployment (Tr. 70-71). After he was hired by his current employer, he lived in an \napartment away from his family and incurred the expenses of maintaining two homes \n(Tr. 72).  His wife had medical problems that were only partially covered by TRICARE \n(Tr. 72).  He became aware that his financial problems were a security concern when he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in July 2006 (GX 10).  He responded to \nDOHA interrogatories about his financial situation in May 2007 (GX 3). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant enrolled in a training course for government \nemployment.  He dropped out of the course because he did not find it worthwhile.  The \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a arose when he stopped making tuition payments (Tr. 48).  \nThe debt has been settled (AX I Encl 1; Tr. 49-50). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b arose when Applicant cosigned a car loan for his \nmother. His mother made payments for about 18 months, began suffering medical \nproblems, stopped making payments in May 2002, and voluntarily surrendered the car \nin January 2003.  The car was repossessed and sold. The amount of the debt alleged in \nthe SOR is the amount due on the loan, not counting the proceeds of the sale.  \nApplicant contacted the creditor and was informed that they were negotiating with his \nmother to resolve the deficiency on the debt (Tr. 53).  He contacted the creditor again \nshortly before retiring from the Navy but was unable to obtain any documentation \nshowing how much the creditor received from the sale of the car (Tr. 53-54). At the \nhearing, he admitted the debt but questioned the amount (Tr. 52).  After the hearing, he \nlearned the entry had been deleted from his credit report at the request of the creditor \n(AX I at 2 and Encl 2).  The record does not reflect the reason for the deletion. \n \n \nApplicant testified at the hearing that the creditor for the credit card debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c could not find any record of this account, which was about eight years old.  \nAfter the hearing, he provided a written statement that he had negotiated settlement of \nthe debt for one-half of the balance and payments of $266.87 for four months beginning \non February 14, 2008 (AX I at 1). Applicant did not produce documentation of the \nsettlement agreement or any payments made. \n \n \nApplicant paid off the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d in May of 2007, using \nback pay for a disability rating (Tr. 57; GX 7 at 6; AX I Encl 3).  He testified he did not \npay off the debt sooner because it was \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d (Tr. 59). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was an unsecured personal loan.  It also was paid \noff from Applicant\u2019s back pay for disability (Tr. 61; AX B). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f arose from a purchase of a computer in 1999.  \nApplicant testified the computer was for his son (Tr. 62), but that testimony seems \nimplausible because his son would have been only four years old in 1999. The account \nwas placed for collection in 2004.  Applicant disputed the credit report entry, but the \ncredit bureau informed him in June 2007 that it was correctly reported (AX B). He has \nsent letters requesting a payment plan, but the debt remains unresolved (Tr. 63).   \n \n \nThe credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g became delinquent in 2000.  At the \nhearing, Applicant testified his wife had a credit card from this creditor but he did not.  \nHe did not know if he was listed as a joint account holder (Tr. 64).  After the hearing, he \npresented evidence the account is paid (AX I Encl 4). \n \n \nApplicant testified the creditor for the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h could \nnot find any record of the debt (Tr. 66). After the hearing, Applicant resolved the debt by \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntransferring a reduced balance to a new \u201cpre-approved\u201d credit card account, which is \nnow listed as current (AX I at Encl 5 and Encl 6). \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debt for telephone services alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i.  \nApplicant testified he contacted the collection agency, who had no information in their \nrecords (Tr. 67).  After the hearing, he contacted the original creditor and asked why the \ndebt was no longer on his credit reports. Applicant stated he was informed by the \ncreditor\u2019s representative that the account probably was satisfied (AX I at 2).   \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling from the Navy as part of his preparation \nfor retirement.  He has not enrolled in any credit counseling since his retirement (Tr. 83). \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nin the table below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount\nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nTuition \n$545 \nPaid \nAX C; AX I Encl 1 \n1.b \nCar repossession $35,263 Amount disputed; deleted \nfrom credit report; status is \nunclear \nAX I Encl 2 \n1.c \nCredit card \n$2,025 \nPayment plan beginning \nFeb 08; no documentation \nAX I at 1; AX B \n1.d \nCredit card \n$371 \nPaid \nGX 7 at 6;  \nAX I Encl 3 \n1.e \nLoan \n$2,630 \nPaid \nAX B \n1.f \nComputer \n$4,565 \nUnresolved \nAX I at 1-2 \n1.g \nCredit card \n$1,673 \nPaid \nAX I Encl 4 \n1.h \nCredit card \n$1,147 \nResolved \nAX I at 2;  \nAX I Encl 5 \n1.i \nTelephone \n$140 \nDisputed \nAX I at 2 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a budget analysis as of January 14, 2008, reflecting monthly \nnet income of $4,721, including his military retirement and disability pay.  His monthly \nexpenses are $2,431 and his monthly debt payments are $1,377, leaving a net monthly \nremainder of $913. The computation of the net monthly remainder assumes minimum \nmonthly payments on all credit card balances. The listed debts do not include the \ninstallment payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The total outstanding balance \non all debts is about $21,966, including $9,329 in car loans and credit card balances \ntotaling more than $10,000. (AX E). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.  Id. at 527. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@  Applicant has not resolved the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f. He admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b in his answer to the SOR and at \nthe hearing. The deletion of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b from his credit report is inconclusive, \nbecause the reason for the deletion is not reflected in the record. He has failed to \ndocument the payment plan for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c or provide proof of any payments, \neven though the first payment was due before the record closed.  He has been unable \nto negotiate a settlement of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f.  I conclude AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is Aindebtedness \ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of \nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.@  \nApplicant\u2019s spending habits while he was on shore duty and working two jobs suggest \nfrivolous or irresponsible spending, satisfying the first prong. However, he has stated his \nintent to pay his debts and has demonstrated his intent by resolving some of his debts. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised.   \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@  \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises this disqualifying condition. \n \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  Applicant\u2019s unwise overspending \nwhile he was working two jobs raises this disqualifying condition. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established, because the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.c, and 1.f, are not yet resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not \nestablished because of Applicant\u2019s multiple delinquent debts. The evidence regarding \nthe third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is inconclusive, because it is too soon to determine \nwhether Applicant will revert to the irresponsible spending habits he exhibited while in \nthe Navy. His current income and expenses have him living on the financial edge, with \nlittle flexibility to meet unexpected expenses.  Because none of the first three prongs are \nestablished, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established.  Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s illness that \ncaused her to default on her car payments, his year of unemployment, the expense of \nmaintaining two households, and his wife\u2019s recent medical problems were conditions \nbeyond his control. However, many of his delinquent debts preceded these events.  \nAlthough Applicant contacted the creditor regarding the car repossession, his overall \nattitude toward his delinquent debts was, in his words, \u201cout of sight, out of mind.\u201d It was \nonly after he realized his security clearance was in jeopardy that he began aggressively \nresolving his debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  It \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control.  However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control.  Applicant received a \ntype of financial counseling before he retired from the Navy, but it was more a review of \nhis financial status than a program designed to change spending habits.  The debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f are unresolved, and there is no evidence that Applicant has \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncomplied with the payment plan for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts followed several years of inaction and indifference, and they were \ntriggered by his realization that his clearance was in jeopardy.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nnot established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@  AG \u00b6 20(e).  While \nApplicant has not provided \u201cdocumented proof\u201d to support his disputing of the debts in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.i, his testimony and post-hearing submission are \u201cevidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  The dispute regarding SOR \u00b6 1.f was decided against \nhim. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is established, but only for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant served his country for more than 20 years and held a security \nclearance for about eight years, apparently without incident.  However, he overextended \nhimself while on active duty, and he still is on the financial edge. Whether he will \n\n \n9 \n \n \nexercise financial discipline and resolve his remaining debts cannot be determined. He \nhas not yet established a sound financial track record.   \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 32 years old, married but about to be divorced from his wife. Applicant served eight years, six months in the U.S. Marines, being honorably discharged in December 2003. He obtained the rank of E-5 in four years. He was unemployed from then until February 2005. At that time he found a job in his specialty, non-destructive aircraft testing, with a defense contractor. He has been gainfully employed with that company since then. Applicant is the first high school graduate in his family. He obtained his degree while in foster care from the ages of 15 to 19. He was in foster care not through any fault or action on his part, but because his parents were not able to care for him and his siblings. Applicant presented himself at the hearing in an articulate and professional manner. (Tr. 19-25, 47, 69-76; Exhibits 1, D, E) Applicant's supervisors, including the person who hired him into the company for which he currently works, regards him as a professional and ethical worker.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On June 8, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on  December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on July 7, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The\ncase was assigned to me on August 15, 2007.  On November 15, 2007, I convened a hearing to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted\ninto evidence.  I left the record open until December 6th to allow Applicant to submit additional\ndocuments for consideration.  He submitted them, and the Government had no objection.  I marked\nthem as Exhibits G-L and admitted them into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non November 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to all of  the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 32 years old, married but about to be divorced from his wife.  Applicant served\neight years, six months in the U.S. Marines, being honorably discharged in December 2003.  He\nobtained the rank of E-5 in four years.  He was unemployed from then until February 2005.  At that\ntime he found a job in his specialty, non-destructive aircraft testing, with a defense contractor.  He\nhas been gainfully employed with that company since then.  Applicant is the first high school\ngraduate in his family.  He obtained his degree while in foster care from the ages of 15 to 19.  He was\nin foster care not through any fault or action on his part, but because his parents were not able to care\nfor him and his siblings.  Applicant presented himself at the hearing in an articulate and professional\nmanner. (Tr. 19-25, 47, 69-76; Exhibits 1, D, E)\nApplicant's supervisors, including the person who hired him into the company for which he\ncurrently works, regards him as a professional and ethical worker.  They are very satisfied with\nApplicant's work product and work ethic.  His character references write that Applicant is a very\nknowledgeable test technician, and that he has received recognition from his managers for his job\nperformance. (Tr. 13, 14; Exhibits A-C, E)\nApplicant has no credit cards except his company credit card, used for travel and work\npurposes.  He pays that balance in full monthly.  He pays his current monthly bills on time.  He gave\nhis wife the responsibility to pay all other bills, but does not know which ones are paid or not paid.\nHe traveled from August 4th until 10 days before the hearing.  When he returned home he found his\n\n3\nwife had left him, taking almost everything from their rented house.  Applicant will now be\nresponsible for paying his own bills.  He acknowledges his 13 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.\nHe admitted none had been paid as of the date of the hearing.  His budget plan, submitted as an\nexhibit, shows he intends to repay his delinquent debts at the rate of $500 monthly.  He did not repay\nthese debts previously because his wife was expensive to support.  Now he will not have that\nfinancial expense.  His plan is to repay his delinquent debts by January 2009.  He consulted with a\ndebt consolidation agency he found on the internet, but has not paid them any money yet.  Applicant\nhas a lease on the house he occupies.  After his wife leaves him, he will obtain one or two\nroommates to help split the rental cost, and increase his ability to repay his debts. (Tr. 24, 26, 41-46,\n56; Exhibits 2-5, F)\nApplicant incurred his delinquent debts while unemployed from December 2003 to February\n2005, and while on active duty.  These debts total nearly $24,000.  Six debts total $630.  Applicant\nrepaid four of those debts after the hearing and before December 6th.  The debt in Subparagraph 1.f\nwas paid in 2005, according to the creditor, and the debt in Subparagraph 1.b was paid on May 23,\n2007, according to the creditor.  Those debts are SOR subparagraphs 1.b (gas company for apartment\nheating, $69), 1.c (cable television service, $104), 1.f (credit card used at PX while in Kuwait on\nactive duty, $136), 1.k (video rental, $140), 1.l (auto insurance with company which insures his car\nnow, $115), and 1.m (water bill for apartment at last duty station, $66).  Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and\n1.m are debts for utilities services to the same apartment at Applicant's last military duty station.  The\nremaining seven delinquent debts total $22,700:  Subparagraph 1.a (carpet repair at apartment he and\nhis wife rented and Applicant disputes charge, $599); 1.d (a credit card, $7,417); 1.e. (tire\nreplacement for car, $918); 1.g (department store credit card, $612); 1.h (car loan, $11,623); 1.i\n(overdraft charges on a checking account, $1,155); and, 1.j (court costs for driving class not taken,\n$446).  These seven will be paid out of the $500 debt repayment amount in his budget. (Tr. 28-39;\nExhibits 2-5, F-L)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\n\n4\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\n\n5\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations:  Applicant incurred debts which he allowed to become\ndelinquent for a variety of reasons.  He did not repay them in the past two years because his wife was\nin charge of paying the bills and he did not monitor those payments.  And Applicant found his wife\nwas expensive to support.  He did not pay attention to his financial obligations, in part also, because\nhe traveled for his job and was not home.\nThe disqualifying conditions applicable are Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n\u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations).  Applicant had an obligation to repay the debts, and forgot to do so, or did not give\nthem enough attention while working and getting married during the past two years.\nApplicant's situation has now changed.  He admits his responsibility to repay the debts, and\ncommits to doing so.  His wife left him, and now he is in charge of paying his debts, i.e., actually\nwriting the checks or making electronic payments.  He demonstrated his commitment to get the debts\npaid by repaying six delinquent debts in a three-week time period after the hearing.  His budget in\nExhibit F shows a commitment to spending $500 monthly to repay the remaining debts.  His planned\ndate of January 2009 for repaying all of them may be ambitious absent a greater money repayment\namount, but it shows Applicant is focused on the problem and has a plan.  Furthermore, some of the\ndebts were incurred during a 14-month period of unemployment Applicant endured after being\nhonorably discharged from the Marines, having completed eight years and six months of service.\nApplicant repaid $630 of debt in a three-week period, so he knows what to do to repay debts and\nhow to do it.  He took the initiative to repay them.\nThe Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions applicable are \u00b620.b (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), and  \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\n\n6\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nThere are nine adjudicative factors to apply.  All nine are relevant to Applicant\u2019s past\nfinancial situation.  $24,000 is a lot of debt for person to have.  Most of the debts go back to 2003\nand some date farther back.  But his period of unemployment contributed to most of them.  However,\nsince he became employed in 2005, he has not incurred significant debt.  There does not appear to\nbe a pattern of incurring significant debt and then failing to repay it over many years.  Applicant was\nin his twenties when the debts were incurred.  He recently contacted a debt consolidation service,\nbut has not engaged it yet.  He repaid $630 of debt on his own efforts, constituting almost half of the\nnumber of allegations in the SOR.  Applicant's motivation for spending these monies was not\nfrivolous or irresponsible, but was part of obtaining goods and services.  His automobile debt is his\nlargest debt, and he should be able to reestablish an installment payment plan with the lender.  \nApplicant spoke at the hearing of having a responsible job which he does well, and therefore,\nhe should be considered responsible enough now to be trusted to repay his debts, especially because\nhe will not have the distraction of his wife's expenses.  He makes a persuasive argument, especially\nbecause he is articulate and credible.  He persevered through foster care and a disrupted family to\nobtain a high school diploma, spent eight years in the U.S. Marines,  obtaining the rank of E-5\n(Sergeant) in four years which is an accomplishment of note.  Applicant has demonstrated through\nhis life his dedication to duty and his commitment to accomplishing his stated goals.  His\ncommitment to repay his debts is, therefore, believable and persuasive.\nBased on the totality of the evidence, I conclude the Financial Considerations security\nconcern for Applicant.  I also conclude the \"whole person\" concept for Applicant based on his work\nand military performance history, the factors under that concept, and his eloquent presentation at the\nhearing.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n7\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 24-year-old systems engineer. Security concerns are raised by his marijuana\nuse and related personal conduct. His last use of marijuana was in August 2005 while overseas on\nvacation. Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns because (1) his marijuana use is not\nrecent, (2) he intends not to abuse any drugs in the future, (3) his history of marijuana use is\nrelatively minor and insignificant, and (4) his related personal conduct no longer makes him\nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Clearance is granted.\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on July 10, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline H for drug\ninvolvement based on marijuana use and Guideline E for personal conduct related to his marijuana\nuse.     \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn August 3, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on November 14, 2007, and the transcript was received on November 26, 2007.\n   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and\n2.b. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence. \nApplicant is a 24-year-old systems engineer who is employed by a company engaged in\ndefense contracting. He has not married and he has no children. This is his first post-college job, and\nhe started working for the company in September 2005. He is seeking to retain a security clearance.\nApplicant admits to past marijuana use approximately five or six times, the most recent of\nwhich was August 2005. He used it twice in the U.S., once in high school and once in college. He\nused it three times on trips to Amsterdam in 2002 and 2005. \nDuring 1997\u20132001, Applicant attended high school. He graduated high school in May 2001,\nand started college that fall. He earned a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in systems engineering in May\n2005. \nApplicant worked as a college intern for a defense contractor from May 2003 to about May\n2005. For this employment, he completed a security-clearance application in June 2003 when he was\n\n3\nabout 20 years old. He reported in the application that he had used marijuana on two occasions\nduring the period of October 1999 to March 2003 (Exhibit 1). Based on his application, a\nbackground investigation was conducted, which included an interview with Applicant in June 2004.\nIn his written statement, he admitted the previously disclosed marijuana use and characterized it as\nexperimentation (Exhibit 2 at p. 4). Also, he disclosed that he used marijuana twice while on\nvacation in Amsterdam in 2002. He explained he did not disclose his 2002 marijuana use in his\nsecurity-clearance application because he understood that it was legal to use marijuana in\nAmsterdam. He further indicated that he did not intend to use marijuana again based on the effects\nof using it in Amsterdam.\nIn April 2005, Applicant completed an employment application for his current employer\n(Exhibit 3). Although he was offered a full-time position with the company that he interned with,\nhe was unhappy with them and wanted to relocate to another area of the country. In the application,\nhe indicated that he had been granted a secret-level security clearance in August 2004. Along with\ncompleting the application, he also completed a pre-employment drug screening consent form\nwherein he agreed to submit to drug testing (Exhibit 3 at p. 7). \nApplicant took the summer off after graduating from college to travel around the United\nStates and Europe. His travels led him back to Amsterdam in August 2005 when he used marijuana\nfor the last time with two acquaintances.\nHe started his current employment on September 12, 2005. According to company\u2019s\npersonnel security office, Applicant had been in contact with that office before his start date\nconcerning his marijuana use in Amsterdam (Exhibit A). Several days after starting work, he\ncompleted another security-clearance application, apparently to upgrade from secret to a top-secret\nclearance (Exhibit 4). In response to the relevant question, he disclosed that he used marijuana five\ntimes and made the following additional comments:\nExperimentation, used a couple of times in the US and a couple of times in\nAmsterdam. Also, although it is legal to smoke in Amsterdam, I should note that I\ndid regrettably smoke once on my last visit to Amsterdam on 8/10/05 (Exhibit 5 at\np. 43 of 47).\nThe agency issued interrogatories to Applicant, to which he responded in April 2007 (Exhibit\n5). He indicated he had used marijuana a total of six times from October 1999 to August 2005. He\ndenied possessing any drugs or drug-related paraphernalia. He denied any intention to use marijuana\nin the future. \nApplicant is performing well in his job as a systems engineer (Exhibits A, B, and C). Indeed,\nin May 2006, he was nominated for participation in a company engineering leadership development\nprogram (Exhibit C). In a memorandum supporting the nomination, Applicant\u2019s then manager\ndescribed him as \u201can extremely bright, energetic and conscientious worker\u201d with \u201cenormous\npotential that needs to be developed and exploited\u201d (Exhibit C at pp. 1\u20132). Although he was not\nselected for the program based on this nomination, he has since been selected for it. Applicant\nintends to further his education and career goals by obtaining an MBA. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n4\nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant addressed the circumstances surrounding his marijuana\nuse. Concerning the August 2005 use in Amsterdam, he considers it a \u201cstupid decision\u201d (R. 73). He\nis now headed in a different direction in his life with a focus on professional success. He does not\nassociate with the two acquaintances from the Amsterdam incident. He has two roommates and, as\nfar as he knows, neither roommate is involved with marijuana. Finally, Applicant submitted a signed\nstatement wherein he agreed that he would not use, traffic, or distribute any controlled substance\nregardless of any local codes or laws permitting this behavior, and he acknowledged that his failure\nto comply with his statement will result with automatic revocation of any security clearance held by\nhim (Exhibit D). Also, he agreed to submit to professional evaluation or counseling as well as drug\ntesting.  \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 17\u201318 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 17. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cany drug abuse.\u201d See generally U.S. Department of State Background Note: The Netherlands, in\n16\nwhich it discusses the country\u2019s domestic drug policy, available online at the State Department\u2019s Web site (the Dutch\nOpium Act punishes possession, commercial distribution, production, import, and export of all illicit drugs, however,\ndrug use is not an offense).  \n See DC 7 is \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d\n17\n5\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  a security concern may exist based on illegal drug\n14\nuse or misuse of a prescription drug. Either \u201ccan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  \n15\nHere, based on the record evidence, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s history of\nmarijuana use. Starting in October 1999 (when he was 16 years old) and ending in August 2005\n(when he was 22 years old), Applicant used marijuana five or six times. Plainly, his use of marijuana\nin the U.S. was illegal and supports a conclusion that Applicant engaged in drug abuse.  In addition,\n16\nApplicant aggravated the situation by using marijuana in 2005 after he submitted a security-clearance\napplication in 2003 and after a clearance was granted in 2004.  The concern here is that Applicant\u2019s\n17\nhistory of illegal marijuana use is indicative of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, and it calls\ninto question his willingness to follow laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe four mitigating conditions under Guideline H have been considered and two apply in his\nfavor. His marijuana used ceased more than two years ago, which is not recent. And it took place a\n\n MC 1 is \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n18\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n MC 2 is \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from drug-using\n19\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d \n ISCR Case No. 97-0803 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 1998) (See administrative judge\u2019s decision for underlying facts\n20\nand circumstances).\n ISCR Case No. 98-0675 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 1999) (See administrative judge\u2019s decision for underlying facts\n21\nand circumstances).\n ISCR 98-0611 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 1999) (See administrative judge\u2019s decision and remand decision for\n22\nunderlying facts and circumstances).\n ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004) (See administrative judge\u2019s decision for underlying facts\n23\nand circumstances).\n6\nmere five or six times, which is infrequent. Both these circumstances support a conclusion that\nfurther marijuana use is unlikely to recur. Accordingly, MC 1  applies in his favor. \n18\nIn addition, Applicant has demonstrated his intent not to use marijuana in the future based\non the following: (1) he has abstained from marijuana use for more than two years; (2) his marijuana\nuse was infrequent; (3) he has affirmatively stated his intention to abstain from marijuana use as it\nis inconsistent with his professional plans and goals; (4) he signed a statement of intent to abstain\nwith automatic revocation if he used drugs in the future; and (5) he has been candid and truthful with\nthe government by disclosing his marijuana use. Given these circumstances, MC 2  applies in his\n19\nfavor. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s marijuana use raises a security concern, it needs to be put in\nperspective. The agency appeal board has  affirmed the granting of security clearances in cases\ninvolving applicants with long-term or significant histories of marijuana involvement. For example,\nin 1998, the appeal board affirmed a favorable decision for a 41-year-old applicant with a 24-year\nhistory of marijuana use, who had used marijuana during his military service, and who had used\nmarijuana for several years after being granted a security clearance.  Then in 1999, the appeal board\n20\naffirmed a favorable decision for a 37-year-old applicant who started using marijuana at a party in\n1996 and used marijuana one to two times daily for three months in 1998.  Then again in 1999, the\n21\nappeal board affirmed a favorable decision for a 28-year-old applicant who smoked marijuana nine\nmonths before the record closed, who smoked marijuana over a ten-year period, and who smoked\nmarijuana while working as a security professional in violation of his employer\u2019s policy.  In 2004,\n22\nthe appeal board reversed an unfavorable decision against a 50-year-old applicant with a 28-year\nhistory of regular, although occasional, marijuana use culminating in his arrest for drug-related\ncriminal conduct.  So compared with the facts of these cases, Applicant\u2019s youthful and infrequent\n23\nmarijuana use is relatively minor or insignificant when viewed in the big picture. \n \nApplicant has not used marijuana since August 2005, more than two years ago, and he is no\nlonger in the environment where his marijuana use occurred. At the hearing, I found Applicant to\nbe sincere, honest, and credible, and I found him to be embarrassed and humiliated for being called\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n24\n Revised Guidelines at p. 10.\n25\n DC 5 is \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\n26\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal\nin that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or\npressure by the foreign security service or intelligence service or other group. \n MC 5 is \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\n27\nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d \n7\non the carpet for his conduct. He candidly acknowledged his 2005 marijuana use was a stupid\ndecision; indeed, he was quite foolish. He now understands and fully appreciates that any illegal or\nimproper drug involvement is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. To sum up, I am\npersuaded that his marijuana use is a thing of the past and is unlikely to recur.  \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements, credible adverse\n24\ninformation that may not be enough to support action under any other guideline, and other personal\nconduct of concern. In particular, a security concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations [that may] raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability\nto protect classified information.\u201d25\nThe issues here have, somewhat, been discussed under Guideline H. Nevertheless, the record\nevidence raises a security concern under Guideline E as well based on his marijuana use in August\n2005 when he was in Amsterdam. It took place after he submitted a security-clearance application\nin 2003 and had been granted a clearance in 2004. Also, it took place after he executed a job\napplication in 2005 with a defense contractor and in doing so agreed to a pre-employment drug\nscreen. Taken together, these circumstances fall within the meaning of DC 5  of the guideline,\n26\nbecause engaging in such conduct, as a clearance holder, while in a foreign country created a\npotential to vulnerability. \nIn mitigation, Applicant has reduced or eliminated any potential to vulnerability within the\nmeaning of MC 5  of the guideline. He has done so by abstaining from marijuana use for more than\n27\ntwo years and by demonstrating his intent not to use marijuana in the future as discussed above. In\naddition, he has reduced or eliminated any potential to vulnerability by disclosing his history of\nmarijuana use. Indeed, he revealed his August 2005 marijuana use to his employer before his start\ndate with the company. It is possible that the government would have never discovered his August\n2005 marijuana use but for his self-reporting and he should be credited for having the integrity to\ndo so. He recognizes his actions were stupid and now understands and appreciates that any illegal\nor improper drug involvement is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. His youth and\ninexperience, at age 22 a few months out of college, likely influenced his poor judgment. The\noutcome here may be different if Applicant was a 45-year-old man with a clearance for many years.\nGiven all the circumstances, the likelihood of similar personal conduct is assessed as remote. \n\n8\nTo conclude, after weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has explained,\nextenuated, or mitigated the drug involvement and personal conduct security concerns. And\nApplicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly, both guidelines are decided for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline H:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

O\u2019Brien, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge:\nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that\nApplicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under the\nDrug Involvement, Personal Conduct, and Criminal Conduct adjudicative guidelines.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 11,\n2006. On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J,\n(Criminal Conduct). DOHA\u2019s action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 18, 2007. In his answer,\nApplicant requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The\nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 31, 2008.  The\nMarch 28, 2008\n\n2\nFORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 10.  A copy of the FORM was\nprovided to Applicant on January 31, 2008, with instructions to submit any additional\ninformation and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on\nFebruary 5, 2008. He filed additional information within the required time period.  On\nMarch 5, 2008, the case was assigned to me for a decision.\n \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H,\nDrug Involvement, four allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal\nConduct, and six allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline J, Criminal\nConduct. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted, with explanations, three allegations under\nGuideline H. He admitted in part, with explanation, one Guideline H allegation, and he\ndenied one Guideline H allegation, with explanation.  He admitted, with explanation,\nthree allegations under Guideline E, and he denied in part, with explanation, one\nallegation under Guideline E.  He admitted all six allegations under Guideline J, with\nexplanations. (Item 3.)  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nApplicant is 45 years old, married, and employed by a defense contractor. He\nhas held a security clearance since 1997.  (Item 4.)\nThe SOR alleged disqualifying conduct under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. On\nabout November 25, 2003, when he was 41 years old, Applicant was charged with\nPossession of Marijuana.  On about May 10, 2004, he was convicted of Possession of\nMarijuana and sentenced to 30 days (suspended), fined $50.00, and assessed $140.00\nin court costs.  His driver\u2019s license was also suspended.  (Item 7 at 6; Item 10.)\nOn about September 2, 1986, Applicant was charged with the felony offense of\nPossession of Marijuana With Intent to Distribute after police seized a marijuana plant\nhe was growing in his backyard. He was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of\nPossession of Marijuana, sentenced to 30 days (suspended), and fined $100.  (Item 6\nat 3-4; Item 9 at 2.)\nIn about 1985 or 1986, Applicant was charged with Possession of Marijuana.\nThe Possession of Marijuana charge was dismissed because the evidence was lost.\n(Item 6 at 3.)\nIn signed, sworn statement to an authorized investigator in April 1996, Applicant\nreported he purchased and used marijuana from about 1979, when he was a freshman\nin high school, until about 1990.  He reported using marijuana two to three times\nweekly.  He also reported that during the five year period from 1985 to 1990, he used\ncocaine about twice a year when he was at parties and it was offered to him.  (Item 6 at\n2-3.)\nApplicant voluntarily reported his use of marijuana and cocaine in the signed,\nsworn statement made to an authorized investigator on April 25, 1996.  In his answer to\nthe SOR, he denied using cocaine and characterized the SOR allegation of his cocaine\nuse as \u201cfalse information.\u201d In his answer to the SOR, he also stated he had stopped\n\n3\nusing marijuana in 1986.  In his response to DOHA interrogatories, dated June 25,\n2007, Applicant stated he had used cocaine only once in the early 1980s.  (Item 3; Item\n6; Item 8 at 2.) \nThe SOR also alleged additional disqualifying conduct under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct. On or about November 22, 1980, Applicant was charged and\nconvicted of Larceny when he was caught stealing gasoline.  He was fined $100 and\nreceived a period of unsupervised probation.  (Item 6 at 4.)\nIn October 1981, Applicant was charged with Assault. He was convicted,\nrequired to pay his victim\u2019s medical bills, and placed on supervised probation for one\nyear.  (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 4.)\nIn about August 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with a \u201chit and run\u201d\nfollowing a traffic accident. In January 1993, the charge was reduced to Reckless\nDriving.  Applicant was sentenced to pay a fine, and his driver\u2019s license was restricted\nfor 90 days.  (Item 7 at 6.)\nIn about 1985 or 1986, at the time he was charged with Possession of Marijuana,\nApplicant was also charged and convicted of Drinking in Public.  He was sentenced to\npay a fine. (Item 6 at 3.)\nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on August 11,\n2006. Question 23 a on the SF-86 reads as follows: \u201cYour Police Record a.  Have you\never been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\u201d Applicant responded\n\u201cno\u201d to Question 23 a and failed to disclose that he had been charged with Possession\nof Marijuana With Intent to Distribute, a felony offense.  (Item 4; Item 6; Item 9.)\nQuestion 23 d on the SF-86 reads: Your Police Record d. Have you ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 23 d and failed to disclose that he had been\ncharged with or convicted of Possession of Marijuana on three occasions and with\nDrinking in Public on one occasion. (Item 4; Item 6; Item 7.)\nWhen he completed his SF-86, Applicant signed and dated a statement certifying\nthe truthfulness of his answers.  The statement that Applicant signed and certified reads\nas follows:\nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are\ntrue, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and\nbelief and are made in good faith. I understand that a\nknowing and willful false statement on this form can be\npunished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See section\n1001 of title 18, United States Code.)\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he thought he was obligated to report\non his SF-86 only criminal activity or drug and alcohol charges and convictions\noccurring in the last ten years. (Answer to SOR.)  \n\n4\nApplicant was sent a series of Interrogatories Concerning Drugs by an authorized\nrepresentative of the U.S. Government. Applicant was asked to respond to the following\nquestion: \u201c1. Have you used any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to\ninclude LSD or PCP) and/or any Cannabis (to include marijuana and hashish),\nexcept prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d Applicant responded to the\nInterrogatories with sworn and notarized statements dated May 3, 2007 and June 25,\n2007. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question about illegal drug use. However, he listed only\nmarijuana use and listed his frequency of use as \u201ca few times\u201d from \u201c1982 to 1985.\u201d  He\nstated that the quantity of his use was \u201ca couple of drags off a joint each time.\u201d  He\nfailed to list the marijuana use he reported in a signed sworn statement in April 1996 as\noccurring from 1979 to 1990, sometimes as frequently as two to three times weekly.  He\nalso failed to list cocaine use from 1985 to 1990 as reported to an authorized\ninvestigator in April 1996.  (Item 6; Item 7.)\nThe Interrogatories Concerning Drugs also asked Applicant to identify when he\nstopped using illegal substances.  In response, Applicant answered: \u201c1985 (only used\nmarijuana).\u201d This statement was not consistent with his earlier sworn statement that he\nhad used marijuana from 1979 to 1990 and had used cocaine twice yearly from 1985 to\n1990. (Item 6; Item 7.)\nApplicant signed and notarized his answers to the interrogatories, stating that\nthey were true and correct to his best knowledge and belief. (Item 7; Item 8.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\nDC 25(a) reads:\u201dany drug use.\u201d  DC 25(c) reads: \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\n1\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H,  Drug Involvement\nAn individual\u2019s use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug raises\nquestions of reliability and trustworthiness because drug use or misuse can impair\njudgment and raise questions about the person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24.  Guideline H defines drugs as mood\nand behavior altering substances. . . . Drugs include: (1) Drugs, materials, and other\nchemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24(a)(1)\nand \u00b6 24(a)(2).  The Guideline further defines drug abuse as the illegal use of drug or\nuse of a legal drug in an manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nGuideline H, \u00b6 24(b).\nApplicant admitted using marijuana and cocaine, illegal drugs, with varying\nfrequency, from about 1979 to 1990.  His most recent conviction of possession of\nmarijuana occurred in 2004. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC)\n25(a) and  (DC) 25(c) of Guideline H.    \n1\n\nSpecific examples of demonstrated intent that might apply under MC26(b) are as follows: (1) disassociation\n2\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) A signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. \n6\nSeveral Mitigating Conditions (MC) under Guideline H might be applicable to\nApplicant\u2019s case. If the drug abuse behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then MC 26(a)\nmight apply.  If Applicant intended not to abuse drugs in the future and demonstrated\nthat intent in one of the four ways specified in the Guideline, then MC 26(b) might\napply.   Additionally, drug abuse that is of security concern can be mitigated under MC\n2\n26(d) by satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but\nnot limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse,\nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\nThe record shows that Applicant admitted to cocaine use from 1985 to 1990,\nalthough he later denied cocaine use. His denial contradicted his sworn testimony to an\nauthorized investigator and lacked credibility. He admitted his marijuana use began in\nabout 1979 and continued intermittently to 2003. Thus, while much of his marijuana and\ncocaine use occurred in the past, his 2004 conviction for marijuana possession is\nrecent, and Applicant provided no credible evidence to corroborate his assertion that he\nno longer uses either drug and has no intent to use them in the future. Applicant failed\nto provide evidence he had satisfactorily completed a prescribed drug treatment\nprogram. His recent conviction for marijuana possession raises concerns about his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. None of the Guideline H MCs\napply to Applicant\u2019s drug use.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuideline E, \u00b6 15.   \nApplicant completed and signed a SF-86 on August 11, 2006. In response to\nQuestion 23 a,  he denied ever being charged with or convicted of any felony offense.\nIn response to Question 23 d, he denied  he had ever been charged with offenses\nrelated to alcohol or drugs.  In a signed sworn statement to an authorized investigator in\n1996, Applicant had admitted a felony offense and provided additional evidence of drug\nand alcohol offenses. Through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence, the\nGovernment established a prima facie case that Applicant deliberately falsified his\nanswers to Question 23 a and 23 d on the SF-86. The burden of proof thus shifted to\nApplicant to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s allegations.  \n\n7\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he though he was obliged to report\nonly felonies and drug and alcohol offenses that had occurred in the ten years prior to\nthe time he completed his August 11, 2006 SF-86. The relevant questions ask if an\napplicant had ever been charged or convicted of a felony or ever charged or convicted\nof offenses related to alcohol and drugs.  At the time he completed his SF-86, Applicant\nhad held a security clearance for at least 10 years. His assertions that he\nmisunderstood the questions lack credibility.    \nApplicant was asked to respond to Interrogatories Concerning Drugs.  While, in\nhis responses, he admitted illegal drug use, he listed only his marijuana use, and further\nstated that he used marijuana only a few times from 1982 to 1985. He stated that he\nstopped using illegal substances in 1985, and further stated he had only used\nmarijuana. He failed to list the marijuana use he had reported in a signed, sworn\nstatement to an authorized investigator in April 1996 as occurring from 1979 to 1990,\nsometimes as frequently as two to three times a week.  He also failed to list cocaine use\nfrom 1985 to 1990 as reported to the authorized investigator in April 1996. \nUnder Guideline E, a security concern is raised by an individual\u2019s deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities. Guideline E, \u00b6 16(a).  Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct also raises security\nconcerns under Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 16(b), and 16 (e)(1).  DC\n16(b) reads as follows: deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative. DC 16(e)(1) reads as follows: personal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \nTwo Guideline E mitigating conditions (MC) might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s\nconduct.  Pursuant to MC 17(a),  personal conduct security concerns might be mitigated\nif the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.  Pursuant to MC 17(e), personal\nconduct security concerns might be mitigated if the individual has taken positive steps to\nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant provided no credible evidence to mitigate his failure to disclose his\nfelony charge and his offenses related to drug and alcohol. Applicant was a mature\nadult when he failed to disclose his felony charge, his drug and alcohol charges,  the\nkinds of drugs he used, and the duration and frequency of his use. Although he knew, or\nshould have known, the importance of telling the truth to the Government, he had\nreason to attempt to conceal this derogatory information about his trustworthiness.  His\nassertions that his falsifications occurred by mistake because he did not read the\nquestions carefully were not credible. He did not make good-faith efforts to correct his\nomissions, concealment, or falsifications before being confronted with the facts, and he\ndid not take positive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to exploitation,\n\n8\nmanipulation, or duress caused by his concealment of this derogatory information\nrelating to his lack of trustworthiness.  I conclude that MC 17(a) and MC 17(e) do not\napply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government\u2019s concern under the Criminal Conduct revised adjudicative\nguideline is that a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Criminal conduct also raises\ndoubts about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  Guideline J, \u00b6 30.\nTwo conditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\nand DC 31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nThe record in this case shows that Applicant was charged with felony Possession\nof Marijuana With Intent to Distribute in 1986.  In 1985 or 1986 and in 2003, he was\ncharged with possession of marijuana.  He admitted purchasing and using marijuana\nfrom 1979 to 1990.  He also admitted using cocaine about twice a year from 1985 to\n1990.  His deliberate falsifications in his answers to Questions 23 a and 23 d on his SF-\n86 and his deliberate falsifications in response to Interrogatories Concerning Drugs also\nconstitute criminal activity under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  In addition to his drug-related\ncriminal conduct, Applicant was charged with larceny (1980), assault (1981), hit and run\n(1992), and drinking in public (1985). Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal activity raises\nsecurity concerns under Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 31(a) and 31(c) of Guideline J.\nTwo mitigating conditions under Guideline J might apply to the facts of\nApplicant\u2019s case.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under\nMitigating Condition (MC) 32(a) if he provided credible evidence to show that so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Applicant\u2019s criminal activity is\nrecent and raises concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He\nprovided no credible evidence to substantiate a conclusion that the conduct is unlikely\nto recur.  Accordingly, I conclude MC 32(a) is inapplicable. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under MC 32(d) if he\nprovided evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage\nof time without  recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nApplicant failed to show that  sufficient time had passed to reasonably conclude his\ncriminal activity had ceased and would not be repeated in the future.  Accordingly, I\nconclude the evidence fails to show successful rehabilitation and  MC 32(d) does not\napply.\n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish recent drug use and\ncriminal activity. The record evidence also supports a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\nfalsifications on his SF-86, dated August 11, 2006, and his falsification of his responses\nto interrogatories were deliberate, raising serious concerns about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant has failed to demonstrate that he is not a\nsecurity risk.\nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states\nthat an administrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust\nconsider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have\nconsidered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the\nwhole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that he has failed to demonstrate that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n____________________________\nJOAN CATON ANTHONY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on September 21,\n2005. On September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct) for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 15, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 2, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 9, 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on December 14, 2007, and I received the case\nassignment on December 19, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 19,\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n2\n2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 10, 2008. The government\noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through I, without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 22, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 2.c under Guideline\nE, alleging Applicant falsified his answer to a Government investigator\u2019s question about\nan arrest for driving while intoxicated (DUI).  The motion also added Paragraph 3, with\nthree subparagraphs, under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), alleging Applicant\nused alcohol in the commission of the criminal conduct alleged in Paragraph 1,\ncontinued to consume alcohol, and did not currently attend Alcoholics Anonymous.\nApplicant had no objection to the amendments, and I granted the motion.  Applicant\nthen answered the amendments on the record. (Tr. 9)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 2, 2007, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6 1 and \u00b6 2 of the SOR, with explanations.  He admitted the\nallegations contained in the amendments.  He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 48 years old, unmarried, and a military veteran.  He served on active\nduty from 1978 to 1984.  Applicant works as a structural technician for a defense\ncontractor.  He also serves in the National Guard, and his duty is as an aircraft\ntechnician. (Tr. 12-19; Exhibits 1, 2)\nIn March 1981, while on active military duty, Applicant struck the wall of his\nbarracks with his fist, putting a hole in it.  He also used \u201cprovoking\u201d words.  A Special\nCourt-Martial found him guilty of both allegations, and sentenced him to hard labor\nwithout confinement for one month, restriction to base for 10 days, and forfeiture of\n$100 of his pay.  This incident arose when Applicant drank alcohol at a barracks party.\n(Tr. 23, 24; Answer)\nIn April 1981, Applicant received non-judicial punishment under the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice (NJP) for violating the 10 day restriction of his court-martial\npunishment.  His commander imposed punishment of a suspended reduction in grade,\nforfeiture of $100 of pay for two months, and 30 days of correctional custody (15 days of\nwhich were suspended). (Tr. 24; Answer)\n\n3\nApplicant was arrested three times between 1983 and 2000 for DUI.  The first\narrest occurred while he was on active military duty in February 1983. Applicant\nreceived a NJP for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.   The second offense\noccurred on January 1, 1985.  The charge was reduced to reckless driving, and he was\nsentenced to 90 days in jail (time served), 90 days attendance at an alcohol information\nschool, and required to pay a fine.  The latest DUI arrest was November 14, 2000. He\nwas found guilty of DUI on November 15, 2000, and fined $675.  He paid the fine in full\nby December 2000. (Tr. 22, 27; Answer)\nApplicant completed his SCA on September 21, 2005.  In answer to Question 23\nD, concerning any charges or convictions relating to alcohol-related offenses, Applicant\nanswered, \u201cno.\u201d  Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his January 1985 and\nNovember 2000, DUI arrests.  Also, during an interview with a Government investigator\non July 25, 2006, Applicant stated he was arrested in November 2000, only for having\nan open alcohol container, not for DUI.  Applicant did not disclose his November 2000,\narrest and conviction for DUI to the investigator.  Applicant claims he did not want his\nDUI arrests revealed to his fellow employees or supervisors because the information\nthat was typed into the SCA was exposed to public view on the desk of the typist.  He\nclaims he was confused about the 2000 DUI arrest when the investigator asked him\nabout it, and for that reason he did not fully disclose the details of the arrest. (Tr. 27, 28,\n31-37; Answer; Exhibits 1, 3, 4)\nApplicant abstained from alcohol consumption from 1985 until 2000.  He\nresumed drinking alcohol and got his 2000 DUI at that time.  Applicant attended\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings from 1985 until 1987.  He started drinking alcohol\nwhen he was 16 years old.  He continues to drink a 12-pack of beer on weekends at his\nhome when he is alone.  He starts drinking Friday nights and continues until Sunday\nafternoon.  His latest drinking was the weekend before the hearing.  He admits he has a\n\u201cslight\u201d alcohol problem.  Applicant told the Government investigator in July 2005, that\ndrinking alcohol makes him sleepy, and he considers himself intoxicated after drinking\nthree beers. Applicant claims he now controls his drinking, and is tapering off from\nalcohol.  He claims he does not drink and drive at present on the weekends when he\ndrinks alcohol. (Tr. 20-23, 26, 27, 42; Exhibits 2, 4)\nApplicant submitted copies of his DD 214, Honorable Discharge Certificates,\nproof of employment and longevity from his employer, a 2007 certificate of\nachievement, and a sheriff\u2019s certificate of no criminal record from 2005. (Exhibits A to I)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of\nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very\n\n5\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and might be disqualifying (DC)\nare contained in \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses).  Applicant\nhas three DUI offenses, and a Special Court-Martial conviction for actions resulting from\nalcohol consumption.  He received NJP punishment in April 1981 for violating the\nrestriction portion of his court-martial punishment.\nThe Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable are \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement).  Applicant\u2019s DUI\noffenses occurred more than seven years ago, and the earliest ones were in 1983 and\n1985.  His drinking occurs at his residence on weekends, and he does not drink and\ndrive on those occasions.  His successful rehabilitation includes the passage of years of\ntime without any recurrence of the DUI, and a good employment record.  These factors\noutweigh the earlier offenses.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nUnder the facts of this case, DC \u00b616.a (involving deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, or determine trustworthiness), and \u00b616.b (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, or other official government representative) apply.\nApplicant admitted he did not disclose his DUI arrests in Question 23 of the SCA,\nbecause he did not want his co-workers or supervisors to know about his past actions.\nHe admitted he did not disclose to the Government investigator his 2000 DUI arrest and\nconviction.  His explanation of confusion is not persuasive or credible.\n\n6\nI considered the MC in AG \u00b6 17.  In view of Applicant\u2019s admissions of deliberate\nwithholding of information for his personal reasons, I decided that none of the MC apply.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set forth\nin AG \u00b6 21:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe DC applicable to Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption pattern and history are\ncontained in \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent), and \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to\nthe point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).  Applicant has three DUI incidents in his life,\nthough they did occur years ago.  He was court-martialled for actions at a barracks\nparty in 1981 which involved punching a wall, and using provoking words (as defined\nunder the UCMJ), all actions which fit within the general terms of \u201cfighting, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern.\u201d  All of these incidents occurred at least seven and\nno more than 26 years ago, so they are attenuated.  However, Applicant continues to\ndrink regularly a 12-pack of beer on weekends while alone in his residence,.  He told the\nGovernment investigator he is intoxicated after three beers.  This pattern is \u201chabitual\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The most serious items of concern\n\n7\nin this case are Applicant\u2019s regular consumption of alcohol, although he has not had any\nDUI arrests since 2000.  However, he drinks every weekend.  Based on his life\nexperiences, he should know better than to indulge in the behavior which resulted in\nthree DUIs in the past 26 years, and a court-martial conviction for disorderly conduct, to\nuse a general characterization of his 1981 incident.  He voluntarily drinks his 12-pack on\nthe weekends.  He voluntarily and knowingly failed to disclose his DUI arrests on his\nSCA, and then misled the Government investigator when questioned about the 2000\narrest.  His personal interest was the motivation for both types of conduct, creating\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Based on his history, it is very\nlikely his drinking will continue, and his reasons for falsifying his SCA will remain unless\nhe overcomes his own personal concerns about disclosing the information requested by\nthe Government.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his personal\nconduct and alcohol consumption.  I conclude these security concerns against\nApplicant, along with the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  I conclude Applicant did mitigate the\ncriminal conduct security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 10, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\n\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided upon the written record.  On September 28, 2007, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious\nand contrary to law because the Judge only partially quoted a statement made by Applicant in Item\n5 of the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material in his findings of fact.  The Board does not find this\nargument persuasive.\nA Judge has broad discretion in how to write a security clearance decision subject to the legal\nconstraints of the Directive and basic concepts of due process.  See e.g., 03-07245 at 4 (App. Bd.\nMay 20, 2005).  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence\nunless he specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3,\n1997).  The Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR\nCase No. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 1992).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge reasonably considered the evidence as a whole, including Item 5, and that his material\nfindings of security concern are sustainable.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After\nth\nthe government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nestablish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nand whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10950 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2007).\nThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 05-11134 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07183 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJun. 26, 2007).\nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe personal conduct allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and reasonably explained why the evidence\n\n3\nwhich Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline E is\nsustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRay T. Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s credibility is extremely suspect, as he has not been truthful or candid with\ninformation that he furnished to the United States Government in a Security Clearance Application\n(SCAs), regarding his past criminal conduct. Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, denied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated June 15, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn July 10, 2007, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete\ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was given the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A\nresponse was due on August 17, 2007. Applicant did not submit any additional evidence. The case\nwas assigned to this Administrative Judge on September 20, 2007.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Items 1-5). No\ndocuments were offered by Applicant.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)  of the Directive. The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b.\nunder Guideline E. Applicant admitted SOR allegation 1.b., and he denied 1.a.. The admitted\nallegation is incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and FORM, and upon due consideration of that\nevidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe furnished untruthful information to the Government about criminal conduct that was committed\nby Applicant in 2006.  \n1.a.  Applicant completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance Application (SCA) on June 23,\n2006 (Item 1).\nQuestion #23 of the SCA asks, In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with,\nor convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or  e above . . .  For this item, report\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise stricken from\nthe record.\u201d Applicant  answered \u201cNo.\u201d The Government has alleged that Applicant knowingly and\n\n3\nwillfully failed to disclose that information that will be discussed under 1.b., below.\n1.b.   On Jan 3, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault and Battery on a\nFamily Member. Applicant pled Nolo Contendere, but he was found guilty. He was sentenced to two\nyears probation. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $400, and to enroll in and complete a Domestic\nViolence program.\nApplicant avers that he has completed his probation under this conviction. Interrogatory\nresponses, submitted and signed by Applicant on April 23, 2007, (Item 5) include a letter dated\nAugust 9, 2006, to the judge who presided over Applicant\u2019s case. The letter states that Applicant\n\u201chas successfully completed probation.\u201d\nBy failing to list his 2006 arrest and conviction, Applicant clearly did not furnish complete\nand truthful information to the Government on the SCA that he completed on June 23, 2006. In his\nresponse to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant avers that he did not knowingly falsify a material fact on\nthe SCA, but rather he states that it was a misunderstanding, because he believed that once he\ncompleted a domestic violence program the charges would be expunged. \nI am not persuaded that Applicant\u2019s failure to list his criminal conduct on the SCA was an\ninnocent misunderstanding for two reasons. First, Question #24 specifically asks him to list arrests,\ncharges and convictions, even if the case had been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record. So\nthe fact that Applicant  believed the case had been expunged should not have prevented him from\nlisting it on the SCA. Secondly, and even more significantly, in Item 5, response to question 2.a.,\nApplicant admitted that he intentionally omitted listing the criminal offense\u201d because I needed  a job\nand I did felt (sic)embarrassed about it and did not want anyone to know because I was afraid I\nwould not be granted a clearance.\u201d\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n\n4\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of drug usage, alcohol abuse and criminal conduct,\nand that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant knowingly furnished to\nthe Government untruthful, incomplete information, regarding his past criminal conduct, in a SCA,\nexecuted on June 23, 2006. \n\n5\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to\nour nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts or fails to furnish\nrelevant information to the Government, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless\npossesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I\nconclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest information to the\nGovernment.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 16,\n(a) applies because Applicant deliberately provided false and  misleading information to the\nGovernment in a SCA.   No Mitigating Condition applies under this Guideline.  As a result of the\nmisinformation that Applicant  provided to the Government, his conduct exhibits questionable\njudgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\n        \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline E: AGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 9, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable finding under Guideline E is not at issue on appeal.\n1\n2\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 7, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\n \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give adequate weight to the mitigating evidence, and the decision is \u201cunfair\u201d because he is\na responsible person and did not breach workplace security.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had a significant number of\ndelinquent debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3,\n2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He found in favor of Applicant under Guideline E.\nHowever, he reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s other security concerns.  The Board does not review\na case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United\nStates v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines,\nInc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  An applicant with good or exemplary job\nperformance may engage in conduct that has negative security implications.  The Guidelines set forth\nin the Directive address a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are a\nsecurity concern to the government and require a whole-person analysis to determine an applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is by its very nature not confined to the workplace.  See,\n\n3\ne.g. ISCR Case No. 03-19006 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2005).

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 7, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on March 13,\n2006. On November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on January 4, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on January 31, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 7, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on March 6, 2008, in\n\n2\nSan Diego, California. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex) 1 through 6, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and his wife also\ntestified on his behalf. He submitted Exhibits A through K, which were admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on March  14, 2008. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted all of the SOR with some explanations, primarily\nwith allegation 2.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 30 years old. He is married, and he and his wife have two children.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 13 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.m., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. As discussed above, in his RSOR, Applicant admitted that all\nof these debts remain overdue and unpaid. During his testimony, Applicant also\nadmitted that all of the debts were still due and owing with the exception of 1.e. All of\nthe debts will be reviewed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $307,\nand it remains unpaid. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $50, and\nit remains unpaid. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $867,\nand it remains unpaid.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $41, and\nit remains unpaid. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,560.\nApplicant testified that this debt has been rolled into a credit card and he is making\nregular payments on this card. I find that while this debt is still owed, Applicant is now\nconsistently making payments on it and it is not an overdue debt.\n\n3\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $260,\nand it remains unpaid. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,360,\nand it remains unpaid. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,505,\nand it remains unpaid. \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $867,\nand it remains unpaid. \n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,395,\nand it remains unpaid. \n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $294,\nand it remains unpaid. \n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $103,\nand it remains unpaid\n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $975,\nand it remains unpaid. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties result in part because his income is limited,\nApplicant has never consulted with any debt relief consulting company to try to help him\nresolve his debts, nor has he made payments on any of these overdue debts listed in\nthe SOR, even though some of these debts are for extremely small amounts, including\n$50 for 1.b., $41 for 1.d., and $103 for 1.l. \nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed SCA on March 13, 2006 (Exhibit 1). Question\n28.a. asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as\n1.a. through 1.m.\nApplicant credibly testified that he was not trying to mislead the Government, and\nthat he had misunderstood the question. He believed that the question was asking for\ndebts that had arisen over the last seven years preceding the date he completed the\nSCA, and since his debts were older than seven years, he did not believe he had to\ninclude these debts in his answer. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the previous question, he did identify that he had\nundergone a garnishment and a repossession, both putting the Government on notice\n\n4\nthat he had experienced financial problems in the past. If he was trying to mislead the\nGovernment, it is less likely that he would have included this information in his SCA. \nApplicant explained that his previous financial difficulties were incurred when he\nand his wife had their first child, and he was not ready to assume all of the financial\nresponsibilities required. He has also had significant medical bill because his wife\nsuffers form Multiple Sclerosis, which also limits her ability for employment.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified about her illness and also she verified that her husband\nwas the primary breadwinner, not only for their immediate family, but also for his\nparents, who share a residence with them.  \nFinally, Applicant  offered into evidence three letters from individuals who know\nApplicant in his professional life (Ex A). They spoke in extremely laudatory terms of him\nas an \u201cethical, competent and dependable person.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to satisfy his\ndebts, and his long history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies as Applicant has failed to\nresolve any of his overdue debts, even those for which the amount is not significant.\nWhile his wife\u2019s illness which lead to some of his financial problems was largely beyond\nhis control, by his failing to make any attempt to consult with a credit counseling service\nor to pay off even the smallest of debts, I can not find that he has acted in a responsible\nmanner.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SCA that he executed on March\n13, 2006. Applicant identified no debts that were over 180 days overdue in the last\nseven years prior to his completing the SCA, when clearly he should have identified all\nof the debts listed on the SOR. However, Applicant testified credibly that he\nmisunderstood the question. By Applicant answering \u201cYes\u201d to the previous question and\nlisting a garnishment and a repossession, he did put the Government on notice that he\nhad some financial difficulties. I find that Applicant did not intend to mislead the\nGovernment.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against\nApplicant. I therefore, resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, his failure to resolve the overdue debts, even the small ones, and his failure\nto make any attempt to receive financial counseling, I find that the record evidence\nleaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 20, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 30, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the Government had not met its burden of production under two of the Guideline E\nallegations; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the Guidelines E and J mitigating conditions was\nunsupported by record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was unsupported\nby record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact:  Applicant is an electronics laboratory\ntechnician for a Defense contractor.  He is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps.  He married his first\nwife in 1986, divorcing her 18 months later.  They have a daughter from the marriage (Daughter),\nof whom the wife was awarded custody in the divorce settlement.  Applicant is currently married to\nhis second wife, with whom he has two children.\nIn 1986 Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  In November 1998, Daughter was\nvisiting Applicant at his home.  Applicant denied Daughter\u2019s request for a friend to visit her, which\nApplicant believed upset Daughter.  Applicant stated that Daughter and his previous wife did not get\nalong with his current wife.  Applicant\u2019s memory of the events is \u201cnot completely clear.\u201d  Decision\nat 3.   However, shortly after her visit with Applicant, Daughter \u201ccalled Applicant and told him she\nknew what he had done-that he touched her in the wrong places.  He denied any wrongdoing and told\nher he was sorry she was upset.  The police report indicates that [Daughter] told the police about this\nalleged conduct and that Applicant also improperly touched his other daughter at the same time.  It\nalso shows that, at around 1:30 a.m., with the police on the telephone line, [Daughter] called\nApplicant . . . The report states that Applicant denied improperly touching his younger daughter and\nthat he admitted his conduct with [Daughter].  Applicant, however, denies that this conduct occurred\nwith [Daughter].\u201d  Id.  \nThe police arrested Applicant on November 16, 1998, charging him with sexual assault on\na child by a person in a position of trust, a felony.  Following a Miranda warning, Applicant was\nquestioned by the police.  After being informed that he had failed a polygraph examination,\n\nNorth Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970).  \n1\n3\nApplicant acknowledged that he committed the conduct with Daughter.  For six months or more\nApplicant lived with his parents.  The State Department of Social Services convened a panel, which\nconcluded that Applicant could not return to live with his wife and their two children.  Consistent\nwith State law, Applicant requested a jury trial on this matter and was permitted to return to his\nhome.\nSubsequent to that, Applicant entered an Alford  plea to third degree assault.  Applicant did\n1\nnot want to put his family through another trial and he had exhausted his financial resources.  If he\nlitigated the case and were found guilty, Applicant could have been sentenced to ten years in jail.\nFollowing Applicant\u2019 plea, the court sentenced him to two years probation and a fine.  He was\nordered to undergo a psychological examination.  In addition, the court issued a permanent\nrestraining order requiring him to stay away from Daughter.  He has had no contact with his daughter\nor ex-wife since November 1998.\nWhen completing his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant checked \u201cnot\napplicable\u201d in reply to the question inquiring about whether he had a former spouse.  When\nanswering the question about his other relatives, he listed his parents and siblings but he did not list\nany of his children, including Daughter.  To the question as to whether he had ever been charged\nwith or convicted of a felony, he answered \u201cno.\u201d   These answers were not factually correct.\nApplicant did not list his first marriage because \u201cit was a long time ago, his first wife is not a part\nof his life and he is trying to put his contacts with her behind him.\u201d   He did not list the arrest for\nsexual assault on Daughter because he believed he only had to list offenses less than seven years old.\n\u201cIn explaining his reason for not listing his former wife and oldest daughter, he said \u2018[he] did not\nconsider those two people part of my life anymore.\u2019\u201d Id. at 5.   Applicant stated that he did not take\nthe security clearance process seriously and was not thorough when completing his SCA.\nApplicant\u2019s wife and family are aware of his arrest and the circumstances surrounding it.  His\nboss is also aware of his arrest and plea.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n\n4\nThe Board will address whether the Judge\u2019s decision is supported by substantial record\nevidence in the course of the discussion below. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nWhether the Judge erred in her conclusion that the Government had not met its burden of\nproduction under two of the Guideline E allegations.\nThe SOR contains three allegations under Guideline E.  The first is that Applicant falsified\nhis SCA by omitting his former spouse.  The second is that he falsified the SCA by omitting\nDaughter.  The third is that he falsified the SCA by omitting his felony arrest for sexual assault on\nDaughter.  The Judge concluded that the Government had satisfied its burden with regard to the\nformer spouse.  The Judge stated, \u201c[Applicant] acknowledged that he realized that he thought about\n\nIn Government Exhibit (GE) 2, Subject Interview, dated December 2006, Applicant offered a different set of\n2\nexplanations for his omissions.  \n5\nhis first wife, but decided that the information was not necessary.  His decision not to acknowledge\nhis first marriage was deliberate.\u201d  Decision at 9.  This conclusion is sustainable.\nHowever, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to list Daughter was not deliberate,\non the ground that he failed to name any of his children through a simple mistake.  See Tr. at 47.  (\u201cI\ndon\u2019t understand how I missed that, Your Honor.  I really don\u2019t.  There\u2019s no reason I would\ndeliberately leave my current children off.\u201d)  The Judge does not explain why she finds this to be a\ncredible explanation for the omission, given the fact that the SCA explicitly requires an applicant\nto name any and all children he or she may have.  Be that as it may, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant did not deliberately omit Daughter\u2019s name is not even consistent with her own finding that\nhe omitted both his former wife and Daughter for the same reason.  That reason is that they were a\npart of his life that he wished to put behind him.  The Judge\u2019s finding is consistent with a portion of\nthe record evidence.  \u201cJudge: Is there a reason you would leave [Daughter] out?  Witness: Yes, Your\nHonor.  Judge: Why would you leave her out?  Witness: Same reason.  It\u2019s sad to say, but I disowned\nher after this incident and did not consider those two people part of my life anymore.\u201d  Tr. at 47.\n\u201cDepartment Counsel: . . . [I]t occurred to you to list your daughter and your wife, but you chose not\nto.  A: Right.  I believe that\u2019s correct.\u201d  Tr. at 50.   In evaluating whether the Government has\n2\npresented substantial evidence regarding the deliberate nature of a false statement or an omission,\nthe Judge must examine the statement or omission in light of the record as a whole. When an\napplicant claims that a false answer to a SCA question is not deliberate, the Judge should address\nexplicitly any contrary evidence in the record.  In this case Applicant\u2019s desire to relegate to the past\ntwo people who had accused him of sexual assault is, in and of itself, not surprising.  However,\ninsofar as that is a reason to believe that his omission of the former wife was deliberate, it is, a\nfortiari, a reason to believe the same thing about Daughter.  The Judge\u2019s decision does not provide\na rational basis for distinguishing between these omissions.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that the\nGovernment had not presented substantial evidence regarding the deliberate nature of Applicant\u2019s\nomission of Daughter\u2019s name is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nThe Judge also concluded that the Government had not met its burden of production as to\nthe deliberate nature of Applicant\u2019s omission of his felony arrest for sexual assault on Daughter.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument that this conclusion is unsupported by record evidence is\npersuasive.  Applicant stated that he believed the question asked only for convictions during the prior\nseven years.  Applicant\u2019s explanation that he answered hurriedly and without reading the question\nclosely, while testimony the Judge had to consider, should have been balanced against other matters\nin the record which point to a deliberate omission.  The Judge reproduced this question verbatim in\nher findings of fact: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\u201d  The\nquestion is clear and unambiguous, containing no time limitation.  Given the fact that all three\nfactual omissions at issue in this case relate to Applicant\u2019s prior conviction arising from an allegation\nof sexual assault on his biological daughter, a reasonable person could infer that Applicant was\nomitting from his SCA any facts that would lead to discovery of that misconduct.  His testimony that\n\nApplicant testified as to advice he had received from his attorney.  \u201cHe told me that we could take it to trial,\n3\ncriminal trial, that it was going to be very costly, and if I was found guilty, then I could spend up to ten years in prison.\nAnd at that point, I was out of money.  I didn\u2019t want to drag my family back through all the proceedings again, and so\nI pled to assault to end everything.\u201d  Tr. at 42.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.31(a): \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.31(c): \u201callegation\n4\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted[.]\u201d  \n6\nhe failed to take the security clearance process seriously does not contravene such an inference.  Tr.\nat 20, 46.  The Judge\u2019s own conclusion that one of the omissions was deliberate is a matter which\nshe should have addressed in evaluating his state of mind regarding the other two.  Indeed, the\nmultiple nature of the omissions, and the fact that they were made contemporaneously, as well a his\nvarying explanations for the omissions, are matters which the Judge should have discussed.  Viewed\nas a whole, the record demonstrates that the Government presented substantial evidence of the\ndeliberate nature of Applicant\u2019s omission of his felony arrest.  The Judge\u2019s contrary conclusion is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nWhether the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions was unsupported by record\nevidence.  \nThe Judge properly concluded that the incident with Daughter raised security concerns under\nGuideline J.  Government Exhibit (GE) 6 includes a Probable Cause affidavit, which contains a\ndescription of the incident.  It includes information apparently provided by Daughter to the police.\nThe document states that Daughter \nvisited her father . . . for a regular visit.  She said that at bedtime she was sharing a\nbedroom with her half-sister . . . who is 7 years old.  She said her and [sister] were\nalso sharing a bed. [Daughter] said that she was asleep when her father entered the\nroom and woke her up, by touching her on the leg. [She] further stated . . . that her\nfather rubbed up her leg, resting his hand on her vagina. [She] believed her father\nrubbed her vagina, with one finger, in a circular motion. [She] stated that her father\ncontinued to rub her vaginal area and legs for approximately five to ten minutes.  \nGE 6 also contains a description of a pretext phone call Daughter made to Applicant.  \u201cDuring the\npretext phone call the suspect . . . did not . . . deny touching [Daughter].  He did extend to [her] an\napology for his actions.\u201d    During a subsequent interrogation by the police Applicant admitted that\nhe had \u201csexually molested [Daughter] by fondling her vagina on the night in question.\u201d  Tr. at 68.\nSee also Decision at 3.  The record, and the Judge\u2019s findings, demonstrate that as a consequence of\nhis actions, Applicant was charged with sexual assault and entered a plea of guilty to a lesser\nincluded offense in order to avoid the consequences to his family and to himself of a litigated trial.3\nThe Judge\u2019s conclusion that this matter is covered by two Guideline J disqualifying conditions  is\n4\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\n5\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities[.]\u201d   \n\u201cSubject in 11/98 was arrested and charged with sexual assault on his daughter . . . Subject after being charged\n6\nhad his attorney request this case to be heard in a court by a jury.  Several months after 11/98, this case went to trial.\nSubject testified and had other character witnesses testify on his behalf.  Subject recalls his ex-wife and daughter also\ntestified against him.  Subject recalls that once this case went to the jury, they only took less than one hour to reach a\nverdict.  Subject . . . stated that during this [trial] he was found to be not guilty by a jury.\u201d  GE 2 at 5.  \n7\nsustainable.  Additionally, the Judge\u2019s similar conclusion under Guideline E about Applicant\u2019s\nomission of his former wife is also sustainable.   \n5\nHowever, Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge erred in her analysis of the\npertinent  mitigating conditions.  Regarding Guideline J, the Judge concluded that Applicant had met\nhis burden of persuasion under three provisions in the Directive.  Criminal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition (CCMC) 32(a) mitigates security concerns when \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individuals\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.32(a).  CCMC 32(c) mitigates criminal conduct when there is \u201cevidence that the\nperson did not commit the offense[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.32(c).  CCMC 32(d) does so when \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.32(d).  Department Counsel argues that the\nJudge\u2019s analysis is not supported by record evidence.  The Board notes, for example, GE 2, a record\nof Applicant\u2019s subject interview conducted as part of his security clearance investigation.  This\ndocument describes Applicant\u2019s explanation to the investigator, taken under oath and concerning,\namong other things, the assault allegation.   In this document Applicant appears to claim that, as a\nconsequence of Daughter\u2019s allegation, he was taken to trial by a jury and found to be not guilty.6\nAlthough Applicant later stated that this was a reference to the civil hearing concerning his efforts\nto return home to his current wife, the statement itself, read in its entirety, could lead a reasonable\nperson to believe that Applicant was claiming to have been acquitted of the criminal charge of sexual\nassault.  There is nothing in the statement about his plea of guilty to the lesser included offense of\nassault.  Such a statement is consistent neither with the other record evidence nor the Judge\u2019s own\nfindings about the criminal trial in Applicant\u2019s case.  Furthermore, in this document Applicant\nattributes Daughter\u2019s assault accusation to her having been manipulated by the former wife, whom\nApplicant described as \u201cevil\u201d and jealous of Applicant\u2019s current spouse.  This is not totally\nconsistent with other evidence provided by Applicant, the implication of which is that Daughter\nreported Applicant to the police because she was angry that Applicant would not permit her to have\nan overnight guest.  Additionally, the Judge does not discuss the credibility of Applicant\u2019s testimony\nthat his confession, following a polygraph, was actually false and that he had confessed merely due\nto having been tired.  Tr. at 68.  These matters, especially when read in light of the omissions on the\nSCA, are not consistent with a view that Applicant has demonstrated reliability and good judgement,\nor that he has been rehabilitated.  The Judge does not adequately explain why she discounts the\nrecord evidence that impeaches Applicant\u2019s credibility and is contrary to her favorable resolution of\nthe case.   \n\nSee Crofoot v. U.S. Government Printing Office, 761 F.2d 661at 665, n. 1, (Fed. Cir. 1985) (A court that\n7\nreceives an Alford plea \u201cmust independently determine that the plea has a factual basis\u201d); U.S. v. Alber, 56 F. 3d 1106,\n1110 (9  Cir. 1995)(A court accepting an Alford plea must \u201cbe convinced that there is sufficient evidence to justify\u201d a\nth\nconclusion that an accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt); People v. Birdsong, 958 P.2d 1124 (Colorado 1998);\nWirsching v. Colorado, 360 F. 3d. 1191  (10  Cir. 2004).  See also 21 Am. Jur. 2d \u00b6  665 (\u201cin order to accept a guilty\nth\nplea by a defendant who continues to maintain his or her innocence, the court must determine that a strong factual basis\nexists establishing defendant\u2019s actual guilt.\u201d)   \nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.17(c): \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent,\n8\nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement[;]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.17(e): \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce\nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress[.]\u201d      \nCompare this the Judge\u2019s own finding that Applicant had also been arrested for DUI.\n9\n8\nThe Judge also concluded that Applicant had met the requirements of CCMC 32(c) by\nproviding evidence that he did not commit the offense.  Under the facts of this case, this appears to\nbe at odds with the Judge\u2019s other conclusions that Applicant had established that the offense would\nnot recur and that he had shown rehabilitation.  In any event, the Judge appears to conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s Alford plea to a lesser included offense and his denials of criminal conduct demonstrate\nthat the offense in question did not occur.  While the Judge framed her discussion in terms of sexual\nassault, it should be noted that Applicant has denied any criminal activity with Daughter, sexual or\notherwise.  The Judge does not explain why she finds this denial credible in light the record evidence\nas to the facts underlying Applicant\u2019s arrest; his admission to the police that he assaulted Daughter\nafter having been advised that he failed a polygraph examination; and his apparent inconsistent\nand/or meretricious statements concerning the incident and its aftermath.  The Judge appears to have\ngiven weight to the fact of the Alford plea, in which a defendant consents to the imposition of a\nsentence despite a denial of actual guilt.  However, a court cannot accept such a plea unless it also\nfinds that it is supported by facts sufficient to sustain a conviction.   Under the facts of this case, such\n7\na plea, in and of itself, is entitled to minimal favorable weight viewed in light of Applicant\u2019s\notherwise uncorroborated claims of innocence.  The record, viewed as a whole, will not sustain a\nconclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion as to the Guideline J mitigating\nconditions.\n    The Judge also concluded that Applicant has successfully mitigated the Guideline E\nallegation.   The Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s failure to list his previous wife \u201cis not significant\n8\nbecause the usual criminal background investigation in the security clearance process would and did\nreveal his first marriage and the arrest.  His 1998 arrest is his only criminal arrest.   There are no\n9\nother allegations of sexual misconduct involving his younger daughter.  Since he has no contact with\n[Daughter] or her mother, there is little likelihood of a reoccurrence.  His failure to acknowledge his\nfirst marriage does not cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgement.\u201d\nDecision at 9.  The Board finds this analysis problematic for a number of reasons.  First, the Judge\nevaluated Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation in light of only one of the three Guideline E allegations.\nHer failure to consider the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct  impairs her analysis.  Second, the Judge\u2019s\ndiscussion focuses not only on his falsification but is based to a large extent on the fact that\n\n9\nApplicant has not been accused of further sexual misconduct.  This does not logically mitigate\nsecurity concerns arising from record evidence of three different omissions on his SCA.  That is, the\ngravamen of the Guideline E allegations is that Applicant did not provide correct responses to three\nseparate questions on the SCA.  Evidence that he has not been accused of other sexual misconduct\ndoes not demonstrate that the omissions in question are minor, are not recent, or are not likely to\nrecur.  Third, Applicant\u2019s apparent false statement in GE 6 about an acquittal, made after he\ncompleted his SCA, further undercuts a conclusion that his false statements are not likely to recur.\nFourth, the Judge\u2019s analysis does not explain what Applicant has done to reduce or eliminate the\npossibility of duress arising from these omissions.  The record, viewed as a whole, will not sustain\na conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under the Guideline E mitigating\nconditions.\nNeither will the record sustain a favorable whole-person analysis.  In that section of her\ndecision, the Judge states that the allegation of sexual misconduct \u201carose out of a problematic family\nsituation and one particular weekend.  In this case, the allegation arose after a difficult weekend\nvisiting with his oldest daughter.  A jury of his peers, however, concluded that he should return to\nhis home to live with his family after hearing days of testimony from all persons involved.  The jury\nconsidered balanced testimony and ultimately overruled a negative determination by a social services\npanel.  Moreover, the jury found him not to be a threat to his younger daughter.  I infer from the\ndecision of the jury that the evidence failed to establish sexual misconduct by Applicant.\u201d  Decision\nat 10.  The trial to which the Judge refers was the previously-mentioned civil hearing on the question\nof whether Applicant should be permitted to live with his current wife and children.  The only\nevidence in the record about this hearing comes from Applicant himself.  Even assuming that the\nevidence is correct, it establishes nothing more than Applicant\u2019s fitness to live with his second\nfamily.  It provides no basis for the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not commit misconduct\ninvolving Daughter, or to undermine the court\u2019s order in the criminal trial that Applicant have no\nfurther contact with her.  Neither does it provide a reason to mitigate Applicant\u2019s omissions on the\nSCA.  The Judge stated that Applicant \u201crecognizes his responsibilities and accepts them.  There is\nno apparent link between an alleged incident of sexual assault in 1998 and Applicant\u2019s ability to\nprotect classified information.\u201d  Id.  It is not clear why the Judge concludes that Applicant accepts\nresponsibility, or for what, in light of his denial of having committed any misconduct with Daughter\nat all and his insistence that she and/or his ex wife fabricated the basis for his arrest and subsequent\nassault conviction.  To sum up, the record contains substantial evidence that Applicant was accused\nof felony sexual misconduct involving Daughter; that he admitted the misconduct to the police\nfollowing a polygraph; that consistent with his plea the court found him guilty of a misdemeanor\nassault on Daughter; that the court ordered him permanently to stay away from Daughter;  that he\nomitted any reference to these matters in his SCA; and that he made inconsistent statements\nconcerning these matters.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion\nunder the Egan standard, either regarding the mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors in\nthe Directive, is not sustainable.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is arbitrary, capricious,\nand contrary to law.\n\n10\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

On December 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 4, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on January 7, 2008. The Department Counsel requested a hearing\nMay 30, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance Application, dated September 18, 2006) at 2, 7-8, 14-17; Tr. 27. \n1\nGE 2 (Interrogatories to Applicant, including a copy of a summary of his investigative interview and his\n2\nanswer) at 3-4; Tr. 28-30, 54, 79.\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 10-11; Tr. 27-28.\n3\n2\nbefore an Administrative Judge on January 15, 2008. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on February 27, 2008, and I received the case assignment on\nFebruary 28, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on April 30, 2008. The government offered seven\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He did not submit any exhibits. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008. The record closed on April\n30, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 2.c, alleging\nApplicant falsified his response to question 23 on his Security Clearance Application\n(SF-86) by failing to list his felony arrest in 1998. (Tr. 8-9.) Applicant objected to the\nmotion, arguing that he had explained everything previously. (Tr. 12-13.) I granted the\nmotion to amend and added a third allegation of falsification to \u00b6 2 of the SOR. (Tr. 13.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 20, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b of the SOR, with explanations. At the\nhearing, he objected to the addition of \u00b6 2.c. His objection is taken as a denial of the\nallegation.\nApplicant is a 46 year old electronics laboratory technician, who works for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He began working in the electronics industry\nfollowing his honorable discharge from the United States Marine Corps 24 years ago.\nHe has worked for his current employer for seven years.  \n1\nApplicant married his first wife in early 1986. They divorced 18 months later in\n1987. He has one daughter, K, from his marriage. She is 21 years old. Under the terms\nof their divorce settlement, his wife received custody of their infant daughter and he had\nvisitation rights every other weekend. He also paid monthly child support until K was 19\nyears old. His visitation with K ended in November 1998.  \n2\nApplicant married his present wife in 1989. They have two children, a son, who is\n18, and a daughter, who is 17. Both children are honor students in school.  \n3\n\nGE 2, supra note 2, at 3-5; GE 4 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated August 9, 2007) at 1-3; GE 5 (Federal Bureau\n4\nof Investigation, criminal records); Tr. 29-35, 38.\nGE 2, supra note 2, at 3-5; GE 4, supra note 4, at 1-3; GE 6 (Police affidavit, dated November 16, 1998); Tr.\n5\n35, 37.\nGE 5, supra note 4; Tr. 36-38, 64-68. \n6\n3\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant with driving while intoxicated (DUI) in\n1986. In November 1998, Applicant\u2019s daughter, K, came for a scheduled weekend visit.\nThe entire visit was problematic. He denied K\u2019s request to have a friend visit for the\nweekend. He believes his denial upset her. When she visited, K shared a bedroom with\nher step-sister, who is four years younger. Applicant states that K and his two other\nchildren got along with each other, but that K and his wife did not. In addition, his wife\nand ex-wife did not get along. His first wife resented his remarriage and often created\nproblems for the family.4\nApplicant\u2019s memory of the events of November 1998 is not completely clear.\nBased on his best recollection and the evidence of record, I make the following factual\nfindings. K returned home at the end of her visit. Shortly after, she called Applicant and\ntold him she knew what he had done - that he touched her in the wrong places. He\ndenied any wrongdoing and told he was sorry she was upset. The police report\nindicates that K told the police about this alleged conduct and that Applicant also\nimproperly touched his other daughter at the same time. It also shows that, at around\n1:30 a.m., with the police on the telephone line, K called Applicant. (He was asleep\nwhen this call occurred). The report states that Applicant denied improperly touching his\nyounger daughter and that he admitted his conduct with K. Applicant, however, denies\nthat this conduct occurred with K.5\nThe police arrested Applicant on November 16, 1998 and charged him with\nsexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust, a class three felony. The\npolice interrogated Applicant for a number of hours after reciting his Miranda rights. He\ndid not request an attorney for the interrogation. At the end of the interrogation, he\nacknowledged the conduct after he was told he lied on a polygraph examination. A\npolygraph exam is not admissible into court.6\nThe State did not allow Applicant to return to his family home. For the next six\nmonths or more, Applicant lived with his parents while the State investigated. The State\nDepartment of Social Services convened a panel to determine if Applicant could return\nhome. He appeared at this proceeding with his attorney and his wife. The panel\ndetermined that he could not return home. Under State law, Applicant requested a civil\njury trial on the issue of his return home. After a three day trial where Applicant, his wife,\nhis daughter K, his character witnesses, and others testified, the jury determined that he\n\nGE 2, supra note 2, at 3-5; GE 3 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated August 29, 2007); GE 4, supra note 4, at 1-3;\n7\nTr. 38-41, 55-59, 63.\nGE 2, supra note 2, at 3-5; GE 4, supra note 4, at 1-3; Tr. 42-45; 59-62.\n8\nTr. 44-47.\n9\n4\nshould return home. He immediately returned to his family, where he continues to live.\nHis younger daughter has not alleged any sexual misconduct by him.7\nFollowing the civil trial, Applicant\u2019s attorney entered into discussions with the\nState prosecutor regarding a plea agreement. His attorney had explained to him that if\nhe was found guilty, he could spend 10 years in jail. Because he had exhausted his\nfinancial resources and did not want to put his family through another trial, he decided to\naccept a plea agreement. He entered an Alford plea to third degree assault, a\nmisdemeanor. The court sentenced him to two years probation, fined him, directed a\npsychological examination be administered, and issued a permanent restraining order\nrequiring him to stay away from K. Applicant complied with the terms of his sentence.\nThe record contains no evidence that the psychological evaluation indicated a problem\nwith any kind of deviance. Applicant has not been arrested for any misconduct since\nNovember 1998.8\nApplicant\u2019s former wife filed for a permanent retraining order, which the court\nissued in April 2000. Applicant received no papers from the court. He did not learn\nabout the restraining order until recently. He has not had any contact with his ex-wife\nand K since November 1998.  \n9\nWhen he completed his security clearance application, Applicant answered the\nquestions as follows:\nSection 13/15: Your Spouse\nFormer Spouse(s) (not Applicable:(x)). He provided no entry.\nSection 14/15: Your Relatives\nHe listed his parents and siblings, but he did not list any of his children.\nSection 23: Your Police Record\nApplicant answered no to all questions including:\na. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\n(Include those Under Uniform Code of Military Justice)\n\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 9-14, 18.\n10\nTr. 46-52.\n11\nId. at 27, 80.\n12\n5\nand two subsequent questions in this segment which limit the time to the last seven\nyears. Several prior segments limited the time necessary for a response to seven\nyears.10\nApplicant acknowledges that he decided not to list his first marriage when he\ncompleted his SF-86 because it was a long time ago, his first wife is not a part of his life\nand he is trying to put his contacts with her behind him. He did not list his 1998 arrest\nbecause he thought he needed to list any arrests which occurred in the seven years\nbefore September 2006 and his arrest was more than seven years old. He knew his\narrest would be discovered during the investigative process. He doesn\u2019t know why he\ndid not list any of his children, but acknowledged that he disowned his oldest daughter\nafter his arrest. In explaining his reason for not listing his former wife and oldest\ndaughter, he said \u201c[he] did not consider those two people part of my life anymore.\u201d He\nacknowledges that he did not take the security clearance process seriously and was not\nthorough when completing his SF-86.   \n11\nApplicant\u2019s wife and family are fully aware of his arrest and the circumstances\nsurrounding the events in 1998 with his daughter, K. His boss also knows about his\narrest and plea. Applicant describes his life now as the best it has ever been.12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n6\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 31, the following disqualifying conditions could raise a security\nconcern and may apply:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nAs a result of K\u2019s allegations, the police charged Applicant with sexual assault on\na child by a person in a position of trust, a class three felony. After many months of\ncourt proceedings, the Applicant reached a plea agreement with the prosecutor. He\n\n985 P.2d 1123 (1998).\n13\n7\nentered an Alford plea to third degree assault, a misdemeanor. The court sentenced\nhim to two years of probation and issued a permanent restraining order directing him to\nremain away from his daughter. Consequently, the above disqualifying conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement; and,\nThe 1998 sexual assault allegation by his oldest daughter is the only criminal\ncharge against Applicant in the last 20 years. Despite his acknowledgment of the sexual\nmisconduct to the police after several hours of interrogation and lack of legal counsel,\nApplicant has consistently denied the conduct. He entered an Alford plea, which under\nstate law is a plea of guilty that permits a defendant to assert innocence as to one or\nmore elements of the crime, but consent to the imposition of the conviction and penalty.\nApplicant pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge, but not to felony sexual assault.\nHis plea reflects his contention that he did not sexually assault K. Applicant was\nunaware of the April 2000 restraining order, but knew that the court had ordered him to\nstay away from his oldest daughter at the time of his plea and sentence. He has stayed\naway from his daughter and has no intent to ever contact her again.13\nWhen the State refused to allow Applicant to return to live with his family, he\nrequested a civil jury trial on this issue. After three days of trial and testimony from all\nparties involved, including his oldest daughter, the jury concluded that he could return\nas he was not a threat to his younger daughter. Since his arrest in 1998, Applicant has\nnot been arrested by the police for anything. He works steadily and has a very good\nfamily relationship. The above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline J.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\n\n8\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nUnder AG \u00b6 16, the following disqualifying condition that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nThe government argues that by not listing his former wife and oldest daughter in\nhis answers to Section 13 to 15 of the SF-86, Applicant was deliberating trying to hide\ninformation which would reveal his arrest for sexually assaulting his oldest daughter. I\nmust first determine whether the omission of these facts is material. Under normal\ncircumstances, the omission of prior spouses and children is not necessarily relevant to\na determination of security worthiness. In this case, the omission is relevant. The\ngovernment has established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86 when\nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 23 and failed to acknowledge his first marriage and his\noldest daughter. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty because, in this case,\nthis information concerns the allegation of serious criminal conduct. \nFor this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. He denies,\nhowever, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these questions. When a\nfalsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.\nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n14\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n9\noccurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\n14\nomission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant\u2019s omission of his oldest daughter\u2019s name is not deliberate. He failed to\nlist any of his children as relatives when completing his SF-86. He acknowledged that\nhe realized that he thought about his first wife, but decided that the information was not\nnecessary. His decision not to acknowledge his first marriage was deliberate. The\ngovernment has not established its case as to allegation 2.b of the SOR, but it has\nestablished it case as to allegation 2.a of the SOR.\nConcerning his failure to list his 1998 arrest, Applicant has credibly testified to his\ncarelessness when completing the SF-86. While the question clearly asks \u201cever\u201d, many\nof the questions proceeding it do request information for the last seven years.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to be careful in answering Section 23 is insufficient to establish\nintentional misconduct. The government has not established its case under allegation\n2.c of the SOR.\nI have reviewed the potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and conclude\nthat only the following conditions may applicable:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\nApplicant wants to put his life and relationship with his first wife and oldest\ndaughter behind him, particularly after his arrest in 1998. His failure to acknowledge his\nfirst marriage is not significant because the usual criminal background investigation in\nthe security clearance process would and did reveal his first marriage and the arrest.\nHis 1998 arrest is his only criminal arrest. There are no other allegations of sexual\nmisconduct involving his younger daughter. Since he has no contact with K or her\nmother, there is little likelihood of a reoccurrence. His failure to acknowledge his first\nmarriage does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\n\n10\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The allegation of sexual misconduct\nagainst Applicant is very serious, and arose out of a problematic family situation and\none particular weekend. In this case, the allegation arose after a difficult weekend\nvisitation with his oldest daughter. A jury of his peers, however, concluded that he\nshould return to his home to live with his family after hearing days of testimony from all\npersons involved. The jury considered balanced testimony and ultimately overruled a\nnegative determination by a social services panel. Moreover, the jury found him not a\nthreat to his younger daughter. I infer from the decision of the jury that the evidence\nfailed to establish sexual misconduct by Applicant. Indeed, the jury decision also\nseriously impacted the prosecution\u2019s criminal case and ultimately lead to a plea\nagreement in which Applicant maintained his innocence regarding the sexual assault\ncharge. \nOutside of this arrest, Applicant has not been involved with the justice system for\nany other serious crime. As a young person, he had one DUI which occurred more than\n20 years ago. He provides for his family. He works regularly and has been employed by\nhis current employer for seven years. He paid his child support to his ex-wife for eight\nyears after his arrest even though he purposely avoided contact with K. He recognizes\nhis responsibilities and accepts them. There is no apparent link between an alleged\nincident of sexual assault in 1998 and Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information.\nThus, the 1998 incident and matters related to that incident cannot be a source of\nimproper pressure or duress.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal and\npersonal conduct. \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He came to the United\nStates in 1997, and became a United States citizen in 2004.  He obtained a United States passport\nthat same year.  He has family members and friends who are citizens and residents of Nigeria.  He\nhas continuous contact with these people.  Applicant obtained a new Nigerian passport in June 2006,\nand used it to enter Nigeria in March 2007.  He has not surrendered the passport.  Applicant failed\nto present sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for foreign influence and foreign\npreference.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for all SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant\nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 30, 2007.  He admitted all but one of the\nallegations, allegation l, under both guidelines, and provided a clarification for allegation 1.l, that\nhe denied.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 13, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on June 25, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  He proved additional information on July 8, 2007, and Department Counsel noted no\nobjections to consideration of the additional information on July 12, 2007.  The case was assigned\nto me on July 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 46 years old and has been an audit supervisor for a defense contractor for eight\nyears.  He was born in Nigeria and came to the United States at age 35.  He received his accounting\ndegree from a Nigerian university before immigrating to the United States in 1997.  He became a\nUnited States citizen in March 2004, and received a United States passport in May 2004.  He also\nadmitted that he renewed his Nigerian passport in July 2006 after becoming a United States citizen.\nHis Nigerian passport is still current and in his possession.  He used it in March 2007 to enter\nNigeria to see his mother.  He is married and his wife is a dual United States and Nigerian citizen\nresiding with Applicant in the United States.  He has two minor children born in the United States\nwho are citizens and residents of the United States.\n\nItem 3; Item 4, at 6-7, 18-25.\n1\nItem 3.\n2\nResponse to FORM., dated July 8, 2007.\n3\nItem I.\n4\nItem III.\n5\nItem IV.\n6\nItem V.\n7\n3\nHis mother is a resident and citizen of Nigeria.  He has four siblings who are citizens and\nresidents of Nigeria.  His in-laws are both citizens and residents of Nigeria.   Applicant also admits\n1\nhe has brothers-in-law, three of which are residents and citizens of Nigeria, and one a citizen of\nNigeria residing in Finland.  He also admits he has four close friends, three who are citizens and \nresidents of Nigeria, and one a citizen of Nigeria residing in the United States.  He also admits he\nowns real estate and stocks in Nigeria.2\nApplicant noted that he does not represent any foreign government, especially the\ngovernment of Nigeria.  He is not and has never been a member of any militant organization that is\na threat to the security of the United States.  He maintains contact with his family members and old\nfriends in Nigeria.  Some of these contacts are with fellow religious leaders.3\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s most populated country, with over a half of the population of all of Africa.\nNigeria became independent from Great Britain in 1960, and has a constitutional parliamentary\ngovernment.  The country was ruled by the military until 1999 when there was a democratic election\nbringing back civilian rule.   The Department of State continuously issues travel warnings because\n4\nof chaos and lawlessness in Nigeria.  Lawlessness in Nigeria leads to car bombings, kidnaping of\nforeigners, and violent crimes.  Violence is particularly acute in the Niger Delta region.  Religious\ntension between Muslims and Christians results in occasional acts of communal violence.  Al-Qaida\nleadership has expressed interest in overthrowing the government.  Road and air travel are\ndangerous.   The government\u2019s human rights record is poor and government officials commit serious\n5\nhuman rights abuses.  These include the abridgment of rights to change government, politically\nmotivated killings by security forces, use of excessive force and torture, restriction on free speech\nand press, and other physical human rights abuses.   Nigeria has made progress in a fragile\n6\ndemocracy.  Nigeria is one of the United States\u2019 key strategic partners in Africa.  It become a major\nplayer in Africa helping to negotiate settlements with other countries and play a vital role in\npeacekeeping operations.  Nigeria remains relatively stable although ethnic and religious clashes in\npart of the country are common.7\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n9\nAG \u00b6 2(a).\n10\nId.\n11\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n12\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n4\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n8\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.9\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access\nto classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  The adjudicative guidelines for this case are the guidelines promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2007.  Each\nclearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, and the whole person concept.10\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\nrecurrence.11\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n12\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.13\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n14\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n15\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (App. Bd. Dec 13, 2000).\n16\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n17\n1993))\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\n18\n5\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n15\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n16\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n17\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 18\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline B - Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interest, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in such a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nGuideline C - When an Applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s family members and friends in Nigeria raise Foreign Influence Disqualifying\nCondition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).  Applicant\nhas family members, his mother and siblings, his in-laws and brothers-in-law, friends and professional\n\n6\nassociates, who are all citizens and residents of Nigeria.  He admits he has continuous contact with\nthese people that he considers natural and generally acceptable.  Applicant\u2019s ownership of property and\nstock in Nigeria also raises FI DC \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a\nforeign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation).  Applicant admits he owns property\nand stock in Nigeria from his early life in his native country.  The presence of individuals and property\nand financial interests in Nigeria creates a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion for Applicant because of the general nature of violence and lawlessness in\nNigeria as well as terrorist activities.  There is no heightened concern for his brother-in-law who is a\nresident of Finland, and his friend who is a resident of the United States.  Security concerns for these\ntwo individuals has not been established.\nThe disqualifying conditions can be mitigated by Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI\nMC) \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization or government and the interests of the U.S.); FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Interest); FC MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation); and FC MC \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business,\nfinancial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual).  The relationship between\nApplicant and his family and friends in Nigeria is not causal and is not infrequent.  He admits to\nmaintaining contact with them which he describes as natural and generally acceptable.  Since\nApplicant\u2019s family and friends are located in Nigeria, a country that is violent, has significant criminal\nactivity, with terrorism and lawlessness that the United States State Department continuously issues\na travel warning for the country, Applicant can be placed in a position to chose between his family and\nfriends and the interests of the United States.  Applicant presents no information that the family and\nfriends are not vulnerable to activities or individuals that would exploit, manipulate or pressure\nApplicant to make such choices.  \nAdditionally, Applicant does not present sufficient information to conclude that he has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that he would resolve conflicts\nin favor of the United States.  In fact, the information leads to a conclusion that he does not have long\nstanding loyalties.  He came to the United States only 14 years ago.  He obtained a Nigerian passport\nafter he became a United States citizen and had a United States passport.  He has not established that\nhis relationships and loyalty to the United States is deep and longstanding.  At best, his loyalties are\nsplit between Nigeria and the United States.\nApplicant presented no information on the nature of his property and financial interests in\nNigeria.  While the property interest may be small and the stock worth only $15,000, Applicant has\nnot presented any information that the interests could not result in a conflict or could not be used to\ninfluence, manipulate or pressure.  Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns for foreign\ninfluence.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s possession of a valid Nigerian passport raises Foreign Preference Disqualifying\nCondition (FP DC) \u00b6 10(a)(1) (exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. Citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is\nnot limited to : (1) possession of a current foreign passport.  This disqualifying condition can be\nmitigated by Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) \u00b6 11(d) (use of a foreign passport is\napproved by the cognizant security authority, and \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated).  Applicant renewed his\nNigerian passport in June 2006, and used it in March 2007 to enter Nigeria.  He presented no\ninformation that he had the approval of a security official to use the passport.  Applicant has the\npassport in his possession and it has not been destroyed or surrendered to cognizant security authority.\nApplicant\u2019s possession of a current usable Nigerian passport establishes a foreign preference for\nNigeria.  I find against Applicant for foreign preference.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Voelker, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns raised by his \nalcohol related incidents. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 3, 2006. On November 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct).1  \n \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJune 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 19, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2008. \nThe Notice of Hearing was issued on January 23, 2008, convening a hearing on \nFebruary 26, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \npresented eight exhibits, marked GE 1-8, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant presented two witnesses, testified on his own behalf, and presented 23 \nexhibits, marked AE 1-23, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on March 5, 2008. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nThe Government moved to amend the first sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.b, by deleting \nthe date \u201cAugust 5, 2006,\u201d and substituting the date \u201cApril 30, 2005.\u201d Applicant did not \nobject. I granted the motion (Tr. 10).  \n \nThe Government elected not to pursue the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, conceding \nthat under Applicant\u2019s state law, driving under the influence is considered a civil \ninfraction and not a criminal offense (Tr. 11-12). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. He denied, however, the validity of the allegations reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.e, and 2.a, and provided explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his \ndemeanor, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior electrical engineer. From 1986 to 1990, he \nserved in the U.S. Army on active duty. His service was characterized as honorable. \nAfter his discharge he served in his state National Guard for four years (Tr. 102, 138). \nHe received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, and then completed a Master in \nScience and Technology Management in 2006 (Tr. 103).  \n \nApplicant has been working for a defense contractor for approximately 10 years \nduring which he has had access to classified information at the secret level (Tr. 103, GE \n1). There is no evidence to suggest, and the Government does not allege, that Applicant \nhas ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. Nor does \nthe record evidence show that Applicant has ever failed to follow the rules and \nregulations required to protect classified information.  \n \nApplicant has a reputation as a gifted engineer who is extremely dedicated and \nresourceful. Numerous certificates of appreciation/achievement, monetary awards, and \noutstanding performance appraisals attest to his excellent work history, character and \nprofessionalism (AE 4-21).  \nApplicant and his wife have known each other for approximately 10 years, and \nmarried in June 2004. They have an 18-month-old daughter, and his wife was \n\n \n3 \n \n \nscheduled to deliver a boy in April 2008 (Tr. 59). He also has a 15-year-old daughter \nfrom a prior relationship. \n \nApplicant has a history of episodic alcohol abuse, marked by his involvement in \nfive alcohol related incidents. In June 1987, Applicant was arrested and found guilty of \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI). He received probation before judgment. While serving in \nthe Army, Applicant consumed alcohol frequently and was counseled informally by his \nsupervisors for what he called his \u201cafter working hour\u2019s problem\u201d (Tr. 140). Applicant \nreceived non-judicial punishment because he was late to work as a result of being hung \nover from drinking the night before (Tr. 139). He remembers blacking out one time \nduring his period in the Army. \n \nApplicant continued drinking alcohol while in college. He remembered having one \nor two blackouts/passing out as a result of his alcohol consumption. In January 1996, \nApplicant was involved in a one car accident. He was driving to the dorm through ice \nand snow at around 10:00 P.M. His car slid on the ice and hit a sign post, losing his \ncar\u2019s tag. After inspecting the car, Applicant continued on his way home where college \nfriends awaited him. He claimed he had not consumed any alcoholic beverages before \nthe accident. Applicant and his friends partied and consumed alcoholic beverages all \nnight long that night. The next morning, police officers investigating the accident noticed \nApplicant\u2019s smell of alcohol and he was arrested and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). The charges were dismissed in court (Tr. 163). \n \n \nIn July 1996, Applicant had two or three alcoholic drinks with dinner and drove \nhis car home. He failed to obey an intersection stop sign and was arrested and charged \nwith driving under the influence (DUI) and failure to obey the stop sign (Tr. 110). In \nNovember 1997, he was found not guilty of the DUI, but guilty of failing to obey the stop \nsign. He was given probation before judgment (Tr. 112, 166). \n \n \nApplicant worked intermittently at a bar as a security person (bouncer) and bar \nbackup (stocking and cleaning) from 1995 to 2007 (Tr. 104, 141). In April 2005, after \nworking at the bar, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages with his bar co-workers to \nthe point of intoxication. He then drove his car home, lost control of the car and hit a \nbridge and a truck. He was charged with DWI, found guilty, and given one-year \nprobation before judgment (Tr. 118, 168). As a condition of his probation, Applicant was \nrequired to report to his probation officer, and to abstain from drinking alcohol (Tr. 168-\n169). Applicant stopped drinking for almost one-year; however, he started consuming \nalcohol before his probation term was over (Tr. 190). \n \nApplicant attempted to control his alcohol consumption by practicing controlled \ndrinking. He did not attend alcohol counseling/therapy, Alcoholic Anonymous (AA), nor \ndid he change his lifestyle. His controlled drinking did not work. Between April 2005 and \nAugust 2006, Applicant consumed alcohol approximately 10 times, four of which he \nconsumed alcohol to excess (Tr. 119).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn a Friday in August 2006, Applicant was playing music at a bar and drinking. \nHe drank alcoholic beverages while consuming cold medication. He then drove home, \nlost control of his car and rear ended another vehicle. He was arrested, charged with, \nand convicted of DWI. He was sentenced to 60 days jail (suspended), to pay a fine, and \nplaced on probation. He was also required to attend victim impact group meetings, AA \ncounseling, and to abstain from alcohol. In March 2008, he successfully complied with \nthe conditions of his probation (except for payment of $192) (GE 23 at 4). \n \nThe next working day after his DWI arrest, Applicant notified his employer of his \nDWI arrest and alcohol problem. He was enrolled in the company\u2019s \u201cEmployee Family \nAssistance Program\u201d (Tr. 121), and referred to formal therapy/counseling. He also was \nassigned a company manager (a recovering alcoholic) as a mentor to assist him as an \ninformal AA coordinator (Tr. 123, 150). He met with the company mentor for \napproximately six months after his 2006 DWI (AE 22). \n \nAfter his August 2006 DWI arrest, Applicant realized he had an alcohol problem \nand that he needed help. He immediately began attending AA meetings, and attended \n90 AA meetings in 90 days (Tr. 124). He has continued to attend AA meetings, at least \nfour times a week, to the day of the hearing. He finds the meetings helpful and promised \nto continue attending AA meetings.  \n \nFrom August 2006 to September 2007, Applicant participated in an Intensive \nOutpatient Counseling Program. He was evaluated and received counseling from a \nstate certified chemical dependence counselor who is also a licensed clinical alcohol \nand drug counselor. Applicant was diagnosed as being alcohol dependent; however, his \nprognosis is very favorable (AE 1). The counselor noted that Applicant has gained good \ninsight into his addiction and his need to be in recovery . . . he sees the problems his \nbehavior has created for him and others . . . and understands the potential \nconsequences if the situation is not rectified (AE 1).  \n \nIn the counselor\u2019s opinion, Applicant has been willing to do whatever necessary \nto maintain his sobriety. This is evidenced by Applicant maintaining contact with the \ncounselor on a regular basis even after the conclusion of the formal treatment, regular \nattendance at several meetings of AA a week, strong sponsor contact, great family \nsupport, stable employment and strong work ethic, participation in the employer\u2019s \nassistance program, and Applicant\u2019s attitude (AE 1). Applicant\u2019s AA sponsor has known \nhim for approximately one-year as they attend the same AA meetings. Applicant \nchanged AA sponsors about five weeks prior to the hearing because the prior sponsor \nwas unavailable due to his travel schedule. Applicant\u2019s current sponsor believes \nApplicant is doing all he can to maintain sobriety. Applicant has a great attitude; he is \ncommitted and dedicated to being sober (Tr. 45-53). \n \nApplicant testified the last time he consumed alcoholic beverages was in August \n2006. He credibly testified he has been sober since (Tr. 133). Applicant\u2019s testimony is \ncorroborated by his wife\u2019s testimony, as well as the testimony of his AA sponsor, and \nthe statement provided by his company\u2019s mentor (AE 22). He further testified his \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \ntherapy taught him to change his lifestyle to be able to stop drinking (Tr. 134). In April \n2007, he stopped working at the bar to stop being around people consuming alcohol.  \n \nAfter his August 2006 arrest, Applicant realized he had a drinking problem and \nsought help for the first time. His arrest was very close to his daughter\u2019s birth and he \nrealized he was at the brink of losing his family (Tr. 64). His wife confirmed Applicant \nhas changed his lifestyle. His behavior is now family oriented, assisting with the care of \nhis daughter, attending church meetings, working on remodeling his rental property, and \navoiding friends who may be a bad influence (Tr. 134-135).  \n \nApplicant continues to play music with his band, sometimes playing at bars \nwhere alcohol is being served. During 2007, he played music in bars six times (Tr. 158-\n159). His last performance at a bar was in January 2008. Applicant claimed the entire \nband members know about his alcohol problem and protect him from drinking alcoholic \nbeverages (Tr. 186). \n \nApplicant testified he understands the seriousness of his past behavior and takes \nfull responsibility for his actions. He has made a conscious decision to be sober \nbecause of his concern to keep his marriage, his job, and to take care of his family. His \npast drinking behavior was a contributing factor to the ending of a prior relationship with \nthe mother of his 15 year-old daughter (Tr. 160). \n \nHaving observed closely Applicant\u2019s demeanor, I find his testimony credible. At \nhis hearing, Applicant promptly answered all the questions asked. He was frank, candid, \nand forthcoming in his answers and explained his answers without hesitation. He readily \nadmitted his bad behavior and apologized numerous times for his questionable \nbehavior. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his actions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), the government\u2019s concern is that \nexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G by showing that in June \n1987, while serving in the Army, in July 1996, in April 2005, and in August 2006 \nApplicant was involved in questionable behavior related to his alcohol consumption. \nApplicant drove while under the influence of alcohol in 1987, 1996, 2005, and 2006. He \nwas convicted of DWI in 1987 and 2006. He received probation before judgment in \n2005.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s \nexcessive \nalcohol \nconsumption \nresulted \nin \nhis \nexercising \nquestionable judgment. Additionally, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2006. \nGuideline G disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents away from \nwork, such as driving while under the influence,\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c): \u201chabitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(e): \u201cevaluation \nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a license clinical social worker who is staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d apply.  \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n \n \n(c): the individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and \nrelapse, and is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d): the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find Guideline G \nmitigating conditions AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s most recent DUI is recent. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) applies. Applicant has acknowledged his alcohol dependence, presented \ncredible evidence of actions taken to overcome his problem, and established he has \nbeen abstinent for 18 months. He is remorseful for his behavior and has initiated \n\n \n8 \n \n \nchanges in his lifestyle. His performance appraisals, certificates of achievement, \nmonetary awards, and the statements from his company\u2019s Employee and Family \nAssistance Program coordinator show Applicant\u2019s work behavior has not been indicative \nof his having an alcohol problem. He is considered a valuable employee, who is reliable, \ndependable, and professional. Overall, he has made satisfactory progress in his \ncounseling and treatment program. AG \u00b6 23(c) applies. His wife, counselor, and AA \nsponsor corroborated he has abstained from alcohol since October 2006. Furthermore, \nApplicant received a favorable prognosis after he completed his intensive outpatient \nalcohol counseling, and continues his frequent participation in AA. At his hearing, \nApplicant acknowledged his issues of alcohol abuse, demonstrated remorse, and \npromised to continue his lifestyle changes and to remain abstinent. AG \u00b6 23(d) applies. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nThe Government conceded Applicant\u2019s behavior did not involve criminal conduct \nunder state law, and did not pursue the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2. I find this allegation for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and educated \n\n \n9 \n \n \nman. He served honorably in the Army for approximately four years. He has worked for \nthe same defense contractor and has had access to classified information at the secret \nlevel for approximately 10 years. Except for the pending allegations, there is no \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior or, more importantly that he has ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant has been willing to do whatever necessary to maintain his sobriety, \nincluding maintaining contact with his counselor on a regular basis even after the \nconclusion of the formal treatment and attending several AA meetings a week. He has \ngreat family support, stable employment and a strong work ethic. His participation in the \nemployer\u2019s assistance program, and his company support should ensure his successful \nrehabilitation. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and commitment to being \nsober. Considering his demeanor and testimony, I believe Applicant has learned from \nhis mistakes, and his questionable behavior is unlikely to recur. In sum, I find Applicant \nhas presented sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old Merchant Marine who has worked for the same defense contractor as a marine engineer since approximately 2001. This employment follows a 20-year active duty career in the U.S. military which often required him to be away from home for protracted periods of time. Applicant\u2019s term of military service 1 ended in August 2001. He has earned several certificates and licenses in his area of 2 expertise and he is lauded in his area of work. He is divorced and has no children. Applicant was married in December 1990. The couple lived in the city in which 3 Applicant was then stationed, although he maintained a permanent address of record in a different city within the same state. This permanent address was the address of a 4 friend. Applicant continued to use this permanent address after he started a five year 5 tour on a ship with a home port in a different state. His wife, however, did not join him 6 in the new state. Within two years, the couple was estranged. 7 In 1993, while their marriage headed to divorce, Applicant was ordered to vacate the couple\u2019s home in their original city and state of residence without time to organize and prepare for an orderly move back to his new port city.

On January 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on February 1, 2008, Applicant denied all allegations\nraised regarding three delinquent accounts; which he claimed were created without his\nknowledge and through fraudulent means. Applicant declined the opportunity to present\nhis case at a hearing. On February 14, 2008, however, Department Counsel requested\na hearing before an administrative judge pursuant to the applicable Directive. The case\nAugust 28, 2008\n\n Ex. 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated June 15, 2004) at 4.\n1\n Tr. 45.\n2\n Id. at 3.\n3\n Tr. 29-30. Applicant would use the latter address from 1990 to 2003 as his address of record, although it was\n4\nan apartment belonging to a friend. Tr. 31.\n Applicant used this address as a reliable place to receive mail, \u201cto have a permanent residence, because\n5\nwe\u2019re moving all the time on the ship, always going out . . . . [and] I lived aboard the ship.\u201d Tr. 31-32. \n Applicant went on at least one subsequent tour on board a ship for a significant duration.\n6\n Tr. 30.\n7\n2\nwas originally assigned to another administrative judge and a hearing date of June 18,\n2008, set. The case was reassigned to me on July 10, 2008, for caseload\nconsiderations. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a August 13, 2008,\nhearing date, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 17, 2008.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits\n(Ex.), accepted into the record as Exs. 1-6 without objection. Applicant submitted 18\nexhibits, accepted as Exs. A-R without objection. Applicant gave testimony. No\nwitnesses were called. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 19, 2008. No post-\nhearing materials were offered. The record was closed on August 20, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old Merchant Marine who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor as a marine engineer since approximately 2001. This employment\nfollows a 20-year active duty career in the U.S. military which often required him to be\naway from home for protracted periods of time.  Applicant\u2019s term of military service\n1\nended in August 2001.  He has earned several certificates and licenses in his area of\n2\nexpertise and he is lauded in his area of work. He is divorced and has no children. \nApplicant was married in December 1990.  The couple lived in the city in which\n3\nApplicant was then stationed, although he maintained a permanent address of record in\na different city within the same state.  This permanent address was the address of a\n4\nfriend.  Applicant continued to use this permanent address after he started a five year\n5\ntour on a ship with a home port in a different state.  His wife, however, did not join him\n6\nin the new state.  Within two years, the couple was estranged. \n7\nIn 1993, while their marriage headed to divorce, Applicant was ordered to vacate\nthe couple\u2019s home in their original city and state of residence without time to organize\nand prepare for an orderly move back to his new port city. Among the items left behind\n\n Tr. 20.\n8\n Tr. 21.\n9\n Tr. 17.\n10\n Tr. 29.\n11\n Although the credit reports demonstrate inaccuracies on these accounts, as referenced in note 15 infra, the\n12\naccounts were apparently opened in 1999. \n Tr. 20-21.\n13\n Ex. 6 (Judgment Abstract, issued August 28, 2000); Tr. 32-33.\n14\n Id.; Tr. 45.\n15\n As noted by Department Counsel, \u201cThere is a Federal Statute, and it\u2019s called the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Relief\n16\nAct, and it bars entry of a judgment against an individual unless the moving party has established that they\nin fact are not burdened by military service and unable to defend. And I would submit . . . service was not\nprovided to [Applicant] at a proper address, and for them to declare that he was not in military status, well\nyou\u2019ve got [evidence Applicant was then in active military service] until [the] 31  of August 2001.\u201d Tr. 45.\nst\nTr. 33.\n17\n3\nwere the two civilian credit cards Applicant had in his name.  In his absence, Applicant\u2019s\n8\nwife entertained many individuals Applicant did not know.  By the time he was permitted\n9\nto return to the residence, he discovered that all of his personal possessions and\nrecords had been thrown away.10\nQuestionable credit card activity first occurred around the time Applicant was\ndivorced in 1994.  At some other point, in the late 1990s, two credit card balances in\n11\nApplicant\u2019s name reached a delinquent level of about $4,000 each.  He concluded that\n12\nhis credit card information had been stolen during his estrangement and fraudulently\nused.  He provided the creditors with affidavits and other information contesting the\n13\ndebts as not being his. Assuming the debts had been accrued through fraud, Applicant\nthought his actions would clear up the matter. He never again heard from the creditors. \nOn August 3, 2000, however, those creditors pursued the two account debts\nthrough the courts. The two judgments at issue in the SOR, allegations 1.a-1.b, were\nsecured by the creditor and purportedly served on Applicant at his address of\npermanent record.  Those judgments indicate that during the proceedings,\n14\nDeclarations of Non-Military Status were filed by the plaintiff against Applicant in July\n2000 and in April 2001.  At those times, however, Applicant was actively serving in the\n15\nmilitary  and serving on a ship with a home port in a different state than the one noted\n16\nin his permanent address. Applicant was unaware of any attempt to serve him with any\njudgments. His friend at the address he used as a permanent address never advised\nhim of any attempts to serve him, despite the fact they maintained contact through\nabout 2002 or 2003.  \n17\n\nThe proffered credit reports muddle, rather than clarify the judgment amounts at issue. For example, Ex. 4\n18\n(credit report, dated August 2006), notes case number ending -802 for $4,538 twice, indicating it comes from\ntwo different court numbers and  duplicate entries for case number ending -976 for $3,369 similarly indicate\nthat they come from two different courts. More reliably, Ex. 6 (Judgment Abstract) reveals two judgments for\n$4,889.73 for case number ending -802 and $3,980.44 for case number ending -976.\n Tr. 22.\n19\n Tr. 20. \n20\n Tr. 23, 35-36.\n21\n Tr. 21.\n22\n Ex. 2 (DOHA Request for Additional Information, dated April 26, 2007, and responses notarized on May 24,\n23\n2007).\n Tr. 26. This utility account is noted in the SOR under allegation 1.c. It was opened in 2005 and is not\n24\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s property. \n Tr. 24.\n25\n Tr. 25.\n26\nOn  Ex. A (Identity cards); Tr. 40-41.\n27\n4\nIn about 2004, Applicant learned there was derogatory information on his credit\nreport. Specifically, a military credit card with a large balance and two 2000 judgments\narising from the credit card balances he assumed had been previously resolved.18\nApplicant paid off his larger balance to the military credit account in full, but contested\nthe judgments by telephone.  He still had no knowledge of who made the charges on\n19\nthese credit cards.  Indeed, Applicant was previously unaware of these judgments, not\n20\never having received any paperwork regarding the proceedings and not ever having\nreceived anything forwarded from his permanent address of record.  Applicant again\n21\nexchanged affidavits with the creditors. He sent in copies of his signature and pointed\nout inconsistencies in the information supporting the transactions, such as a number\nbeing slightly wrong for what appeared to be a check of his driver\u2019s license.22\nApplicant\u2019s current testimony regarding these affidavits and his efforts regarding these\ntwo alleged debts remains consistent with his May 2007 answers to DOHA\ninvestigators.  The last derogatory information of dubious origin arose in 2005, when a\n23\nutility bill with no nexus to Applicant\u2019s residence was reported as delinquent.  \n24\nTo help put an end to what he believes was on-going identity theft, Applicant\nhired someone to help straighten out his finances. She ultimately was fired for\nstealing.  He also sought assistance from the military when he was active duty, but his\n25\nefforts were ineffective.  In 1998, he replaced his driver\u2019s license and identity card to\n26\ndistinguish their numbers from those being used in conjunction with fraudulent activity.27\nBetween 2005 and 2007 Applicant\u2019s work evaluations rated him from above-\naverage to outstanding, each speaking of him in superlative terms with regard to his\n\n Exs. G-L (Applicant evaluations).\n28\n Ex. N (Letter of Superior); Tr. 48.\n29\n Ex. 2, supra, note 20.\n30\n Ex. M (Account statement, dated February 23, 2004).\n31\n5\nwork, reliability, and attention to detail.  His superior at work commends his\n28\nperformance.  He has had no current problems living within his means. A 2007\n29\npersonal financial statement indicates that his net monthly income of about $8,404 is\nmore than sufficient to cover his approximately $1,000 per month in expenses and debt\npayments.  The only other account noted in Applicant\u2019s credit reports suggesting an\n30\ninability to handle finances is his military charge card, which he fully and expeditiously\npaid off in 2004.  \n31\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n32\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n33\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n34\n Id.\n35\n Id.\n36\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n37\n6\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n32\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n33\n34\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n35\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n36\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n37\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n38\n7\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n38\nunder this guideline.  \nIn the 1990s, while mostly serving aboard a military ship, Applicant acquired\nsome delinquent debt on his military charge card and some delinquent accounts or\njudgments ultimately appeared on his credit bureau report. Such facts are sufficient to\ngive rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nAppellant to overcome the case against himr and mitigate security concerns. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s estranged wife moved to end their marriage, Applicant was left\nwith little time to remove his belongings from their home, located in a state distant from\nhis current military assignment. Left behind were his personal effects, papers, and two\ncredit cards. For the next decade following their estrangement, several questionable\nentries appeared on his credit report. Knowing he was not responsible for these\naccounts, he properly reported them as incidents of fraud perpetrated by unknown\nparties lacking authority to use his credit or name. Given these facts, Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 2, AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.\nFraudulent use of Applicant\u2019s identity and credit appears to have first taken place\nin the early to mid-1990s. Through his personal efforts with creditors and the issuance\nof new identification documents, no new occurrences have since transpired. The last\nquestionable item to appear on his credit report was from a 2005 delinquent household\nutility having no nexus to his home. Applicant has no current contact with his ex-wife or\nher cohorts, and he is now mindful of how easily credit fraud may be perpetrated. There\nis no evidence establishing he is responsible for the two judgments and the utility bill at\nissue in the SOR, and it appears unlikely he even knew the two judgments had ever\nbeen pursued. Nothing in these facts indicates a lack of diligence, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness, or shows Applicant cannot handle his money Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) applies. \nAlthough not an issue herein, Applicant did show that his financial history is\ngenerally positive and that he honorably repaid the one account he acknowledges as\nhaving briefly become delinquent, his military card. He has also explained the measures\nhe took to clear up the unknown accounts on his credit report, and to inhibit any further\nattempts to steal his identity. Such actions give rise to FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d), (the\n\n8\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts) and FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control) apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a regarded employee in his current capacity and has 20 years of\nlauded military service. He is a highly credible man who gave forthright testimony\nregarding his troubled marriage, the circumstances giving rise to his belief he has been\na victim of identity theft and fraud, and his highly transient lifestyle in the military from\nthe time of his 1990 marriage until his 2001 discharge. His depiction of his efforts over\nthe years to address and remove the two accounts which ultimately became judgments\nagainst him has been consistent. Similarly, his demonstration that a utility bill has no\napparent nexus to his home was persuasive. \nApplicant has shown his ability to pay off his debts and to live within budget.\nIndeed, his finances indicate his debts and expenses are but a minor percentage of his\nmonthly net income. Despite the presence of these three dubious debts on his credit\nbureau report, Applicant has otherwise mitigated security concerns regarding his\nfinancial situation that might tend to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, or otherwise raise questions about his\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Indeed, he has\ndemonstrated not only his financial ability to address his validly acquired obligations,\nbut his efforts to do so with regard to his military charge card.\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s persuasive argument that he was the victim of identity\ntheft and fraud is echoed by Department Counsel\u2019s suggestion that Applicant was also\ninaccurately portrayed in the proceedings which resulted in the two judgments at issue.\nCourt paperwork reflects that inaccurate representations were made that Applicant was\nnot an active member of the U.S. armed services at the time. That paperwork also\n\n This is particularly true given the provisions of the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Relief Act.\n39\n9\ninaccurately indicates Applicant was personally served at an address far from where he\nwas then on military assignment. Such inaccuracies arose through no action or inaction\nby Applicant and bring into question whether these cases should ever have proceeded\nto judgment in the first place.  Consequently, they do not necessarily bear unfavorably\n39\non Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information. With security concerns mitigated,\nI conclude it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Clearance is granted.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant is a 32-year-old computer support technician employed with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the defense contractor since April 2004. He has associates degrees in electrical engineering and computer networking. He recently married on June 7, 2008, and has one step-son, age 2. (Tr at 48-49; Gov 1.) Applicant has a history of marijuana use beginning in high school. Applicant used marijuana an average of two to three times a month while in high school. He estimates that his total use of marijuana was a couple of hundred times from the time he started using marijuana to the last time he used marijuana in 2006. (Tr at 44, 62-63.) He admits to purchasing marijuana on at least one occasion for his personal use. He was not involved in the manufacture or distribution of marijuana. (Gov 2.) Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in August or September 2006. Applicant could not recall the exact date. It occurred a few weeks after his birthday which is in mid August. He was at a party. A marijuana joint was being passed around. He took a couple puffs off the joint. Prior to his use in 2006, Applicant testified that to the best of his recollection, the last time he used marijuana was in 1997 or 1998. (Tr at 54-55, 63- 65; Gov 2.)

On March 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 5, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 3, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2008. On August 13, 2008, a Notice \nof Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for September 9, 2008, and was held on \nthat date. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel called four witnesses, including the \nApplicant, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A - B, which were admitted without \nOctober 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nobjection. The record was held open until September 23, 2008, to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted a one page document which \nwas admitted as AE C. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE C is marked as Hearing \nExhibit 1. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on September 18, 2008. Based upon \na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old computer support technician employed with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance.  He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since April 2004. He has associates degrees in \nelectrical engineering and computer networking. He recently married on June 7, 2008, \nand has one step-son, age 2. (Tr at 48-49; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant has a history of marijuana use beginning in high school. Applicant used \nmarijuana an average of two to three times a month while in high school. He estimates \nthat his total use of marijuana was a couple of hundred times from the time he started \nusing marijuana to the last time he used marijuana in 2006. (Tr at 44, 62-63.) He admits \nto purchasing marijuana on at least one occasion for his personal use. He was not \ninvolved in the manufacture or distribution of marijuana. (Gov 2.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in August or September 2006. Applicant \ncould not recall the exact date. It occurred a few weeks after his birthday which is in mid  \nAugust. He was at a party. A marijuana joint was being passed around. He took a \ncouple puffs off the joint. Prior to his use in 2006, Applicant testified that to the best of \nhis recollection, the last time he used marijuana was in 1997 or 1998. (Tr at 54-55, 63-\n65; Gov 2.) In response to question 24(a) on his security clearance questionnaire, he \nlisted that he last used marijuana at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in 2000. (Gov 1.) He does \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr at 66.) After the hearing, Applicant \npresented a signed, statement of intent to refrain from illegal drug use with the \nacknowledgement that any future use of illegal drug use would result in the automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance (if granted). (Tr at 66-67; AE C.) \n \nBetween age 19 and 23, Applicant was arrested on four occasions. In 1995, he \nwas arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. The charges were \ndismissed. In 1996, he was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug \nparaphernalia. Adjudication was withheld. In 1997, he was cited for possession of \nmarijuana. Adjudication was withheld. On each occasion that he was arrested for \nmarijuana possession, the amount of marijuana possessed was less than 20 grams. In \n1999, he was arrested for driving under the influence. The charge was reduced to \nreckless driving. (Tr at 49-52; Gov 2; Gov 3.)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n Applicant testified he never tried to keep his arrests secret from his parents. He \ndisclosed his arrest history on his security clearance application. He disclosed his 2006 \nmarijuana use to the investigator conducting his background interview in July 2007. He \nno longer uses illegal drugs and admits to using bad judgment when he last used illegal \ndrugs in August/September 2006.  He states that he has made a big life change. He \nunderstands the importance of responsibility and wants to progress in his career in \norder to provide for his new family. He bought a house in 2007 and is current on his \nmortgage payments. He no longer associates with people who use marijuana. His wife \ndoes not tolerate drug use. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future and \nunderstands that if he does so he could lose his security clearance (if he is granted \none), his job, and possibly his wife and stepson. (Tr at 51-54, 57-60, 66; Gov 2.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father testified. He served as a pilot in the United States Air Force. He \nis a Vietnam veteran and served in the reserves. He retired from the reserves in 1996. \nHe is currently a corporate pilot. He is aware of his son\u2019s past arrest history and issues \nwith drug use. He states that his son is a good kid who just did not seem to learn.  He \nlectured his son each time he was arrested. He blames part of the problem on his son\u2019s \nfriends whom he believes were a bad influence. He does not believe that his son has a \ndrug or alcohol problem. He noticed a change in his son. He is more responsible. He \nhas a good work ethic. He is newly married and purchased a home. He is keeping his \npersonal affairs in order.  He is disappointed in his son for his 2006 drug use but is \nproud that he told the truth during his security clearance investigation. (Tr at 34-46.) \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s co-workers testified. The first co-worker has worked for the \ndefense contractor for over 23 years. Applicant works as a contract employee in his \ndivision. He has worked with Applicant on a daily basis for five years. He never noticed \nApplicant to have an alcohol or drug problem. He does not believe Applicant is an \nunreliable risk to national security. He is aware of his company\u2019s policy of no illegal drug \nuse. (Tr at 17-25.) The second co-worker testified that he has worked with Applicant on \na daily basis since 2006. He describes Applicant as a superb co-worker. He has no \nconcerns about Applicant having access to classified information. He has never \nobserved him to have a drug problem. (Tr at 25-32.)   \n \nThree additional colleagues wrote letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  They describe \nApplicant as \u201cprofessional and diligent,\u201d \u201cpositive,\u201d and \u201cresponsive and dedicated\u201d to \nhis work. (AE A; AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \n\n \n5 \n \n \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, \nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar \nsubstances. AG \u00b6 24(a). \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction. AG \u00b6 24(b). \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) & 25(a) (any drug \nabuse) and DI DC \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant admits to illegally using marijuana on hundreds of \noccasions especially during his high school and college years. He was arrested on three \noccasions for marijuana possession and the possession of drug paraphernalia. He \nadmits to purchasing marijuana for his own personal use.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Two apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Drug \nInvolvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) applies. While Applicant used marijuana on a regular basis when he was \nyounger, he stopped using marijuana on a regular basis over eight years ago. \nAdmittedly, he demonstrated extremely poor judgment when he used marijuana in 2006 \nwhile at a party. He was 30 years old, employed with a defense contractor, and had \nrecently applied for a security clearance.  However, he has not used marijuana since \nthat incident. More than two years have passed since his last use of marijuana. He \nrecently married and has become more mature and responsible.  \n \n \nThe second mitigating condition that applies is FC MC & 26(b) (a demonstrated \nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using \nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with \nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation.) Applicant does not intend to use \nmarijuana ever again. He no longer socializes with his friends who used marijuana. His \nnew wife does not approve of illegal drug use. He has not used marijuana for two years. \nHe signed a statement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use and acknowledges that \nany future use will result in the automatic revocation of his security clearance. While \nApplicant\u2019s past drug abuse raised security concerns, particularly his marijuana use in \n2006, he has taken sufficient steps demonstrating that he does not intend to abuse any \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndrugs in the future.  Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThe government established security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s past illegal \ndrug use and arrest history which includes a 1999 arrest for DUI.  The following \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information) applies. Applicant\u2019s arrest history to include \nhis 1999 DUI arrest raise questions about his judgment and willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. His history of marijuana use raises additional concerns. In his late \nteens and early twenties, Applicant was a habitual user.  His choice to use marijuana \nwhile at a party in 2006, further raises issues about his judgment.  He was employed \nwith a defense contractor and had recently applied for a security clearance.    \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group) applies. Applicant\u2019s past arrest and drug use history potentially \nmakes him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation or duress. His past conduct also \nmay affect his standing in his professional or community life.     \n \n \nThe Personal Conduct concern may be mitigated. The following Personal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n  \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) applies. While Applicant was a habitual marijuana user in the past, \nhe was not a regular marijuana user at the time he last used marijuana in 2006.  He had \nnot used marijuana for at least six years prior to that occasion. While Applicant used \nextremely poor judgment when he used marijuana in the August/September 2006 \ntimeframe, he fully disclosed this past use to the investigator conducting his background \ninvestigation in July 2007.  He has not used marijuana in over two years. Since that \ntime, he has purchased a home and started a new family. Testimony from his father and \nhis co-workers indicate that Applicant has become more reliable and trustworthy.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) applies.  Applicant fully disclosed \nhis arrest history and illegal drug use on his August 26, 2006, security clearance \napplication and during his subsequent interview with the investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation. His parents are aware of his past history of marijuana use \nand arrests.  He no longer uses marijuana and no longer associates with his friends \nwho use marijuana. His vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress due to his \npast marijuana use has been significantly reduced or eliminated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although Applicant\u2019s last use of \nmarijuana occurred around the time he completed his security clearance questionnaire,  \nhe fully disclosed his usage during his background investigation interview. While he \nshowed extremely poor judgment, he accepted full responsibility for his actions and \nmade no excuses for his behavior. Although he has a history of marijuana use, his last \nuse of marijuana occurred over two years ago. He appears to have matured since that \ntime. He purchased a home. He recently married and is responsible for providing \nsupport for his wife and stepson. He does not intend to use marijuana again and  \nunderstands that future illegal drug use will result in the automatic revocation of his \nsecurity clearance. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhile the Applicant\u2019s past conduct justified the concerns raised under Drug \nInvolvement and Personal Conduct, he has met his burden of mitigating the security \nconcerns arising under these guidelines. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On June 7, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 27,\n2008, Administrative Judge Kathryn M. Braeman granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Department Counsel submitted a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\nclearance decision under Guidelines E and J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings as to the Guideline E and J\nallegations:\nApplicant is 30 years old and has been a research analyst for a defense contractor since\nNovember 2004.  He completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) to obtain a clearance in\nNovember 2004.  Previously he worked as a linguist for other contractors and for the military.  He\nhas a total of eleven years service to the U.S.\nApplicant served in the U.S. military from 1996 to 2001, and was granted a clearance in\n1997.  He worked as a linguist for a Department of Defense (DoD) agency on special assignment\nfrom 2001 to 2003, and was honorably discharged in 2003.  His awards included a commendation\nfor \u201cexceptionally meritorious achievement as an integral member\u201d of an advance party, a Good\nConduct Medal for the period 1996 to 1999, a Military Excellence Award in 2000, and a Certificate\nof Appreciation in 2001.  He has maintained a clearance in his defense contractor job since 2003.\nApplicant received four Article 15s while in the military, but they were never part of his\nOfficial Military Personal File (OMPF).  He did not list them on his SCA because he was told they\ndid not need to be listed.  He disclosed them during a polygraph examination in order to give \u201call\nthe information\u201d he had.  His last Article 15 occurred in 1999.\nApplicant was convicted of seven speeding or traffic infractions between 1999 and 2005.\nThe three offenses that occurred in 2005 constituted a violation of his probation as to a 2004 offense.\nDuring a polygraph examination for a job at another DoD agency, Applicant admitted that\nin 2005 he had switched price tags at a department store on four occasions.  He was never arrested\nfor those incidents.\n\n3\nMultiple character references who had known Applicant for a lengthy period of time attested\nto Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. and/or his excellent job performance.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.   \nIn this case, the appeal issue relates to the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  We review matters of law de\nnovo.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\n\n4\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to the provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious and contrary to law because it does not consider relevant factors, does not articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its material conclusions, and fails to consider important aspects of the\ncase.  The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s arguments persuasive.\n  The Judge found that the government had met its burden under the Guideline E and J\ndisqualifying conditions, and that the security concerns were not mitigated under any specific\nmitigating conditions.  However, she then went on to favorably apply the whole person concept,\npointing generally to Applicant\u2019s good employment and service record, and his expression of\nremorse.  The Judge\u2019s decision in that regard was limited to several sentences.  It contained no\ndiscussion of the evidence in the context of the whole person factors and offered no analysis.\nDecision at 14 and 15.  \nMoreover, the Judge\u2019s favorable application of the whole person concept was predicated in\nlarge measure on her conclusion that the four Article 15s, seven traffic infractions, and four theft-\ntype offenses, which had occurred between 1997 and 2005, were \u201cminor\u201d incidents, that were \u201cout\nof character.\u201d  Id at 5, 14 and 19.  Given the record in this case, that conclusion is not sustainable.\nThe Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a reasonable\ninterpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category of incidents separately,\nthe Judge failed to consider the significance of the \u201cevidence as a whole\u201d and Applicant's pattern of\nconduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, 866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate\nevents may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation).  Under the\nwhole person concept, a Judge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge's piecemeal\nanalysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of \u00b6 E2.2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, with respect to the Guideline E and J allegations, Department Counsel has met\nhis burden of establishing that the Judge failed to consider an important aspect of the case and failed\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for her conclusions.  Her overall favorable decision under\nthose Guidelines is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple    \nMichael D.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: Applicant, 30 years old, has been a research analyst and linguist for a defense contractor in State #1 from November 2004 to present. Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in November 2004. 3 Previously he worked as a linguist for other contractors and for the military and has a total of eleven years of service to the U.S. For a brief period between these positions he sold automobiles. (Exhibit 1; TR 122-123, 130-140) Applicant served in the U.S. military from March 1996 to March 2001. He was granted a security clearance in 1997. Applicant worked as a linguist for a DoD agency on special assignment from 2001 to 2003. He was honorably discharged in 2003. (Exhibit 1; Exhibit G; TR 28-29; 115, 128-129, 141-142) In 1998 he received a rare commendation medal as an E2 because of his contributions to a military mission on a task force: he was commended for his \u201cexceptionally meritorious achievement as an integral member\u201d of an advance party. He received a Good Conduct Medal for his behavior from 1996 to 1999. He received a Military Excellence Award in April 2000. (Exhibits E, F; TR 29-30, 118) He received a Certificate of Appreciation in 2001. (Exhibit H; TR 31-32) He has maintained a security clearance in his defense contractor jobs from 2003 to present.

The SOR detailed reasons why the \nGovernment could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.1 \nThe SOR alleged specific concerns over Foreign Influence (Guideline B) in paragraph 1, \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) in paragraph 2, and Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) in \nparagraph 3 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2 issued on December 29, \n \n1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised. \n \n2 A copy of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines was sent with his Statement of Reasons \n(SOR). (TR 13) \nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  \nAs discussed below, clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of July 10, \n2007, where he admitted all of the allegations in paragraphs 1 and 2 and requested a \nhearing.  He did not respond to the paragraph 3 allegations. \n \n            Department Counsel submitted a Ready to Proceed notice on November 26, \n2007, and at the same time submitted a Memorandum for Administrative Notice with \nmultiple attachments on Egypt and related matters, such as patterns of global terrorism, \nwhich Applicant received.  (TR 12) Subsequently the case was assigned to me on \nDecember 3, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing issued on December 21, 2007, set the matter \nfor January 15, 2008.   \n \n            At the hearing Department Counsel said the government would not proceed on \nallegation 1.b. as Applicant\u2019s grandmother has died; the allegation was withdrawn. (TR \n13) He offered three documents (Exhibits 1-3) that were admitted into evidence without \nobjection.  He moved that the documents submitted for Administrative Notice be \nconsidered.  (Exhibit I; TR 22-23)  Applicant testified himself and called seven \nwitnesses, and offered ten documents (Exhibits A to J) which were admitted into \nevidence without objection.  The transcript (TR) was received on January 22, 2008. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts concerning \nEgypt. Department Counsel also provided supporting documents to show the basis for \nsuch facts.   \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took administrative notice \nof the facts under subheading \u201cEgypt\u201d of this decision, which are derived from the \ndocuments Department Counsel provided. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n            After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \n \nApplicant, 30 years old, has been a research analyst and linguist for a defense \ncontractor in State #1 from November 2004 to present. Applicant completed a Security \nClearance Application (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in November 2004.  \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nPreviously he worked as a linguist for other contractors and for the military and has a \ntotal of eleven years of service to the U.S.  For a brief period between these positions \nhe sold automobiles.  (Exhibit 1; TR 122-123, 130-140)    \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. military from March 1996 to March 2001.  He was \ngranted a security clearance in 1997.  Applicant worked as a linguist for a DoD agency \non special assignment from 2001 to 2003. He was honorably discharged in 2003.  \n(Exhibit 1; Exhibit G; TR 28-29; 115, 128-129, 141-142)  In 1998 he received a rare \ncommendation medal as an E2 because of his contributions to a military mission on a \ntask force: he was commended for his \u201cexceptionally meritorious achievement as an \nintegral member\u201d of an advance party. He received a Good Conduct Medal for his \nbehavior from 1996 to 1999.  He received a Military Excellence Award in April 2000.  \n(Exhibits E, F; TR 29-30, 118)  He received a Certificate of Appreciation in 2001.  \n(Exhibit H; TR 31-32)  He has maintained a security clearance in his defense contractor \njobs from 2003 to present.  (TR 7,142-144)   \n \nApplicant took university classes from 1996 to 1997 in State #2 but received no \ndegree.  He has not married.  (Exhibit 1; TR 6,129)   \n \nForeign Influence  \n \n            Applicant was born in Egypt and came to the U.S. when he was four years old.  \nExcept for one year when he went to school in Egypt for the ninth grade, all of his \nschooling has been in the U.S.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 1987 at the \nage of 9. He holds a U.S. passport.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 3; TR 113-114, 123-128)  He \nwas never a dual citizen of the U.S. and Egypt.  (TR 119) \n \nHis mother is a U.S. citizen who has worked in the U.S. government.  She is \nmarried to his father who is a U.S. diplomat. His father has a Top Secret/SCI security \nclearance.  For a period while his father was assigned to Syria, Applicant\u2019s mother lived \nwith her mother in Egypt in 2005 with the permission of the U.S. State Department.  Her \nmother had suffered four strokes and needed help.  His mother took care of his \ngrandmother until her death in January 2007.  (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 113-114)  \nApplicant\u2019s mother subsequently returned to live with her husband, who for a period in \n2007 was in the U.S. and now is assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Syria.  (TR 144-145) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a U.S. citizen who served ten years in the U.S. military and \nheld a security clearance; he continued to maintain his security clearance for \nsubsequent jobs.  He currently works for the U.S. Department of State and has had \nvarious assignments in countries in the Middle East.  (TR 113, 145-146) \n \nApplicant has two maternal aunts and two uncles who are citizens and residents \nof Egypt.  Another maternal aunt is a Egyptian citizen, who lives in the Netherlands.  \nOne aunt living in Egypt does administrative work in a courthouse. Another aunt living in \nEgypt works in the media and has been a broadcaster.  One uncle living in Egypt is a \nschool teacher, and the other is a professor at a university. The uncle employed at a \nuniversity has retired from the Egyptian Air Force; previously he received military \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \ntraining in the United States.  Applicant has always disclosed those links to his relatives \nin Egypt during the last eleven years while he has held a security clearance.  He has no \ncontact with them except when he visits Egypt and on holidays when he calls them. \n(Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 146-150, 168) \n \nApplicant got permission from the security officer at his place of duty before he \ntraveled to Egypt in 1996, June 2003, and August 2006.  He travels there to maintain \ncontact with his family in Egypt. (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 114, 122, 154-157)  His last trip \nto Egypt was in May 2007; he saw his aunts, and briefly saw one uncle.  (TR 148, 151) \n \nApplicant challenged the accuracy of documents submitted for Administrative \nNotice that suggest Egypt is a threat as Egypt has never attacked the U.S.  (TR 122) \n \nA DoD agency denied him a Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) security \nclearance in August 2005.  (Exhibit 3; TR 137)  In response to questions during a \npolygraph examination for a SCI clearance, Applicant made clear that, based on his \nexperience in intelligence assignments, he did not believe he would be allowed to work \non any material relating to Egypt.  He reached this conclusion based on his \nunderstanding of safeguards in the intelligence community.  (Exhibit 3; TR 151-151) \n Applicant challenged the accuracy of the statements he made about his family in Egypt \nas were reported in the Clearance Decision Statement.  He did not make a statement \nthat \u201che would contact his extended family if he came across information that would \nindicate a threat or danger to their safety.\u201d Instead, he had stated he would discuss any \nissues involving Egypt with his supervisor.  He has always put the military mission first.  \nHe would never reveal classified information.  His loyalty is exclusively to the U.S. \n(Exhibit 3; TR 152-153, 169-171) \n \nEgypt \n \nEgypt is a republic that obtained its independence from Great Britain in 1922. Its \npopulation is about 79 million, making it the most populous country in the Arab world \nand the second-most populous country in Africa. Egypt and the U.S. enjoy a strong and \nfriendly relationship based on shared mutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, \nrevitalizing the Egyptian economy and strengthening trade relations, and promoting \nregional security. Egypt remains a close military and strategic partner of the United \nStates. Egypt is a key partner in the search for peace in the Middle East and resolution \nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Egypt has never attacked the United States. However, \nEgypt has a poor human rights record and like the United States has been subject to \nterrorist attacks. Egypt is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive \neconomic information. Egypt is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected \ninformation. \n \nPersonal and Criminal Conduct \n \nPunishments are not permitted under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ) unless an offense against a punitive UCMJ article has been committed.  Thus \nall infractions punished under Article 15 are criminal offenses. The traffic violations, not \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \npunished under Article 15, UCMJ, are not criminal offenses, unless a particular \nmisdemeanor under state law is alleged and established. \n \nApplicant received a series of Article 15s while he was in the military but they \nwere never part of his Official Military Personnel File (OMPF)3 He did not list them on \nhis SF 86, as he was told they need not be listed.4 He had no intent to falsify.  He \ndisclosed them during a polygraph examination in order to give \u201call the information\u201d he \nhad.  He explained the background of his minor military infractions.  When he first \nentered the military as a linguist, he was on \u201cphase status,\u201d which meant he had to \ncomply with strict rules and guidelines.  His last Article 15 was in 1999 for a speeding \nticket on the military base where he was given restricted driving privileges and was not \nsupposed to drive on base.  When he drove again on base, his driving rights were \nsuspended for five years.  He was only 19 years old at the time of these incidents of \npoor judgment.  (Answer; TR 115-118, 119-120, 159-161, 166)  None of the Article 15s \nwere considered serious enough to significantly impede his progress and promotions in \nthe military. (TR 167)  He received multiple awards as detail above. \n \nApplicant also admitted a series of civilian speeding tickets where he has paid his \nfines and was put on probation. He subsequently violated his probation, committing an \nadditional offense.  (Answer; TR 116, 161-162)  He had other traffic violations since \nJune 2005 because he turned right on red when it was prohibited. He received another \nspeeding ticket, and he used a 24-hour HOV lane, when he was not eligible to do so.  \n(TR 162-163) His driver\u2019s license has never been suspended. He currently has no \nrestrictions on his license.  (TR 171) \n \nDuring his polygraph for a job at another DoD agency, Applicant admitted that in \n2005 he had switched price tags at a department store on four occasions. He was \nunemployed at the time, but offered that as an explanation, not as a defense.  He was \nnever arrested, but voluntarily disclosed the incidents in a polygraph examination.  \nTheft, is of course, criminal conduct.  (Answer; Exhibit 3; TR 120-121; 163-164, 167) \n \nApplicant stated that his positive accomplishments as a soldier and contractor \nemployee should outweigh these misdemeanors.  He has been given multiple awards \nand served in roles which he fulfilled as he was highly skilled and dependable.  (TR \n166-167) \n \nReferences \n \n            A site manager for a defense contractor where Applicant works reported that he \nhas known Applicant since February 2006 and served as his supervisor from April 2006 \nto present.  He stated he never observed any signs that Applicant was a security risk.  \nWhile he was born in Egypt and has relatives there, the supervisor observed that \u201che \nnever indicated any preference for Egypt or exhibited any signs of favoritism for his birth \n                                                          \n3 Army Records of nonjudicial punishment may or may not be designated for filing in the \nPerformance Fiche of the OMPF.

He worked on multiple \nprojects but never discussed these sensitive matters outside of the cleared space nor \nwith other members who had no need to know.  He always followed directives issued to \nhim.  When he disagreed, he would tell his supervisor but accepted the supervisor\u2019s \nauthority.  Thus he concluded that Applicant does not lack respect for authority.  In \nconclusion, he noted that Applicant \u201cutilized his language skills to make numerous \ncontributions to the United States government over the past 2 years.\u201d  His supervisor \nhighly recommended that his performance be credited.  (Exhibit I) \n \n            A military officer provided a commendation for Applicant as they served together \nwhile deployed to Iraq from February to July 2003.  He had daily contact with Applicant \nwho provided critical linguistic support during ground combat and other highly stressful \nand life threatening operations.  At all times he demonstrated a mature and professional \ndemeanor that belied his youth.  His conduct and performance were always outstanding \nand had a direct impact on, and contributed significantly to mission success.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s personal courage and selfless performance saved U.S. lives.  He concluded \nthat \u201chis loyalty, maturity, dedication, and professionalism are above reproach.\u201d  (Exhibit \nJ) \n \n            Mr. M, a retired military counter intelligence officer who has worked with \nApplicant for 18 months on a contract at his current employer observed that Applicant \nhas acted as a translator and interpreter for a counter intelligence field activity.  He was \nevaluated in 2006 and given a small raise as they were pleased with his performance.  \nHe testified that Applicant has acted responsibly on classified matters.  He is not \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor; he was two levels up in the company.  He stated it is \nhelpful for linguists to have contract with their birth country in order to maintain cultural \nand religious expertise.  He has known Applicant since August 2006 when he started \nmanaging this contract.  He stated that at the time of the hearing Applicant was on \nunpaid leave after the company discovered in January 2008 that his access had been \nsuspended.  They had previously not been advised by the government agency who \ndenied him access in August 2005.   (TR 38-51) \n \n            Mr. F, a work colleague and friend who supervised Applicant in fall 2002 on a \noverseas military project, testified on his behalf and concluded that his cultural \nbackground was an asset for their sensitive classified assignments during the period \nwhen Applicant worked on a military project for Mr. F. He worked as a special agent and \ntestified that Applicant was \u201cthe best contract analyst\u201d assigned as he had the language \ncapability, and also was very integrated into American and Government culture so he \nwas \u201cvery easy to work with.\u201d  He has acted responsibly on classified matters on a \nhighly sensitive assignment.  After they worked together they became friends.   He \nrecommended Applicant for a security clearance based on his experience as a counter \nintelligence officer and on their friendship (TR 53-56, 56-58, 58-59, 59-63) \n \n            Mr. L, who was in the military for 26 years and later worked in the civil service, \n has known Applicant for two and a half years since he\u2019s engaged to his god-daughter. \n Mr. L expressed that he had \u201cno suspicions\u201d over Applicant\u2019s loyalty.

Later he was Applicant\u2019s manager on a U.S. \nproject and supervised him for over a year.  He evaluated him as \u201coutstanding\u201d and \nfound him loyal to the U.S.  Applicant always conducted himself within the law. He was \nalways willing to deploy and was committed to a tough mission.  When he supervised \nApplicant, he recommended him for a salary increase based on his performance.  (TR \n72-75, 75-80, 80-82) \n \n            Mr. S. is a linguist and intelligence analyst who met Applicant when they were in \nmilitary training together over 12 years ago.  They never worked together on missions \nas they specialized in different languages.  He views Applicant as loyal to the U.S. In \nthe time he\u2019s known Applicant he was seen that he always does the work assigned and \nis the first to volunteer on missions.   (TR 83-85, 86-89, 89-92) \n \n            Ms. L., who is a certified facility security officer, now works for a contractor for a \nfederal agency as a security clearance adjudicator.  Altogether she has twelve years of \nmilitary and government experience.  She has known Applicant since 2001 when she \nwas his supervisor.  She assessed Applicant as being loyal to the United States.  When \nshe supervised Applicant as his program manager, she believed he was \u201cone of the \nexceptional workers\u201d out of 30 linguists that she supervised.  The customers were very \nsatisfied with his performance and he received letters of appreciation. She highly \nrecommended him.  (TR 93-95, 95-104) \n \n            Mr. T., who has been a close friend for twelve years, met him at the military \nlanguage school in 1996 or 1997.  Mr. T. has experience both in the military and with a \ndefense contractor.  He sees him on a daily basis and assesses Applicant as loyal to \nthe U.S.  (TR 105-108, 108-110)     \n \nPolicies \n \n            Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in \nevaluating an individual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  In deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to \nclassified information, the mere presence or absence of any adjudication policy \ncondition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in \nevaluating this case, I weighed the relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines, and \ndetermined the following security concern was relevant to my determination: \n \nForeign Influence \n \n           Paragraph 6 of the adjudicative guidelines describes foreign influence security \nconcerns:   \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n           Paragraph 15 of the adjudicative guidelines sets out personal conduct security \nconcerns:   \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n           Paragraph 30 of the adjudicative guidelines expresses the security concern \npertaining to criminal conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to \ndemonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \napplicant's access to classified information. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \n \n5 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable \nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of \npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his \nburden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, \na decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after \nan affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In \nreaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative \nJudge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and \nlogical basis in the evidence of record.   \n \n            Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security \nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d An adverse decision reflects \nthat an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of \nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \nParagraph 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case include: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that \nthe individual\u2019s access to protected information may involve unacceptable \nrisk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and, \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country. \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Egypt and his ties and communication with his aunts and an \nuncle, who live in and are citizens of Egypt raise security concerns under paragraphs \n7(a) and 7(b). (SOR 1.c. and 1.d.) None of the other disqualifying conditions under \nparagraph 7 apply. His maternal aunts and uncles either have worked or do work for \nvarious agencies of the Egyptian government. Also, Department Counsel presented a \nseries of documents for Administrative Notice to establish the concern that Egypt is a \nforeign country that presents a \u201cheightened risk\u201d because of the security environment in \nthe country even though they are an ally of the U.S. The mere possession of close \nfamily ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  His connections to his Egyptian relatives also \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close to \nraise a security concern about his potential desire to help his aunts and uncle by \nproviding sensitive or classified information.   \n \nOn the other hand, no security concerns are raised by the fact that Applicant\u2019s \nmother\u2019s time resided in Egypt in 2005 to nurse her ill mother as her residence there \nwas authorized by the U.S. State Department.  Applicant\u2019s father is a U.S. diplomat \nassigned to the Middle East; both of his parents now live in Syria on assignment for the \nState Department.   (SOR 1.a.)  The allegation over his ties to his grandmother in Egypt \nwas withdrawn as she has subsequently died.  (SOR 1.b.)   \n \nWhile I have considered these security concerns, I conclude Applicant has \npresented evidence to partially meet the burden of mitigating those circumstances under \nthe mitigating conditions (MC) outlined in the revised guidelines. \n \nParagraph 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nParagraphs 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely \n[he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his aunts \nand an uncle] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close \nrelationships with his Egyptian family members could potentially force him to choose \nbetween the United States and his Egyptian family members. He did not meet his \nburden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships] could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nParagraph 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d He has lived in the United States for all \nbut the first four years of his life. He served on active duty in the Army for five years, \nand served the U.S. government overseas in combat. His father served for 10 years in \nthe U.S. Army and currently works overseas for the Department of State. Applicant is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen who was educated here.  Given Applicant\u2019s deep ties to the \nUnited States, there is no credible evidence that he would have any motivation to put \nthe interests of his relatives in Egypt over the interests of the United States.   \n \nIndeed he has demonstrated repeatedly that he made substantial and life-saving \ncontributions when he volunteered for important U.S. missions. While he might have \nsuggested otherwise in a polygraph interview where he disclosed his ties to his \nrelatives, I conclude that he was credible when he questioned the accuracy of the \nStatement in Exhibit 3.  No formal statement was taken during the polygraph that he \nhad an opportunity to review for accuracy.  Further, he made clear that the issues he \nraised over his ties to his relatives there were in the nature of a disclosure (and in \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nrecognition that counter intelligence would disqualify him from sensitive work involving \nEgypt), and not to suggest he would actually be responsive to foreign influence.   \n \nParagraph 8(f) partially applies because he has no interest in property in Egypt, \nand his property is in the United States. Although these two mitigating conditions are \npartially applicable, they are insufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns.  The foreign interest security concerns are fully mitigated under the whole \nperson concept, where his strong character references and his service to the United \nStates in combat receive their proper weight and consideration.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nParagraphs 16(c), 16(d)(1) and 16(e)(1) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines \nprovide for three potentially disqualifying conditions, which may be applicable to this \ncase: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of. . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and, \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s military and \ncivilian personal misconduct from 1997 to 2005.  Traffic violations, offenses punished \nunder Article 15, UCMJ, driving on post, while his on post driving privileges were \nsuspended, and theft by changing price tags are all rule violations (and some are \ncriminal offenses).  Moreover, such conduct, if known, adversely affects one\u2019s personal, \nprofessional and community standing.  \n \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nWhen Applicant was initially in military service from 1997 to 1999, he engaged in \na series of minor criminal violations of the UCMJ and received Article 15s to punish his \nconduct. 6 He also has had a series of traffic related offenses from 2003 to 2007 for \nspeeding.  He was placed on probation in 2004 and again was arrested for traffic \nviolations and was found to have violated probation in March 2005 and in January \n2005.  He recently was again arrested for minor traffic offenses.  Most importantly, he \nvoluntarily admitted that he switched price tags on items at a store in order to save \nmoney. Thus, the acts alleged in SOR paragraph 2 establish Paragraphs 16(c), 16(d)(1) \nand 16(e)(1) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Personal Conduct.   \n \nParagraph 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n \n6 Arguably, AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) does not apply to the Article 15 offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.d, the \nviolation of Article 92, UCMJ in SOR \u00b6 2.e, and the thefts in SOR \u00b6 1.l, because this criminal conduct \ncould have been alleged, and was alleged under Guideline J. Moreover, the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.e is partially mitigated under AG \u00b6 16(c) because it happened over seven years ago under \nunique conditions (while Applicant was on active duty), and as such the conduct is unlikely to recur. \nHowever, the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e cannot be considered piecemeal. The Judge is required \nto evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an \napplicant\u2019s conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When the active duty misconduct is considered in connection with \nthe 2005 misconduct, the personal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e cannot be fully ted under AG \u00b6 \n16(c). The misconduct on active duty continues to cast some doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, and may only be mitigated under the \u201cWhole Person Analysis,\u201d infra. \n \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nThe SOR does not allege that he falsified any documents.  He has admitted all of \nthe conduct alleged in SOR paragraph 2.  He did not associate with persons involved in \ncriminal activity. Thus, paragraphs 17(a), 17(b), 17(f) and 17(g) are not applicable.  \n \nParagraphs 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are partially applicable. The offenses are all \nrelatively minor. The majority of the offenses occurred from 1997 to 2003. There were, \nhowever, seven offenses in 2005.  He switched price tags on four occasions (a \nshoplifting or theft-type offense). The other offense involve misuse of his vehicle: he \nspun the wheels on his vehicle; he was speeding; he made an illegal left turn, and failed \nto display his registration; and his traffic violations violate his driving probation. The \noffenses at this point are probably somewhat unique, as they have not recurred, and he \nnow recognizes the security and employment impact of such conduct. They do not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because they are \nunlikely to recur. Applicant has \u201cacknowledged the behavior\u201d and recognized the \nnegative consequences of such conduct. Based primarily on the lack of misconduct \nafter June 2005, I conclude he has matured and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \nFinally, he has reduced or eliminated \u201cvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress\u201d through disclosure of his misconduct to security officials (especially the four \nthefts, even though there was no criminal record of such conduct).  He expressed regret \nfor this misconduct and presented character evidence to establish that this misconduct \nwas out of character. \n \nAlthough Applicant did not mitigate his conduct under the specific mitigating \nconditions in paragraph 17, he has presented sufficient evidence to meet the burden of \nmitigating those circumstances by the whole person analysis discussed below.  See n. \n6, supra. The whole person analysis is the portion of this decision where his \ncommendations, awards and service in a combat zone can be fully weighed and given \nappropriate consideration.   \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nParagraphs 31(a) and 31(c) set forth two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying, \u201cmultiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d   \n \nAn Article 15, UCMJ offense, as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.d, and the violation of \nArticle 92, UCMJ in SOR \u00b6 2.e, violate the punitive articles of the UCMJ, and as such \nare criminal offenses. The thefts in SOR \u00b6 1.l violate state criminal law.  The fact that \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nnone of the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.e and 2.l, resulted in criminal charges or a \nconviction is not dispositive under paragraph 31(c), which notes a possible security \nconcern without formal, prosecution of the offense.  I therefore conclude that   \nparagraphs 31(a) and 31(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.e and 2.l, \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \u2013 31(c) do not apply. Though he was never arrested, Applicant\u2019s \nfour thefts occurred in 2005, which is somewhat recent. It casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. He was not pressured or coerced \ninto committing the offenses. He admitted the offenses, and the offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nto 2.e and 2.l, are substantiated.  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d) partially applies. There is some evidence of successful rehabilitation, \nincluding the passage of about 2-3 years, depending on when in 2005 he committed the \nthefts, without recurrence of criminal activity. He expressed his remorse. He has \nreceived some job training, and has an outstanding employment record serving in Iraq. \nHowever, his post-offense behavior is insufficient to fully mitigate the multiple acts of \nmisconduct in this case.  Security issues are more appropriately resolved in this case \nunder the \u201cwhole person analysis\u201d which permits a broad review of all relevant \ncircumstances. \n  \nWhole Person Analysis \n \n           I evaluated Applicant under the whole person adjudicative process guidelines \nunder paragraph 2(a):   \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \nThe Appeal Board previously recognized the importance of combat service on \nbehalf of the United States, as well as strong connections to the United States in \nmitigating foreign influence security concerns, sustaining approval of a clearance in \nISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006).  That Appeal Board decision \nstates in pertinent part:  \n \nIn her whole person analysis in this case, the Administrative Judge relied \non numerous unchallenged findings of facts which cumulatively support \nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Applicant has sufficiently strong ties \nto the United States to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns. \nApplicant has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 1998. His immediate \nfamily members (wife, child, mother, sister and two brothers) are legally \nlocated in the U.S., as are all of his financial ties. Applicant is a member \nan ethnic group that suffered under the Taliban, and he and his family are \nsupportive of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. Applicant has not sought to \ncontinue any ties to Afghanistan except to use his expertise as a translator \nto advance the interests of the U.S. Two Americans in Afghanistan \nprovided evidence for Applicant including a credible U.S. government \nofficial who viewed Applicant as invaluable in the war on terrorism in \nAfghanistan, and noted that Applicant had participated in interrogations of \nthe Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) and gathered information from ACM \ndetainees which developed a greater understanding of ACM activities to \nfurther support U.S. operations. Applicant was careful to follow all security \nguidelines while in Afghanistan. He did not tell his family where he was \nworking in Afghanistan in order to comply with security regulations, and he \ndid not attend his father\u2019s funeral in Afghanistan because his priority was \nmaintaining his security clearance. \n \nThe Administrative Judge also found, based upon the government\u2019s \nevidence, that Afghanistan had made great strides towards building \ndemocracy and rebuilding the country, that it had embraced democracy \nand pluralism in the context of Afghan and Islamic traditions, and that it \nhad reversed its long history of serious human rights abuses under the \nprevious regime. There were no findings that the government of \nAfghanistan possesses an aggressive or hostile intelligence/security \nprofile vis-a-vis the U.S., or is otherwise engaged in efforts to acquire \nclassified or sensitive economic information from the U.S. \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) (remanding \ndenial of security clearance because decision did not discuss combat service on behalf \nof the United States). Also, ISCR Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd. February 5, 2008) \naffirmed a decision to grant a clearance to an individual who \u201cput his life in danger on at \nleast one occasion to protect American lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d  \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nConsequently, the Board concluded that the Judge had articulated a detailed, rational \nexplanation for her favorable decision under the whole person concept and sustained it.  \nIn this case, Applicant has similarly put his life on the line and his military contributions \nhave been recognized by his civilian and military supervisors and by multiple military \nawards.  For example, a military officer who served together with Applicant while \ndeployed to Iraq from February to July 2003 attested that Applicant provided critical \nlinguistic support during ground combat and other highly stressful and life threatening \noperations.  At all times he demonstrated a mature and professional demeanor that \nbelied his youth.  His conduct and performance were always outstanding and had a \ndirect impact on, and contributed significantly to mission success.  Applicant\u2019s personal \ncourage and selfless performance saved U.S. lives.  He concluded that \u201chis loyalty, \nmaturity, dedication, and professionalism are above reproach.\u201d   In 1998 Applicant \nreceived a rare commendation medal as an E2 because of his contributions to a military \nmission on a task force: he was commended for his \u201cexceptionally meritorious \nachievement as an integral member\u201d of an advance party. He received a Good Conduct \nMedal for his behavior from 1996 to 1999.  He received a Military Excellence Award in \nApril 2000.  \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Egypt must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Egypt, as well as the dangers existing in Egypt.7 Egypt is a close \nmilitary and strategic partner of the United States. Egypt is a key partner in the search \nfor peace in the Middle East and resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Egypt has \nnever attacked the United States. However, Egypt has a poor human rights record and \nlike the United States has been subject to terrorist attacks. Egypt is not a known \ncollector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive economic information. Egypt is not known to \ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. \n   \nApplicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns over possible foreign \ninfluence raised by his visits to Egypt to see relatives as he did so only on a limited and \ninfrequent basis. He travelled with the permission of the military and defense \ncontractors.  Further, he did so in part because of a mission-related need to maintain a \ncultural understanding of the area, which was established by several of his witnesses \nwho know his responsibilities as a linguist. In addition, he always disclosed his foreign \nlinks to relatives in Egypt during the last eleven years while he has held a security \nclearance.  \n  \n \n7 In ISCR Case No. 04-02630, the Appeal Board remanded the decision granting a clearance \nstating: \n \n[T]he Judge\u2019s failure to make findings concerning the geopolitical situation within \nAfghanistan impairs his analysis, both of Guideline B and of the whole person. Therefore, \nwe remand the case to the Judge for a new opinion, under Guideline B and the whole \nperson. The new opinion should include a more detailed whole person analysis, which \ntakes into account the dangers existing in Afghanistan insofar as they have a bearing on \nthe potential for coercion. Also, as appropriate, it should detail and explain Applicant\u2019s \npertinent qualities, characteristics, and circumstances which are the basis for the Judge\u2019s \nultimate decision. \n\n \n18 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant's family ties to Egypt are his mother\u2019s brothers and sisters with whom \nhe has intermittent visits and holiday conversations. Applicant's close ties of affection to \nEgyptian citizens are limited. It is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States. Thus, despite the security concerns \nover Egypt\u2019s human rights record, and the possibility of terrorism, I conclude any risk \nwould appear to be low.  \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s witnesses praised his commitment to mission and his \nloyalty to the United States, as demonstrated during his military service and his duties \nwith a defense contractor.  Applicant has strong endorsements from supervisors and \nwork colleagues as to the high quality of his work, of his loyalty, and of his willingness to \nvolunteer repeatedly for sensitive and important missions that put the interests of the \nUnited States ahead of his own.  His linguistic expertise and cultural sensitivity is \ngrounded in his historic ties to Egypt and provide the context allowing him to be highly \neffective on military assignments.   \n \nSignificantly, Applicant is recommended for a security clearance by numerous \nmilitary and corporate officials who have known him for a substantial period of time.  His \nsupervisors, past and present, uniformly assess him as \u201coutstanding\u201d and being a \ndedicated, honest, loyal and responsible individual who has volunteered for important \nand challenging missions which led to American lives being saved.  \n \n            Looking at all of these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has overcome \nforeign influence security concerns.  Given his strong and lengthy ties to the U.S. since \nhe has lived in the U.S. since he was four years old and became a U.S. naturalized \ncitizen in 1987, his relationship to the United States clearly outweighs his relationship to \nEgypt. After review all of the evidence, I conclude, even if there were potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress on Applicant or his family members, he would \nmake the choice of acting in the best interests of the United States by reporting the \nattempted pressure or coercion to security officials. \n \n \nI also considered the personal and criminal conduct security concerns in my \nwhole person analysis.  He has matured, and except for minor traffic offenses has not \ncommitted any offenses or rule violations since 2005.  Based on all the facts discussed \nin the whole person analysis, I conclude the personal and criminal conduct is mitigated.  \n \n            Security clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's \nsecurity eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Contacts with citizens of \nother countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual \npotentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure through threats against \nthose foreign relatives.  Acts indicative of foreign influence warrant careful scrutiny.  \nAfter considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I \nconclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue \npressure on Applicant, so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I \nresolve SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d in Applicant's favor.   \n\n \n19 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and review of him as a whole person, I \nalso conclude that Guideline E, allegations 2.a through 2.l in favor of Applicant as they \nwere minor and are outweighed by the strength of his character evidence.   \n \nGiven the minor nature of the offenses, the government failed to establish \nsecurity concerns over criminal conduct, so I also conclude Guideline J, allegations 3 \nand 3.a favorably to Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n            After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process \nsection, I make the following formal findings: \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline B                                                   FOR APPLICANT \n            Subparagraph 1.a.:                                                 For Applicant \n            Subparagraph 1.b.:                                                 Withdrawn \n            Subparagraphs 1.c. to 1.d.:                \nFor Applicant \n  \nParagraph 2. Guideline E                                                    FOR APPLICANT \n            Subparagraphs 2.a. to 2.l.:   \nFor Applicant \n             \nParagraph 3.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid Kasanow, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in the U.K. and came to the U.S. with her family in 1972.  She renewed\nher U.K. passport in June 2004.  She became a U.S. citizen in June 2005, but she used her U.K.\npassport for a family trip to the U.K. in March 2006, because processing of her application for a U.S.\npassport was delayed.  She returned from the trip on an emergency U.S. passport.  When she learned\nher U.K. passport was an impediment to obtaining a clearance, she destroyed it.  Security concerns\nbased on foreign preference are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 16, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance.  On August 8, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny her a security clearance. This action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C,\nForeign Preference.\nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document, admitted the factual allegations, and\nrequested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on October 17, 2007, and heard on November 13,\n2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old president and chief operating officer of a subsidiary of a federal\ncontractor providing transportation services to various agencies of the U.S. government.  She has\nworked for her current employer since December 1986. She began as a customer service\nrepresentative and worked her way up to her current position, becoming president in June 2007.  She\nhas never held a security clearance.\nApplicant was born in the England and lived there until she came to the U.S. with her family\nin 1972, when her father was offered a job in the U.S.  Her parents, sister, and two brothers all live\nin the U.S. and do not intend to return to England. (Tr. 30, 32-33.)  Applicant has three aunts living\nin England.  Her uncle living in England passed away two weeks before the hearing (Tr. 34). She has\nseveral cousins in England but has contact with only one. (Tr. 34.)\nApplicant was educated in the U.S., obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree in education in August\n1985, and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in December 1995.  She became a U.S.\ncitizen in June 2005. (Tr. 36.)  She married a U.S. citizen in October 1996, and they have a nine-\nyear-old son and seven-year-old daughter, both native-born U.S. citizens.  Applicant is active in\ncommunity affairs, currently serving as vice-president of the local Boys & Girls Clubs, a member\nof the board of directors for the local zoo, and a board member of the local chamber of commerce.\n(Tr. 51-52.)\nApplicant\u2019s predecessor as president and chief operating officer has known her for about 20\nyears.  He described her as \u201csmart, hardworking and an excellent leader\u201d who is a \u201cstickler for\nquality and ethics.\u201d  He stated she has embraced the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d and takes great pride in being\na naturalized U.S. citizen. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A.)\n\n3\nThe president and chief operating officer of another subsidiary company, who has known\nApplicant since the early 1990s, stated she has \u201can extremely strong reputation, well-established\ncredibility with [their] customers, and is highly ethical.\u201d  In his view, her performance and\ndemonstrated personal character \u201care nothing short of phenomenal.\u201d  (AX B.)\nApplicant\u2019s financial advisor, who has known her and her husband since 2000, described her\nas extremely hardworking, honest, and trustworthy.  He stated Applicant \u201cthinks of the United States\nas her home country.\u201d  (AX C.)\nA government affairs representative of Applicant\u2019s employer has known Applicant for at\nleast ten years.  He stated she takes her company\u2019s compliance with the myriad of government\nregulations very seriously, and he believes \u201cshe could be expected to approach any obligations\nassociated with holding a security clearance with the same degree of personal commitment and\ngravity.\u201d  (AX D.)\nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer has known her for 16 years.  She regards Applicant as\nsmart, capable, an excellent leader, extremely conscientious, and a loyal American. (AX E.)\nApplicant renewed her U.K. passport in June 2004.  She became a U.S. citizen in June 2005,\nthe first in her family to apply for U.S. citizenship.  Her decision to become a U.S. citizen was based\non three factors.  \nThe first factor was her family situation.  She was married to a U.S. citizen.  Her children were\nU.S. citizens.  She had lived most of her life in the U.S. and was educated in the U.S.  She realized,\n\u201cI\u2019m more of a U.S. citizen certainly than I am a U.K. citizen.\u201d (Tr. 37.) \nThe second factor was her career.  When she learned she was likely to become president of\nthe company, she knew that it did a lot of government business, it would be difficult to run the\ncompany without a clearance, and she could not obtain a clearance without being a citizen. (Tr. 37-\n38.) \nThe third factor dealt with estate planning.  About two years ago, the family\u2019s financial\nplanner informed them that the family estate would be more difficult to handle if her husband\npredeceased her and she was not a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 39, 61.)  The convergence of these three factors\nconvinced Applicant that the time had come to apply for U.S. citizenship.\nWhen Applicant became a U.S. citizen, her immediate family members also began thinking\nabout becoming U.S. citizens.  Her sister is now a U.S. citizen, and one of her two brothers has\napplied for U.S. citizenship. (Tr. 33.)\nAt some time in 2004 or 2005, Applicant attempted to obtain U.K. passports for her two\nchildren because of their heritage.  The application was returned because the children did not have\nU.S. passports.  Applicant did not pursue the issue further.  (Tr. 71-72.)\nApplicant applied for a U.S. passport in early 2006 in preparation for a family trip to England\nscheduled for March 2006.  This trip was her first return to England since she came to the U.S. in\n1972.  (Tr. 39-40.)  Her passport application was sent to the passport office in New Orleans, which\n\n4\nwas still recovering from Hurricane Katrina.  (AX W.)  In spite of numerous telephone inquiries,\nApplicant had not received her passport by their scheduled departure date.  \nApplicant had organized the trip, paid for it in full, and felt responsible for it.  She decided\nto use her U.K. passport to travel to England and use her U.S. passport, when it arrived, to return to\nthe U.S.  She gave her administrative assistant a Federal Express envelope addressed to her uncle in\nthe U.K., and her assistant continued to pursue the passport application.  After two weeks, as\nApplicant was preparing to return to the U.S., she still had no U.S. passport.  She was informed by\nan airline representative that re-entering the U.S. on her U.K. passport was illegal, and she was\nadvised to obtain an emergency passport from the U.S. embassy.  Her family returned to the U.S.\nwithout her, she obtained her emergency U.S. passport, and she used it to return to the U.S.  (Tr. 40-\n44, 67.)\nWhen an investigator came  to her office around December 2006 and asked her if she would\nsurrender her passport, she responded, \u201cWell, no, you know, it\u2019s kind of my heritage and I would like\nto hold onto it.\u201d (Tr. 45, 70)  When Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in April 2007, she\nwas asked why she had a U.K. passport.  She responded: \u201c I was born in England and lived there until\nI was 9.  I feel that this is my heritage and I want to feel a part of it.  I am as American as my peers,\nbut feel this is a small way to hang onto my past.\u201d  (GX 2 at 2).  Applicant did not realize at the time\nthat the passport was a major obstacle to obtaining a clearance.  After talking with the corporation\nlegal counsel, she realized she had obligations to her family and her company in the U.S. and should\nnot allow her attachment to the symbol of her heritage stand in the way.  On November 7, 2007,\nApplicant destroyed her passport by shredding it in the presence of her facility security officer.  (AX\nE; Tr. 45.)\nApplicant continues to be a dual U.S.-U.K citizen.  When asked at the hearing if she would\nbe willing to renounce her U.K. citizenship, she responded, \u201cYes I would.  I mean, if that\u2019s what it\ntakes, absolutely.\u201d  (Tr. 48.)  She explained: \u201cI think, you know, when I look at it and I say, you know,\nI\u2019ve got a great job.  I\u2019ve lived in this country for as long as I have.  Certainly, you know, that\u2019s my\nheritage and it\u2019s a nice thing to hang onto that heritage if you will, but my home is in the United\nStates.\u201d (Tr. 48-49.)\nApplicant and her husband have all their assets in the U.S. (AX F-K.) They are financially\nsecure and have established college funds for their two children. (AX L and M.) They own a home\nworth about $300,000, with a mortgage debt of about $149,000.  (AX H; Tr. 49.)  Applicant\u2019s pay\npackage, including bonuses and stock options, ranges from about $400,000 to $550,000 per year. (Tr.\n87.)  Her husband is not employed outside the home. (Tr. 88.)\nAbout two weeks before the hearing, Applicant\u2019s uncle in the U.K. passed away, and\nApplicant learned that she and her three siblings would inherit his estate. (Tr. 52-53.)  There is no real\nestate involved, but she will share about 250,000 British pounds with her three siblings.  (Tr. 84.)\nApplicant intends to hand over whatever she inherits to her financial advisor to be invested for\nherself, her husband, and her children. (Tr. 85.)\nThe U.S. and the U.K. are close allies, with a long history of bilateral cooperation.  Their\nrelationship reflects their common language, ideals, and democratic practices.  (AX V at 6.)\n\n5\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the\napplicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance decision must be a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each specific\nguideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with the U.K. and the U.S.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges her possession of a current U.K. passport.  Applicant admitted both allegations.\nWhen the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the\nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App.\nBd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).  In this case, SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant\u2019s\n\n6\nexercise of dual citizenship and SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges the manner in which she exercised dual citizenship.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b merely describes the evidence supporting \u00b6 1.a, and, as such, it duplicates \u00b6 1.a.\nAccordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.b. in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n9.  Dual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security clearance decision.\nISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe\nissue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but rather whether an applicant shows a preference\nfor a foreign country through actions.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a\ncurrent foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  Applicant\u2019s possession of a U.K. passport and her use of\nthat passport in March 2006, after becoming a U.S. citizen in June 2005, raises AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).\nApplicant\u2019s inheritance from her uncle in the U.K. does not raise any enumerated\ndisqualifying conditions under Guideline C.  However, I have considered it as part of the whole\nperson analysis required by the AG \u00b6 2.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual citizenship\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(a).  Applicant was born\nof English parents in England.  She took no affirmative action to acquire English citizenship.  This\nmitigating condition is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  Applicant testified unequivocally\nthat she would renounce her English citizenship if it was required.  This mitigating condition is\nestablished.\nFinally, security concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be mitigated\nif \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  This mitigating condition was established when Applicant destroyed her\nU.K. passport in the presence of her facility security officer on November 7, 2007.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent\nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n7\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, very articulate, highly intelligent woman.  She entered\nthe U.S. as a child.  She was not a refugee from a repressive regime, but an immigrant from a friendly\ncountry with rich traditions similar to and compatible with those of the U.S.  Her attachment to her\nEnglish heritage and her reluctance to give up the indicia of that heritage are understandable.  The\nU.S. is a nation of immigrants, replete with celebrations of the heritage and cultural traditions of other\ncountries, such as the parades on Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, the celebrations of Bastille Day, the celebrations\nof the lunar New Year, and numerous local ethnic celebrations throughout the country.  By and large,\nthese celebrations do not reflect a preference for the \u201cold country.\u201d  Instead, they are merely ways for\nU.S. citizens to stay connected with their heritage.\nAs Applicant\u2019s career progressed and various family-related and professional factors\nconverged, she realized she could no longer keep one foot in England, and she needed to make a\nchoice.  With no hesitation, she became a U.S. citizen.  Some of her immediate family members\nfollowed her lead.  She kept her U.K. passport as a connection to her heritage, and briefly explored\nobtaining U.K. passports for her children for the same reason.  However, when it came time to travel\noverseas, she applied for a U.S. passport, evidencing her preference to travel as a U.S. citizen.  In\nMarch 2006, she was faced with the choice of canceling a long-awaited prepaid family trip to England\nor using her U.K. passport.  She used her U.K. passport and continued her efforts to obtain her U.S.\npassport.  This use of her passport was not a reflection of preference for the U.K., but was an\nexpedient measure to avoid canceling the trip and disappointing her family.  When her family\nreturned to the U.S., she remained behind to obtain an emergency U.S. passport.\nWhen Applicant was advised by her corporate counsel that her U.K. passport was an\nimpediment to a security clearance, she destroyed it, even though it was an indicium of her heritage.\nShe testified without hesitation or equivocation that she was willing to renounce her U.K. citizenship\nif it was necessary.  Her testimony at the hearing was plausible, credible, and very sincere.\nApplicant\u2019s inheritance from an uncle in the U.K. raises no issues of foreign preference.\nApplicant will not travel to the U.K. during the probate of her uncle\u2019s estate, and her share of the\ninheritance will be invested by her financial advisor in the U.S.  \nApplicant family and future are in the U.S.  She is professionally successful, devoted to her\nfamily, and deeply involved in her community.  She has demonstrated by her conduct that she regards\nthe U.S. as her home.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns based on foreign preference.  Accordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of showing\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n8\nParagraph 1. Guideline C (Foreign Preference):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is granted.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all the allegations. However, at the hearing he admitted most of the debts alleged. His admissions at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 45-year-old information security consultant employed by a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since March 2004. He served in the U.S. Army from July 1982 to June 1998. He qualified for an early retirement program and retired as a sergeant first class (pay grade E-7). His military specialty was in communications. He received a security clearance in 1994, while in the Army, and in August 1998, as a civilian contractor. He has worked for federal contractors since his Army service. He was married in July 1983 and has four children: a 27-year-old son from a previous relationship (Tr. 79); and three daughters from his current marriage, ages 23, 22, and 13 (Tr. 53). 3 An Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, who served with Applicant in Saudi Arabia for six months in 1992 and then remained in contact with him until the present, testified on his behalf. She testified they both worked in a classified environment (Tr. 33). She called Applicant \u201ca genius\u201d because of his ability. She trusts him unqualifiedly (Tr. 37- 38).

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Kenneth M. Roberts, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on July 19, 2004.  \nOn September 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E \n(Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 1, 2007; answered it on \nNovember 9, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on November 14, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on December 7, 2007.  The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2007. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2008, and an amended notice of \nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing on January 23, 2008, changing the time of the hearing at the request of \nApplicant\u2019s counsel, but not the date or place. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nJanuary 28, 2008. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented the testimony of two \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through Z, which were admitted \nwithout objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February \n8, 2008, to enable him to submit additional evidence.  Applicant timely submitted AX \nAA, BB, and CC, and they were admitted without objection.  Applicant\u2019s email \ntransmitting the documents is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.  \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s response to AX AA, BB, and CC is attached to the record as \nHearing Exhibit II.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 7, \n2008. The record closed on February 8, 2008.  Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the \nevidence by substituting the date \u201cJuly 19, 2004\u201d for \u201cJune 16, 2004 in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nand 2.b.  Applicant did not object to the amendment, and I granted the motion (Tr. 23-\n24). \n \nAuthentication of Report of Investigation \n \n \nGX 4 is a personal subject interview extracted from a report of investigation.  \nApplicant, represented by counsel, affirmatively waived the authentication requirement \nof Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 (Tr. 22-23).   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all the allegations.  However, at the \nhearing he admitted most of the debts alleged.  His admissions at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old information security consultant employed by a federal \ncontractor.  He has worked for his current employer since March 2004.  He served in \nthe U.S. Army from July 1982 to June 1998.  He qualified for an early retirement \nprogram and retired as a sergeant first class (pay grade E-7). His military specialty was \nin communications.  He received a security clearance in 1994, while in the Army, and in \nAugust 1998, as a civilian contractor.  He has worked for federal contractors since his \nArmy service.  He was married in July 1983 and has four children: a 27-year-old son \nfrom a previous relationship (Tr. 79); and three daughters from his current marriage, \nages 23, 22, and 13 (Tr. 53).   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAn Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, who served with Applicant in Saudi Arabia \nfor six months in 1992 and then remained in contact with him until the present, testified \non his behalf.  She testified they both worked in a classified environment (Tr. 33).  She \ncalled Applicant \u201ca genius\u201d because of his ability.  She trusts him unqualifiedly (Tr. 37-\n38).  In a written letter of support, she described Applicant as \u201cintelligent, motivated, \nfocused, purpose-driven and reliable.\u201d  She regards him as \u201can astute businessman, an \nexperienced engineer, a selfless, courageous soldier, . . . a devoted father, son, and a \nloyal friend.\u201d (AX C.) \n \n \nApplicant presented letters from nine additional character witnesses who have \nknown him as supervisors, coworkers and acquaintances.  Applicant solicited these \nletters and sent each character witness a sample letter, resulting in similarities among \nsome of the letters (Tr. 156).  The authors of AX D, E, G, H, I, and J had not seen the \nstatement of reasons and were unaware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems.  Applicant did \nnot disclose his financial situation to them because it was embarrassing (Tr. 157).  Only \nthe authors of AX C, J, and K knew about the allegations of falsifying the SF 86 (Tr. \n158).  The authors of AX D, E, F, G, K, and L describe him as conscientious about \nsecurity.  The authors of AX D, F, J, K, and L describe him as \u201ctrustworthy, dependable, \nand stable.\u201d  All regard him as a person of high character and considerable technical \nskill. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s oldest daughter testified and described Applicant as \u201ca good man\u201d \nand a caring father who takes care of the family financially.  She testified when he finds \nsomething wrong, he takes care of it as soon as he is able (Tr. 51-52).   \n \nSince 1998 Applicant has maintained two residences.  His family lives in the \nSoutheast U.S., and he has maintained a second residence near his workplace in the \nNortheast U.S. (Tr. 80).  He visits his family about every two weeks, sorts through the \naccumulated mail, and takes care of matters requiring his attention (Tr. 58).  As far back \nas his deployment to Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, his wife has been \u201csloppy and dilatory\u201d \nin managing the family finances, and their marriage has been \u201ctumultuous\u201d because of \nfinancial disagreements (AX A at 2-3; Tr. 150).  He testified he relied on his wife to take \ncare of the finances until 2005 or 2006, when he took over (Tr. 154).   \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was on a joint credit card account. The \nstatements were sent to his residence in the Southeast (Tr. 82).  Applicant believed his \nwife was making payments on the account, and he did not know the account was \ndelinquent until the security investigator showed him the credit reports (Tr. 82-83).  The \naccount has been closed and the debt paid in full (AX M; Tr. 147). \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b arose because Applicant did not pay state income \ntaxes in his Northeast residence.  His Southeast state of residence does not have a \nstate income tax.  He testified he was unaware that he was required to pay state income \ntaxes in the Northeast state (Tr. 83-84).  The delinquent taxes have been paid (AX N). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAbout two or three years ago, Applicant gave his middle daughter a car that \nturned out to be unreliable.  The middle daughter asked Applicant to cosign a loan for a \nnew car, and stopped making payments on the old car.  She did not tell Applicant the \nloan on the old car had not been paid off (Tr. 46).  A judgment was entered against \nApplicant, but he was unaware of it until he attempted to rent a car and found out his \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended (Tr. 90).  This delinquent debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, \nhas been paid off (AX P). \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s oldest daughter was involved in an automobile accident.  A \nlawsuit was filed against Applicant, the daughter, and the mother; and a judgment was \nentered against all three of them, but the daughter and mother did not inform Applicant.  \nThe judgment is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  The daughter erroneously believed her mother \nhad taken care of the incident (Tr. 47-49).  Applicant was unaware of the debt until he \nreceived a copy of his credit report from DOHA (Tr. 92). The judgment has been \nsatisfied (AX Q). \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were incurred when Applicant closed a \nbusiness but his telephone and broad band provider did not terminate service.  He \nlearned that the provider was continuing to charge him when the DOHA provided him \nwith a copy of his credit report (Tr. 101-02).  The two accounts have been settled (AX R, \nS, and AA-CC). \n \n \nThe medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a(1) arose when Applicant was treated for \nvertigo in January 2001. He received a bill from his doctor, and was involved in a \ndispute with his insurance company about it.  Eventually, he went to the doctor\u2019s office \nto pay it, but he found the office closed and a notice on the door stating the doctor had \ndied.  No contact information was posted (Tr. 138-39).  He decided to wait for a bill but \nnever received one from the doctor\u2019s office.  He told a security investigator he never \nheard from any collection agencies about the bill (GX 4 at 1).  However, at the hearing \nhe admitted he received a bill from a collection agency some time in 2003 (Tr. 139). He \nlearned the debt had been reported as delinquent when he received his credit report \nfrom DOHA (Tr. 104-06).  The debt has been paid (AX U). \n \n \nThe two delinquent payday loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a(2) and (4) occurred \nwhen Applicant paid the loans with a check that subsequently was dishonored because \nhis wife had drawn down the account without his knowledge (Tr. 121-22; 152-54).  Both \nloans have been repaid (AX U, X). \n \n \nThe medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a(3) was for psychological services after \nApplicant underwent serious abdominal surgery.  While he was recovering, he was \nengaged in conversation by the psychologist.  He later learned he was assigned a \npsychologist because of the seriousness of his condition. Applicant told the psychologist \nhe would not pay the bill because he had not asked for his services.  The psychologist \ntold him he would report the debt to the credit bureau, but Applicant refused to pay it as \na matter of principle.  He knew the debt would be reported as overdue, but felt it was \n\n \n5 \n \n \nunfair and refused to pay it (Tr. 122).  He paid the debt in April 2007, after he learned it \nwas a security concern (AX W; Tr. 110). \n \n \nApplicant has taken steps to minimize recurrence of his financial problems.  He \nclosed the delinquent joint credit card account and assumed responsibility for the family \nfinances. His daughters now have their own automobile insurance.  He has engaged \ncertified public accountants near each of his residences to handle his taxes.  He utilizes \non-line banking to monitor his accounts, and he has engaged two credit report \nmonitoring services (Tr. 125-28).   \n \n \nApplicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on July 19, 2004.  \nHe disclosed some potentially derogatory information, including consulting with a mental \nhealth professional and two traffic tickets in 2000 and 2004.  In response to question 38, \nasking if he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts during the past \nseven years, he answered \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed one $500 debt, but he did not disclose \nthe five debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a(1)-(4).  In response to question 39, asking \nif he was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debts, he answered \u201cno\u201d and \ndid not disclose the five debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a(1)-(4) (Government Exhibit \n(GX) 1 at 6).   \n \nThe debt disclosed on the July 2004 SF 86 was not alleged in the SOR.  It arose \nfrom a mortgage company\u2019s failure to credit Applicant with payments, and it was \nresolved in his favor (AX T). \n \nOn a previous SF 86 executed on May 29, 1999, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 38, but utilized the \u201cGeneral Remarks\u201d section and explained. \u201cI may have \nitems over 180 days but I am not sure as I cannot verify.\u201d  He also used the remarks \nsection to disclose two disputed debts and describe the circumstances of the debts and \nthe basis for the dispute.  (GX 2 at 11-12). \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not disclose the delinquent credit card account on his \nJuly 2004 SF 86 because he was unaware of it (Tr. 123).  He did not disclose the \ndelinquent medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a(1) on his SF 86 because he intended to \npay it, did not know it was reported as delinquent, did not know how many days it was \nlate, and did not know how to answer the question (Tr. 141).  He also testified he \ncompleted his SF 86 in a rush and did not have time to check his records (Tr. 146). \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not disclose the delinquent payday loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a(2) and 2.a(4), because he did not know the checks he uttered to repay \nthem had been dishonored (Tr. 124). Finally, he testified he did not disclose the \ndelinquent medical bill from the psychologist because he was disputing it (Tr. 124).  He \nadmitted knowing the debt was outstanding, but thought it was \u201cillegally outstanding.\u201d  \nHe knew the creditor considered the bill delinquent (Tr. 184).  He testified he believed \nhe could have successfully disputed it if he had the funds to hire a lawyer (Tr. 166-67, \n184-85). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the \ntable below. \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nCredit card \n$2,293 \nPaid in full, 1-22-08 \nAX M \n1.b \nState taxes \n$2,312 \nPaid in full, 11-1-07 \nAX N \n1.c \nMedical \n$63 \nPaid in full, 10-31-07 \nAX O \n1.d \nCar loan \n$5,200 \nPaid in full, 1-7-08 \nAX P \n1.e \nJudgment \n$6,538 \nResolved, 11-20-07 \nAX Q \n1.f \nTelephone \n$95 \nPaid in full, 11-2-07 \nAX R \n1.g \nTelephone \n$343 \nPaid in full, 11-2-07 \nAX S; AX AA-CC \n2.a(1) Medical \n$735 \nPaid in full, 4-27-07 \nAX U \n2.a(2) Payday Loan \n$698 \nPaid in full, 4-27-06 \nAX V \n2.a(3) Medical \n$250 \nPaid in full, 4-27-07 \nAX W \n2.a(4) Payday Loan \n$647 \nPaid in full, 4-27-06 \nAX X \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g alleges seven delinquent debts.  Applicant admitted all \nseven debts at the hearing and presented evidence showing they had been resolved. \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an Ainability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts.@  This condition is not raised for any of the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, because Applicant\u2019s failure to pay these debts was due to the \nfinancial disarray in his household, not an inability or unwillingness to pay them.  The \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a(3) was the result of Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to pay what he \nconsidered an unfair and illegal debt, but this debt was alleged only under Guidelines E \nand J. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is raised where there is Aindebtedness \ncaused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of \nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.@  This \ncondition is not raised because there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible \nspending. \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises this condition.   \n \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  This condition is not raised, \nbecause Applicant\u2019s spending was not beyond his means.   \n \nAG \u00b6 19(g) is raised by Afailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.@  Applicant\u2019s failure to file state \nincome tax returns raises this condition. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@  If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established, because most of the debts were \nnot resolved until recently. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established \nbecause Applicant had numerous delinquent debts.  The third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) \nis established, because Applicant has taken corrective measures to resolve his chaotic \nfamily finances.  The fourth prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt . . . .\u201d) is established for the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established for these debts.  \nThe impact of the debts alleged under Guidelines E and J on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment is discussed below. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established.  Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nfinancial neglect was a circumstance beyond his control.  However, he knew after his \ndeployment to Saudi Arabia in the 1990s that she could not be trusted with managing \nthe family finances, but he did not take over the finances or institute monitoring \nmeasures until around 2005.  Because he did not act responsibly for several years after \nhe learned of his wife\u2019s financial neglect, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@  AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant was unaware of the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g until a \nsecurity investigator showed him his credit report.  Although two of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.d) were resolved only days before the hearing, he began resolving his \ndelinquent debts in April 2006, long before the SOR was issued.  He has now resolved \nall the debts.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to list the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 2.a(1)-(4) on his SF 86 executed in July 2004.  The concern under this guideline \nis set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the \nomission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \n \nApplicant testified he was unaware of the two delinquent payday loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a(2) and (4) until after he executed his SF 86.  His testimony regarding these \nloans was plausible and credible.  Accordingly, I conclude he has refuted the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a(2) and 2.a(4). \n \n \nApplicant was aware, however, of the unpaid medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.a(1).  He admitted receiving a letter from a collection agency concerning the debt \naround 2003.  He testified he did not tell many of the individuals who supported him with \ncharacter letters about his debts because he found it embarrassing.  The only debt he \ndisclosed on his SF 86 was one that had been resolved in his favor.  He has held a \nclearance for much of his professional life and is familiar with the security clearance \napplication process.  He knew how to handle a situation where he had incomplete \ninformation, because he had done so on his previous SF 86 in May 1999.  \nNotwithstanding his claim that he was rushed while completing his July 2004 \napplication, he included considerable detail, including derogatory information, on that \nApplication.  I found his explanations for not disclosing this medical bill (that he intended \nto pay it, did not know it was reported as delinquent, did not know how many days it was \nlate, did not know how to answer the question) implausible and not credible.   \n \n \nApplicant also was aware of the unpaid bill from the psychologist.  He had been \ninformed it would be reported as delinquent. He knew the correct way to handle a \ndisputed debt on his SF 86, because he had disclosed and explained two disputed \ndebts in his May 1999 application.  I find his explanation for not disclosing the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a(3) implausible and not credible.   \n \nBased on his deliberate omissions of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a(1) and 2.a(3) from \nhis SF 86, I conclude the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the \nburden to Applicant to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(a).  Applicant did not correct the omissions from his SF 86 until \nquestioned by a security investigator.  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d  AG 17(c).  This mitigating \ncondition, like AG 20(a) under Guideline F, consists of three disjunctive prongs and one \nconjunctive prong.  The first prong (\u201cso minor\u201d) is not established because Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification was a felony, as discussed below under Guideline J.  The second prong \n(\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) is not established because the falsification involves \nApplicant\u2019s current application for continuation of his clearance.  The third prong is not \nestablished because the falsification did not happen under \u201cunique circumstances\u201d but \nduring a routine reapplication for a clearance.  Finally, the fourth prong is not \nestablished because Applicant\u2019s lack of candor on his application raises doubt about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  I conclude AG 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nConduct under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence showing \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d  AG 17(d).  Applicant has resolved all his delinquent debts, \nthereby eliminating the circumstances that motivated the falsification, but he has not \nacknowledged his falsification.  I conclude AG 17(d) is not established. \n \n \nFinally, conduct under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress.\u201d AG 17(e).  Applicant has resolved his delinquent debts, thereby reducing his \nvulnerability.  I conclude AG 17(e) is established. \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant committed a felony by intentionally not disclosing the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a(1)-(4) in his SF 86.  The concern raised by criminal \nconduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 30.  Conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple \nlesser offenses.\u201d  AG 31(a). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates.  A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J. The statute encompasses deliberate \nconcealment of information as well as affirmative misstatements.  See United States v. \nBeck, 615 F. 2d 441, 453 (7th Cir. 1980).  Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions on his SF 86 \nraise the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(a), shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 32(a).  This mitigating \ncondition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s falsification was recent, did not happen \nunder unusual circumstances, and casts doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness.  No \nother enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult and a retired Army noncommissioned officer who has \nheld a clearance for many years, apparently without incident. He is talented and highly \nrespected by his colleagues and former supervisors. His long-standing financial \nproblems were disclosed in his 1999 security clearance application.  His problems were \nexacerbated by geographical separation from his family and his wife\u2019s financial \nirresponsibility.  Based on his military service and years of service as a federal \ncontractor, he was aware of the security clearance process and the importance of \ncandor.  Nevertheless, he was embarrassed by his financial situation and did not \ndisclose it to many of his colleagues and professional acquaintances.  Most importantly, \nhe intentionally did not disclose two significant medical debts on his SF 86.  Confronted \nat the hearing with the intentional omissions from his SF 86, he persisted in rationalizing \nand attempting to justify his action.   \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, E, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations, but he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns under Guidelines E and J for his intentional \n\n \n13 \n \n \nfailure to disclose the two medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a(1) and 2.a(3). I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a(1): \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a(2): \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a(3): \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a(4): \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA), on December\nFebruary 28, 2006. On July 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on August 24, 2007. She\nelected to have her case decided administratively without a hearing. A copy of the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on September 17, 2007. Applicant received the FORM\non January 8, 2008. Applicant\u2019s response was due by February 8, 2008. No response\nwas received at DOHA. The case was assigned to this administrative judge on March 4,\nMarch 24, 2008\n\n Next to each debt in the SOR, Applicant indicated in writing that she admitted owing the debt. She also wrote\n1\nadditional information about the debt. For example, under SOR 1.i., Applicant wrote updated information that\nthe debt had been sold to a collection agency. W hether this information was obtained through her research\nin an effort to identify and pay the debt, or through the mail in the ordinary course of business events to notify\nthe debtor of the present status of the debt is unknown. \n2\n2008. Based upon a review of the FORM, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nThere are ten debt allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant admitted all alleged debts,  and attributed the delinquent debts to her former\n1\nhusband who reneged on his promise to pay them off. She advised she was now in a\nposition to address the debts, and desired to consolidate them. \nApplicant is 30 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor as a\nstewart assistant since February 2008. She seeks her first security clearance.\nThe 10 debts (two gas and eight general credit cards) listed in the SOR total $11,\n328.00. The debts in SOR 1.a. through 1.f. became delinquent between 2000 and\nNovember 2002. The more recent debts fell delinquent between 2003 and 2006. In her\nsecurity clearance application (SCA, GX 4), she indicated she was delinquent to the\nSOR 1.c. and the 1.j. creditors, and was making payments. No additional information\nwas provided.  \nThe only source of explanatory information for her financial delinquencies\nbesides the supplemental statement to her answer, is the information Applicant\nprovided May 17, 2007 in her answers to interrogatories. (GX 5) She stated in response\nto question 3 of GX 5:\nAlthough the debt is in my name, it was accrued during my first marriage\nand should be equally shared. I\u2019ve tried unsuccessfully to resolve this\nmatter with my ex[-]husband. During our divorce my husband decided he\nwas not going to help pay our debt any longer. This resulted in late\npayments and eventually no payments because I did not have the means\nto handle it alone. I am saving money currently to pay my debt, in hopes\nthe credit card companies might drop the late fees, etc, if I am able to\nhand them the majority of the cash in one lump sum. Working for\n[employer] has been the light at the end of the \u201cdebtors\u201d tunnel and I hope\nmy employment with them will not be affected by this issue. Thank you.\nNo additional information was provided about Applicant\u2019s negotiations to pay the\ncreditors or consolidate her debt. Furthermore, Applicant has provided no information\nabout her job performance.\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the general policy factors of\nthe whole person concept. The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\nsecurity clearance decision.\nThe protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-\nthe-clock responsibility. The Government places a high degree of trust and confidence\nin individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include\nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of\nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nInability to pay bills on time places the individual debtor at risk of committing\nillegal acts to generate funds. \n\n4\nAnalysis\nThe SOR lists 10 past due debts totaling $11,328.00. Four of the debts have\nbeen delinquent since 2000. Though Applicant contends she made payments to at least\ntwo of the creditors, it is her responsibility to support her contention, and she failed to do\nso. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and\nFC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nThe FC guideline contains four mitigating conditions (MC) that may allay the\nsecurity concerns cause by a person\u2019s indebtedness. FC mitigating condition (MC) 20.a.\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrently reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment) may overcome dated financial\nissues that occurred under peculiar circumstances which are unlikely to recur. Though\nfive of the listed debts are more than five years old, the remaining debts are delinquent\nby five years or less. FC MC 32.a. does not apply.\nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control, and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) has limited application to this case because of Applicant\u2019s marital\ntroubles. Her marital discord does not receive greater weight because it lacks detail.\nWas her husband\u2019s agreement (to pay the delinquent debt) an unofficial understanding\nthat the two parties made after they separated, or was this agreement actually a\ncondition in the divorce? Without more information about the surrounding circumstances\nof his decision to pay the delinquent debts, it is difficult to conclude whether she acted\nreasonably after he stopped paying the past due debt. She claimed she made payments\non the debts, but provided no documents to verify this claim.\nFC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\ndoes not apply as there is no evidence of counseling or evidence to demonstrate the\nfinancial problems are under control.\nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) does not apply either. Applicant\u2019s statements of intention to\nsave money so she could negotiate with her creditors and/or enroll in a debt\nconsolidation plan have little probative weight because she has presented no\ndocumented proof of her intentions. Applicant\u2019s improved financial position has no\nprobative value unless coupled with corroborated action to pay off her overdue debts. \nWhole Person Concept\nAs explained on page 18 of Enclosure 2 of Directive 5220.6, the decision\nwhether to grant or deny a security clearance depends on a common sense\nassessment of the FC guideline evaluated in the context of the whole person. I have\ncarefully evaluated the FC guideline in the context of the general factors of the whole\n\n5\nperson. Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems began in 2000 when she was 22 years\nold, and her first credit card bill became delinquent. In the next eight years, Applicant\naccumulated nine additional delinquent accounts. Her claims of continuing to pay\nseveral of the creditors after her separation and divorce from her spouse suffer from an\nabsence of proof demonstrating continued payments or any other action to resolve her\nindebtedness. Without evidence indicating changes made in the way Applicant\nmanages her past due debt and overall financial practices, it is likely Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are likely to continue. The amount of delinquent debt and the lack of\ndocumentation to resolve the debts substantiates a finding against Applicant under SOR\n1.a. through 1.j. Accordingly, the FC guideline is resolved against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25. of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, that Applicant\u2019s brother is a resident citizen of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that his parents are PRC citizens who were staying with him in the U.S. on visitor visas as of October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), that his mother-in-law and stepfather-in-laws are resident citizens of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that his mother-in-law had worked as a technician for a PRC nuclear agency before her retirement (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and his stepfather is or had been an employee of the same government agency (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and that Applicant traveled to the PRC in at least May 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). In his response of July 26, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR without explanation. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 17, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 26, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response on August 6, 2007. Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on September 26, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on\nOctober 2, 2007. On November 15, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for December 11,\n2007. At the hearing convened as scheduled, two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) and\nJanuary 16, 2008\n\nApplicant testified that on graduation from junior high school, students may attend technology school in lieu\n1\nof high school and then go to work (\u201c. . .in China the technology school gives a degree that\u2019s lower than high\nschool but above junior high. . . .\u201d Tr. 55).\n2\nfour Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were admitted. Applicant and one witness, his direct\nsupervisor, testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on December 21, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn September 26, 2007, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be\ntaken of certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The request was\nbased on publications from the U.S. State Department, the Office of the Secretary of\nDefense, the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, the U.S. China\nEconomic and Security Review Commission, and the Office of the National\nCounterintelligence Executive. The government\u2019s formal request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. On October\n9, 2007, I gave Applicant until October 30, 2007, to file any objections and/or to submit\nalternative facts for administrative notice. Applicant did not respond by the due date but\nindicated at the hearing that he had no objections. I agreed to take administrative notice\nof certain facts, which are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, that Applicant\u2019s brother is a\nresident citizen of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that his parents are PRC citizens who were\nstaying with him in the U.S. on visitor visas as of October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), that his\nmother-in-law and stepfather-in-laws are resident citizens of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that\nhis mother-in-law had worked as a technician for a PRC nuclear agency before her\nretirement (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and his stepfather is or had been an employee of the same\ngovernment agency (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and that Applicant traveled to the PRC in at least May\n2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). In his response of July 26, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in the SOR without explanation. After consideration of the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior electrical engineer employed by a U.S. defense\ncontractor since January 2006. He held an interim secret-level security clearance that\nwas withdrawn on issuance of the SOR.\nApplicant was born in the PRC to resident citizens in December 1971. His father\nwas a math teacher and his mother was an administrator at a public technology school\nin the PRC before they retired in 2001 and 2002, respectively.  They were never\n1\nmembers of the Chinese Communist Party. Applicant\u2019s maternal grandfather had\n\n3\nimmigrated from Indonesia to the PRC in the early 1940s to avoid prosecution and his\nmother was discriminated against during the Cultural Revolution because of her ethnic\nbackground. She was denied the opportunity to study for a medical degree despite top\nacademics in high school. After being trained as a nurse, she went into school\nadministration.\nApplicant was raised in the PRC with his brother, who was born in February\n1973. After he graduated from college, Applicant began working as an electrical\nengineer for a privately owned telephone company. In August 1995, Applicant came to\nthe U.S. to pursue graduate studies in electrical engineering at a public university.\nApplicant planned to work in the U.S. for a few years after he finished his graduate\nstudies and then return to the PRC. While at the university, he met his spouse. A native\nof the PRC, she had been raised by her grandparents. Her mother and stepfather lived\nin another city because of their jobs. In 1991, when he was 15, she came to the U.S.\nwith her father who was studying at a private technological university. Following his\npremature death in 1993 or 1994, she decided to stay in the U.S. permanently.\nAfter he earned his master\u2019s degree, Applicant relocated to his present locale in\nJuly 1997 to work as an electrical engineer in the semiconductor industry. In August\n1999, Applicant and his spouse married. Although he had applied for his green card\nback in 1997, Applicant decided on his marriage to make the U.S. his permanent home.\nHis spouse, who was already a U.S. permanent resident, wanted to remain in the U.S.\nHe was also persuaded by his parents, who feared that his time in the U.S. and the\nnature of his work could lead to their persecution in the PRC if the Chinese Communist\nParty should change their present policies. In December 2000, Applicant\u2019s spouse\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nApplicant traveled to the PRC to see his parents and brother for three weeks,\nfrom May 2002 to June 2002. It was his first trip back to China since coming to the U.S.\nin 1995 and he had not seen his relatives in seven years.\nIn September 2002, Applicant left his job to pursue doctoral studies at a private\ntechnological university in the area. In late July 2005, Applicant became a U.S. citizen,\ntaking an oath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S.\nConstitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian\nservice on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant formally took on the anglicized first\nname that he had been using since 1995. A few days after his U.S. naturalization, he\nand his spouse had a daughter. In August 2005, he obtained his U.S. passport.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law came to the U.S. from the PRC in late June 2005 to\nhelp Applicant\u2019s spouse who was then expecting. She stayed for six months with\nApplicant and her daughter. After her mother returned to the PRC, Applicant\u2019s spouse\ncontacted her about once every two months.\nIn January 2006, Applicant began working for his present employer as a senior\nelectrical engineer while finishing up his Ph.D. degree, which was awarded him in\n\n4\nFebruary 2007. In March 2006, Applicant\u2019s parents came to the U.S. on visitor visas so\nthat he could take care of them. In summer 2006, he sponsored his parents for U.S.\npermanent residency, and they obtained their green cards in July 2007.\nIn about April 2006, Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor asked Applicant to apply for a\nsecret-level clearance so that he could contribute to a particular project. On April 10,\n2006, Applicant executed an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP). Applicant gave his parents\u2019 permanent residence in the PRC as their current\nresidence, although they were staying with him and his spouse at the time. He disclosed\nthat his brother and parents-in-law were resident citizens of the PRC. In October 2006,\nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator in conjunction with his\nbackground investigation for his security clearance. Applicant\u2019s parents were still in the\nU.S. He had twice yearly contact with his mother-in-law, who was living with her spouse\nin an apartment in a PRC major city. \nAs of December 2007, Applicant\u2019s parents were residing in a rented apartment in\nthe U.S., in a  city convenient to public transportation and the local Chinatown. Applicant\nwas paying the rental costs as his parents did not have any stable source of income.\nOnce in awhile, his mother earns some money taking care of the neighbor\u2019s children.\nHis parents rent out a small apartment that they own in the PRC, which is being handled\nby Applicant\u2019s brother, but the income is just enough to cover the maintenance costs.\nHis parents intend to acquire U.S. citizenship when they become eligible and hope to\nsell their apartment in the PRC when it becomes profitable to do so. They do not intend\nat present to move back to the PRC (\u201cthey don\u2019t have any intention at the moment to\nmove back.\u201d Tr. 68). Applicant believes his mother intends to travel to the PRC in 2008\nto visit her mother, who is almost 90. Applicant has contacted his maternal grandmother\nonly three or four times in the past 12 years. \nApplicant\u2019s brother resides in the PRC with his spouse and young daughter (born\nin 2001). Since his college graduation in 1994, Applicant\u2019s brother has been employed\nby the Chinese government in a local tourist department. He presently works as a clerk.\nTo Applicant\u2019s knowledge, his brother is a Christian and not politically active in the PRC.\nBefore March 2006, Applicant had monthly contact with his brother to check on their\nparents. In the past 18 months, Applicant has contacted his brother only once, on his\nbrother\u2019s birthday. He does not anticipate contacting his brother any more frequently\nthan once or twice a year now that their parents are living near him in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s parents call his brother about once a month.\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law had worked for a nuclear agency within the PRC\ngovernment until their retirements in early 2000. During their last ten years on the job,\nthey organized family benefit activities for the workers. Applicant does not know the\nnature of their previous duties. Due to their small pensions, they mainly live off their\nsavings. Neither Applicant nor his spouse provides financial support for her mother and\nstepfather. In September 2007, Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law came to the U.S. to visit their\ndaughters and grandchildren. Applicant\u2019s spouse has a sister who lives in the U.S. with\nher family. Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law have been staying primarily with Applicant\u2019s family\n\n5\nand intend to return to the PRC in March 2008 before his mother-in-law\u2019s visitor\u2019s visa\nexpires. Applicant\u2019s parents and parents-in-law know that he is applying for a U.S.\nsecurity clearance for his job.\n \nApplicant and his spouse are active in their Christian church in the U.S. Applicant\nvolunteers as a parent helper with the children during church services. All his and his\nspouse\u2019s financial assets are in the U.S. They own a condominium and two cars and\nhave 401(k), checking and savings accounts, and stock assets in the U.S. Both Chinese\nand English are spoken in their home. Applicant\u2019s spouse is employed part-time as a\nbusiness administrator for a local company that sells flow meters.  She has a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in psychology from a private college in the U.S. Applicant has no plan to visit the\nPRC.\nApplicant designs monolithic microwave integrated circuits for his employer. His\nwork performance has exceeded his employer\u2019s expectations. Applicant\u2019s direct\nsupervisor has observed Applicant to be very conscientious in his handling of sensitive\nand proprietary information. Applicant recently completed secure facility training offered\nby his employer.\n*     *     *\nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\neconomic, political, and intelligence activities of the PRC, I take administrative notice of\nthe following facts:\nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of more\nthan a billion people and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an\nauthoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The National\nPeople\u2019s Congress, the PRC\u2019s legislative body, is the highest organ of state power. With\nChina firmly committed to economic reform and greater openness, the influence of\npeople and organizations outside the formal party structure has increased, but in all\nimportant government, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the Chinese\nCommunist Party ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. During 2006,\nthe PRC government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, with a trend toward\nincreased harassment, detention, and imprisonment by government and security\nauthorities of those perceived as threatening to government authority. Foreign visitors in\nthe PRC may be placed under surveillance by security personnel, their hotel rooms,\ntelephones, and facsimile machines monitored, and their personal possessions,\nincluding computers, searched without their knowledge or consent.\nWhile Taiwan has complicated the relationship and been a source of discord\nbetween the U.S. and PRC at times, the U.S. formally recognizes the government of the\nPRC as the sole legal government of China. Since the Tiananmen crackdown in June\n1989, the PRC has sought a higher international profile through its seat as a permanent\nmember of the United Nations, and through diplomatic relations with other countries.\nThe U.S. and PRC have a history of cooperation on scientific, environmental and more\n\n6\nrecently counterterrorism and aspects of law enforcement (computer crime, intellectual\nproperty rights, human smuggling, corruption). China is an important trading partner of\nthe U.S. Its trade surplus with the U.S. was $232.6 billion in 2006, and the U.S. is the\nsecond largest foreign investor in China.\nThe PRC possesses large military forces (strategic nuclear forces, army, navy\nand air force), which are in the process of transformation into a smaller, more mobile,\nhigh tech military. The PRC acquired some advanced weapon systems from Russia. In\nan effort to acquire advanced technology, the PRC has aggressively targeted sensitive\nand protected U.S. economic and militarily critical information. The PRC blends\nintelligence and non-intelligence assets, relying on covert espionage activity by\npersonnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and military industries\nindependent of the PRC intelligence services, and by targeting ethnic Chinese who\nhave access to sensitive information.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has several close family members (parents, brother, and parents-in-law) who\nare citizens of the PRC, a country known to engage in sensitive data collection in the\nU.S. Although his parents enjoy the protections of U.S. permanent residency, they are\nbound to comply with the obligations of their PRC citizenship. Applicant\u2019s brother and in-\nlaws make their permanent homes in the PRC. The security concerns underlying AG \u00b6\n7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion) are implicated. Moreover, the risk of undue foreign influence through his\nspouse and her relationship to her parents requires consideration of disqualifying\ncondition AG \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion).\n\n8\nThe Government also urges security concerns over Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s present\nand his in-laws\u2019 former government employments in the PRC. Nothing about his\nbrother\u2019s duties as a clerk in a local government tourism office suggests military,\nsecurity, or intelligence activities. Although his parents-in-law worked for the PRC\u2019s\nnuclear agency, Applicant credibly testified that their duties were nontechnical, at least\nduring the ten years preceding their retirements in 2000. However, it is highly probable\nthat his brother is in contact with other government officials because of his work, and his\nbrother depends on the PRC government for his livelihood. His parents-in-law sustain\nthemselves at least in part on their government pensions. It is difficult to discount the\nrisks of Applicant\u2019s brother or in-laws being exploited by the PRC to enlist Applicant\u2019s\ncooperation in furnishing sensitive data. Applicant has not broken his contacts with his\nbrother, even if he calls him only once or twice a year. Moreover, Applicant is bound by\naffection and financial obligation to his parents, who have a close enough relationship to\ntheir younger son to telephone him regularly and to rely on him to handle their\napartment in the PRC. Applicant\u2019s in-laws are staying with him and his spouse for six\nmonths, from September 2007 to March 2008. Although his spouse was raised by her\ngrandparents,  she has a bond with her mother, who is on her second extended stay in\nApplicant\u2019s home.\nApplicant\u2019s travel to the PRC in May 2002 was primarily to see his parents. His\ntravel is relevant as it confirms his affection for his parents, but there is no evidence that\nApplicant engaged in any conduct while in the PRC that would warrant application of AG\n\u00b6 (7)(i) (conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the\nindividual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country). Applicant\u2019s trip to the PRC in 2002 does not raise current\nsecurity concerns where his parents now reside in the U.S. and he has no plan to visit\nthe PRC. \nApplicant bears a heavy burden of mitigation, given the history and current\npolitical and security conditions extant in the PRC and Applicant\u2019s relationships with\nfamily members who have citizenship and/or residency ties to the PRC. The PRC has\nan aggressive record of pursuing sensitive U.S. information, even targeting U.S. citizens\nof Chinese ancestry to obtain cutting-edge technology. While the PRC continues to\nmaintain strong diplomatic interest with the U.S. and has been helpful in strategic efforts\nto suppress nuclear threats in the region and terrorism internationally, it continues to\nviolate basic human rights of its citizens and to suppress activities perceived to threaten\nCommunist Party control. The risk of undue foreign influence is substantially lessened\nwith respect to his parents because of their legal permanent residency in the U.S. and\ntheir intention to remain in the U.S. and sell their apartment in the PRC. However, I am\nunable to apply AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). Applicant\u2019s mother was\ndiscriminated against because of her ethnicity in the past, and she intends to travel to\n\n9\nthe PRC to see her mother sometime in 2008. His brother and parents-in-law (albeit to a\nlesser extent) depend on the PRC government for their incomes.\nSecurity concerns could be overcome by deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government,\nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest)). Although Applicant came to the U.S. in 1995, his\nintention at that time was to earn his graduate education, work for a few years, and then\nreturn to his native PRC. However, shortly thereafter, he met his spouse. Unlike\nApplicant, she had been educated in the U.S. from high school, and intended to remain\nhere.  In 1997, he applied for legal permanent residency, and after his marriage in 1999,\ndecided to make his home in the U.S. Knowing the PRC does not recognize dual\ncitizenship, he became a U.S. citizen in 2005 and within a month had his U.S. passport.\nWhile his parents were visiting him from the PRC, he sponsored their U.S. immigration,\nand they became lawful permanent residents in July 2007. Applicant has also\ndeveloped ties within his community, particularly within his church where he volunteers\nto help with the children. All of his financial assets, including a home, are in the U.S. His\nwork performance has exceeded his employer\u2019s expectations, and he has\nconscientiously handled sensitive information.\nYet, his demonstrated commitments to the U.S. and trustworthiness at work are\nrelatively recent and must be evaluated in the context of the geopolitical realities that\ngovern PRC-U.S. relations and the potential for exploitation of family members who are\nresident citizens of the PRC. Applicant testified that his parents and parents-in-law are\naware that he is applying for a security clearance. Applicant has not told his brother, but\nhis parents have ongoing contact with their younger son, and it is not clear what he\nknows about Applicant\u2019s work. Based on the record before me, I am unable to conclude\nwith a reasonable degree of certainty that Applicant is unlikely to be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n10\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nNothing in the record suggests that Applicant is other than a loyal U.S. citizen.\nHowever, the salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of\nloyalty or allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. Too much uncertainty exists to permit safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to recognize and withstand the risks of undue\ninfluence attributable to his familial relationships in the PRC. When asked at his hearing\nwhether he considered his in-laws vulnerability at all heightened by the knowledge that\nhe is applying for a security clearance, Applicant responded that his in-laws no longer\nhave any connection to the PRC government. (Tr. 72) In its efforts to acquire sensitive\ntechnology and information, the PRC employs a variety of techniques (overt and covert)\nand personnel, including foreign visitors and commercial sector employees. While his in-\nlaws\u2019 retirement may reduce the likelihood of foreign influence, it does not completely\neliminate the risk.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaires for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on\nNovember 3, 2004. On March 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns\nunder Guideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 14, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on April 30, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. DOHA received the request on May 5, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on May 30, 2008. Another judge was assigned the case on June 2, 2008,\nbut could not proceed with it because of a medical emergency, and requested a\nOctober 9, 2008\n\n2\npostponement. I received the case assignment on July 21, 2008. DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on July 24, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 27,\n2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through C,\nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on September 4, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China (PRC). (Tr. 33) The request\nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the\nrecord for the purpose offered. The facts administratively noticed are set out below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1. relating the security\nconcerns arising from the possibilities of divided loyalties, and admitted the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a, and 1.b, concerning three relatives who are citizens of the PRC and his\ntwo trips there in the 1990's with explanations. He also provided additional information\nto support his request for eligibility for a public trust position.  \nApplicant is a 47-year-old computer scientist who received a master\u2019s degree in\n2001 from a leading U.S. university He received an undergraduate degree in electrical\nengineering in China before coming to the U.S. in 1987. In China he briefly taught\ncomputer control technology at the university level (Tr. 19). He became a citizen of the\nU.S. in 2000. After receiving his advanced degree in 2001, he worked in industry for\neight years as a web developer for three companies. He has worked for his present\nemployer as an applications developer (Tr. 22) for four years developing tools for\ninspection and scoring relating to civilian records (Tr. 46). In this work he does not use\nactual records of civilian employees but uses \u201cdummy data\u201d (Tr. 36). His employer is a\nsub-contractor to a major defense contractor. He has no access to classified\ninformation.\nWhen Applicant first came to the U.S. he worked as a manager in a Chinese\nrestaurant for seven years saving his money for education and a family. In 1998 he\nmarried a U.S. citizen of Chinese origin whom he met at the restaurant where she also\nworked. They were married in 1997. They have two children who are four and eight. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a 75-year-old retired doctor. She worked in a government\nclinic and lives in China. She visited him once for a month in the U.S. in 2001. His\nbrother is a citizen of and lives in China where he runs a small private store selling\nwood flooring that is owned by an American (Tr. 25). Before taking his present job he\nwas a public high school teacher. \n\n3\nApplicant has one sister who is a citizen of and lives in China in a home for\nmentally disabled. His second sister has lived in the U.S. since 1976 and is a U.S.\ncitizen. Her husband was born in China but is a U.S. citizen. She and Applicant lived\nwith their father\u2019s family in China in their youth after their parents were divorced. She\ncame to the U.S. two years before Applicant. His brother and sister in China lived with\ntheir mother\u2019s family in China after the divorce (Tr. 31). The father\u2019s side of the family\nhas had fewer contacts with his mother\u2019s side of the family since the divorce. He now\nhas four or five contacts via phone or e-mail with his brother every year, and calls his\nmother a few times a year on special holidays or anniversaries (Tr. 29). He has no\ncontact with his sister in China because of her incapacity. \nIn 1992 Applicant traveled to China because of the illness of his father who died\nsoon after the visit. In 1997 he traveled again to China to introduce his family to his\nwife. He has no plans for further travel to China. He regards himself as a loyal citizen of\nthe U.S. who has settled here and regards it as his country (Tr. 10-11).\nApplicant is well regarded by his employer for his skills and dedication to\naccomplishing the work he does for the company (Exhs. B and C). He is highly\nregarded for his truthfulness, honesty, and loyalty by two colleagues who testified for\nhim (Tr. 40-58). His supervisor for the past three years also testified for him as to his\ncharacter, honesty, and trustworthiness. He rated him 4.7 on a scale of 1-5 for his work\nperformance (Tr. 57). \nApplicant has all his financial assets in the U.S. and none in China. He owns a\nhome worth over $250,000, a 401k account worth well over $20,000, a life insurance\npolicy, and mutual funds. His wife and father-in-law own a small restaurant that his wife\noperates (Tr. 73-74). \nI take administrative notice of the following facts relating to the PRC from the\ndocuments offered at the hearing. China has an authoritarian government, dominated\nby the Chinese Communist Party. China and the U.S. have been rivals with particular\ndisagreements over Taiwan, and the civil liberties of Chinese citizens. They also\ncollaborate on such matters as nuclear issues in North Korea. The U.S. is a primary\nintelligence target for China. U.S. citizens of Chinese birth are often intelligence targets\nby the PRC. China has a poor record for human rights as exemplified by the\nTiananmen Square incidents in 1989, and other suppressions of dissent by the\ngovernment. Some acts of terrorism have occurred on Chinese soil. \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for .\n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\n\n4\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.).\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set\nout in AG & 6:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism\nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion (AG \u00b6 7a).\nBased on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of family\nmembers living abroad and travel there twice in the 1990's, the Government\nestablished a basis for a security concern over foreign influence. The Applicant had the\nburden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or\nextenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb.\n8, 2001). \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8. Mitigating\nconditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are located, or the\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual group or government and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8a).\nApplicant is a person of substance and veracity who is well educated and holds a\nresponsible position in the defense industry. He provided sincere and credible\ntestimony concerning his loyalty to the U.S., and his relationships with his family. \nWhile the PRC is a country of concern to the U.S., the fact that Applicant has\nlived in the U.S. for 20 years, been a citizen for eight years, and has all his investments\nand immediate family in the U.S. outweigh the concerns raised by his few relatives who\nreside in the PRC. There is no heightened risk for him in receiving a trustworthy\n\n6\ndetermination. His reputation for loyalty among his associates and supervisor as\nindicated at the hearing is further evidence to support mitigation of the security\nconcerns raised. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns do not arise\nbecause of any misconduct by Applicant, but solely because three family members live\nin China where he was born, and that he took two trips to visit them over ten years ago.\nThe above cited factors are not precisely relevant to this type of case. Of relevance is\nhis expressed feelings concerning his identity as an American citizen and where his\nloyalty and obligations belong. He is well-motived and well-educated with firm ties to the\nU.S. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from foreign\ninfluence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: For Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a - 1.r that Applicant owes approximately $28,678.83 in delinquent debts accrued since January 2000. Applicant admitted all of the SOR \u00b6 1 allegations. Seven of the listed debts are unpaid medical bills (SOR 1.k - 1.q) totaling $378 (an average of $54 each).

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nOn April 2, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application(SF 86) to\nrequest a security clearance as part of his employment with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant\n1\na security clearance. On August 22, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E, (personal conduct), Guideline F\n2\n(financial considerations), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 19, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on\nDecember 13, 2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. Without objection, I admitted\nfive exhibits offered by the government (Gx. 1 - 5). Applicant testified in his own behalf,\nand offered three exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n(Ax.) A - C. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 2, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a - 1.r that Applicant\nowes approximately $28,678.83 in delinquent debts accrued since January 2000.\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR \u00b6 1 allegations. Seven of the listed debts are unpaid\nmedical bills (SOR 1.k - 1.q) totaling $378 (an average of $54 each). Another is an\nunpaid municipal tax bill for $234 in collection since 2003 (SOR 1.f), and one is a debt\nreferred for collection from a defaulted auto loan for $19,219.83 (SOR 1.q). The\nremaining debts are for unpaid credit cards or other consumer credit accounts.\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR 2 that Applicant deliberately\nfalsified his SF 86 by failing to list one of his delinquent debts that was being enforced\nthrough an as yet unpaid civil judgment (SOR 2.a); and that he also deliberately failed to\nlist in the same SF 86 that he was, at the time he completed the form, more than 90\ndays past due on the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.f, which were accrued before he\ncompleted the SF 86. (SOR 2.b) Applicant also admitted these allegations.\nUnder Guideline J, the government cross-alleged his false answers from SOR 2\nas potential violations of federal law under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 (SOR 3.a); that he was\narrested in September 2000 and charged with 3  degree assault and violation of\nrd\nprobation from an earlier offense (SOR 3.b); and that he was arrested in January 2002\nand charged with risk of injury, breach of the peace, and 3  degree criminal mischief\nrd\n(SOR 3.c). Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR 3.b and 3.c, but did not provide an\nanswer to SOR 3.a. After a brief discussion at hearing, I entered a denial of this\nallegation on his behalf. (Tr., 15 - 19) After a thorough review of the pleadings,\ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 32 years old and employed as a pipefitter by a defense contractor\nthat supports a Navy shipyard. He is a single father of two children, a high school\ngraduate, and is attending company-sponsored courses in industrial management at a\nnearby community college. Applicant has worked for his current employer since\nDecember 2003. Around the time he was hired, he also started working part-time at a\nretail warehouse to bring in extra money.\nApplicant was born and raised in New England, but moved to his current state\naround August 2003. (Tr., 73) From 1994 until 2002, he worked in a hospital in his\nhome state, but was either unemployed or worked sporadically from about June 2002\nuntil he moved to his current locale. \n\n3\nFrom 1994 until 2001, Applicant lived with a girlfriend with whom he fathered two\nchildren, now ages 12 and 7. In May 2002, he was given primary custody of the children\nand initially received $400 in child support from their mother each month. In February\n2007, he successfully petitioned for more child support based on the cost of living in his\ncurrent locale. (Ax. A and B) He now receives $672 each month in child support. (Tr.,\n52)\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend ended acrimoniously. In September\n2000, he was arrested and charged with assault after an argument with his girlfriend\nturned physical. He was given a suspended sentence of one year in jail and placed on\nprobation for two years. (Tr., 61 - 62) \nIn January 2002, while still on probation, he was arrested and charged with\nreckless endangerment, breach of the peace, and 3  degree criminal mischief. After an\nrd\nargument with his then estranged girlfriend, Applicant threw a rock at her car, shattering\na window as she drove away with one of their children in the car. He was found guilty of\nthe breach of peace charge, thereby violating his probation. Applicant served four\nmonths of a six-month jail sentence, and completed two months of probation. (Tr., 66 -\n69)\nDuring their relationship, Applicant and his girlfriend together made about $5,500\neach month. Applicant opened several credit accounts and was able to stay current with\nthem until his girlfriend left in 2001. (Tr., 44 - 45) Thereafter, both before and after he\nmoved, he accrued the delinquencies listed in the SOR. Despite the fact he lives as\nfrugally as possible, he acknowledged he does not have the means to pay his debts\n(Tr., 80 - 81). He has not taken any action to pay or otherwise resolve them. (Gx. 2; Tr.,\n44) Despite an increase in income and child support since February 2007 (Ax. C),\nApplicant still has a negative monthly cash flow of several hundred dollars. (Tr., 51 - 53)\nHe has not sought help from credit counseling services or other financial resources.\nWhen Applicant submitted his SF 86, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 37, which\nasked if he had any unpaid judgments against him in the preceding seven years. At the\ntime, there was an unpaid judgment against him in favor of the Capitol One credit card\ncompany for a $927 delinquency. The judgment had been entered in November 2003,\nabout three months after he moved to his current state. Applicant\u2019s explanation that he\ndid not know about the judgment when he submitted the SF 86 (Tr., 60) is plausible.\nIn response to question 38, which asked if, in the preceding seven years, he had\never been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt, he answered \u201cyes\u201d and listed\none unpaid credit card debt for $976. Applicant then answered \u201cno\u201d to question 39,\nwhich asked if he was, at the time he submitted the SF 86, more than 90 days past due\non any debt. Applicant asserted that he was told simply to list whatever debts he was\naware of. (Tr., 60)\nThe unpaid medical bills listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k - 1.q were incurred for emergency\nroom treatments for one of his children, who has allergies that arise on the spring and\nfall. The amounts owed represent the remainder above his medical insurance coverage.\n(Tr., 79) The $19,219 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.r was a loan for a motorcycle he and his\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n4\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n4\nex-girlfriend purchased. She has the bike and he still owes about $5,000 for his portion\nof the loan. (Tr., 82)\nApplicant moved away from his home state to make a fresh start. He is trying to\nbe a good father for his children and to improve is station in life. The community college\ncourses his employer is paying for will, hopefully, help him advance in his profession so\nthat he may be better able to resolve his financial problems and provide for his children.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n4\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties at hearing require consideration of the security concerns and\nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18,\nGuideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15, and Guideline J (criminal conduct) at AG \u00b6\n30.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nUnder Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18) The government\u2019s exhibits, along with Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions and testimony, are sufficient to support the SOR allegations. Since about\n2002, Applicant has accrued significant unpaid debts consisting of credit cards, a\nmunicipal tax bill, an auto loan, telephone and television accounts, and several unpaid\nmedical bills. Before he moved in 2003, his debts were the result of his overuse of\npersonal credit, which he was unable to pay back after he no longer had his girlfriend\u2019s\nincome to use. His debts, which total between $14,000 and $28,000 (depending on how\nmuch he actually owes on the motorcycle), have not been paid or otherwise resolved.\nApplicant lacks the means to resolve them as he has a significant negative monthly\ncash flow and has not enlisted any outside help to overcome his financial problems. \nThese facts require consideration of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be\nindicated \nby \nexcessive \nindebtedness, \nsignificant \nnegative \ncash \nflow, \nhigh\ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis). Because there is no record of\nrepayment or other action to resolve his debts, and because his financial problems are\nprolonged by his current lack of sufficient income to meet his monthly expenses, much\nless pay off his past debts, none of the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20 may be\nconsidered based on this record. Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns about his financial problems.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in AG \u00b6\n15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d The\ngovernment presented sufficient information to show that Applicant\u2019s answers to SF 86\nquestions 37 (unpaid judgments) and 39 (debts more than 90 days past due) were\nincorrect. As to question 37, Applicant had moved out the state where he incurred the\ndebt underlying that judgment three months before it was entered. I accept his\n\n6\nexplanation that he was unaware of the judgment when he answered question 37, and I\nresolve SOR \u00b6 3.b in his favor. \nAs to question 39, Applicant knew in April 2004 that he had debts but asserted\ndid not know their full extent. SOR \u00b6 3.c cites the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.f as\nthose debts he knew or should have known were more than 90 days past due when he\ncompleted the SF 86 in April 2004. However, as discussed above, the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.e was the judgment at issue in SOR \u00b6 3.b. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f also appears to have\ngone to collection after Applicant moved in August 2003. However, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a - 1.d were delinquent for between one and three years before Applicant moved.\nWhile SOR \u00b6 1.a is only a $66 debt, the other three are each significant debts, together\ntotaling nearly $6,000. It is untenable for Applicant to claim he did not know about these\ndelinquencies. The fact he disclosed a single debt (not listed in the SOR) in response to\nquestion 38 (debts more than 180 days delinquent) might, under some circumstances,\nbe insufficient to put the government on notice of his financial problems. However, given\nthe extent of his financial problems even before he moved in August 2003, he should\nhave at least answered \u201cyes\u201d and provided some information about the other debts. The\ntotality of the available information bearing on the issue of Applicant\u2019s intent at the time\nhe answered SF 86 question 39 shows he deliberately withheld relevant information\nabout his debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c.\nThese facts require consideration of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6\n16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance  eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities). Further, of the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 17, the record\nsupports consideration of AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added). Applicant submitted his\nSF 86 more than three years ago, and this is the only known instance of dishonesty in\nhis background. Since then, he has worked without incident for his employer while doing\nhis best to start over. On balance, the security concerns arising from his deliberate false\nstatements about his debts are mitigated.\nCriminal Conduct.\nUnder Guideline J, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) The government\u2019s\nexhibits, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony, are sufficient to support the\nSOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c. Applicant was arrested for and convicted of\nassaulting his ex-girlfriend during an argument in September 2000. In 2003, while he\nwas still on probation from that conviction, he was convicted of breach of the peace\nafter he threw a rock through her car window after an argument. For that offense, he\nserved four months of a six month jail sentence. Because of the passage of time since\nthose offenses, Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct would not likely be an issue in this case.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 3, supra.\n9\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n7\nHowever, the government also showed that Applicant deliberately made a false\nstatement to the government when he withheld information about his debts by\nanswering \u201cno\u201d to SF 86 question 39. When Applicant signed his SF 86, he certified his\nanswers were true, and he so certified having been advised that to \u201cknowingly and\nwillfully make a false statement on [the SF 86] can be punished by fine or imprisonment\nor both.\u201d (Gx. 1) \nThese facts require consideration of the disqualifying condition listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6\n31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and 31(c) (allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted). Of the mitigating conditions listed in AG 32, I have\nconsidered AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\nwould be available to Applicant. As to his two arrests, Applicant\u2019s circumstances have\ncompletely changed. Aside from negotiating child visitation and support issues with his\nex-girlfriend, he has no contact with here. As to the criminal conduct associated with his\nfalsification of his SF 86, for the same reasons discussed under Guideline E, above, I\nconclude he is unlikely to engage in criminal conduct in the future, and the security\nconcerns under this guideline are mitigated\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines E, F, and J. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is a mature adult, and a responsible single father of two. He is trying to\n8\nimprove his personal and professional circumstances and is progressing toward his\ngoals. For those reasons, the personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns are no\nlonger a security concern. Nonetheless, his financial problems are significant and were\nbrought about by his own poor judgement. Applicant continues to struggle with debt and\nhis routine expenses, and he has not incurred new delinquencies. However, despite his\nbest intentions to resolve these matters in the near future, the facts about Applicant\u2019s\nfinances present an unacceptable risk to the national interest were he to be granted\naccess to classified information at this time. Without tangible signs of payment or other\nresolution of his debts, a fair and commonsense assessment  of all of the information\n9\nbearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows there are still doubts about his ability to protect\nthe government\u2019s interests as his own. The protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, and such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\nnational interest.10\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a - 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n                             \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant resigned from federal civilian employment in February 2005 following a\nhistory of inappropriate access of pornographic images using his government computer.\nHe shows little remorse and has not been completely candid about his misconduct.\nClearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SF 86) on January 23,\n2003. On December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline M that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a security\nclearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\nAugust 24, 2009\n\n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR that was received by\nDOHA on February 18, 2009. He requested a hearing, and on April 2, 2009, the case\nwas assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On May 8, 2009, I\nscheduled a hearing for May 29, 2009.\nI convened the hearing on May 29, 2009. Before the introduction of any\nevidence, the SOR was amended at the request of the government with no objection,\nsee infra. The government submitted four exhibits (Ex. 1-4), Exhibits 1-3 were admitted\nwithout any objections. Applicant questioned the relevance of some information in\nExhibit 4. Those statements within Exhibit 4 were stricken with the agreement of\nDepartment Counsel and the document was admitted. Applicant also testified, as\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 8, 2009. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nAt the hearing, the government moved to amend the SOR to add a new\nparagraph 2 alleging a security concern under Guideline E:\nYou falsified material facts during a February 1, 2007, interview with an\ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management when you\ndenied having ever viewed pornography on the Internet.\nOn March 30, 2009, Applicant was furnished a copy of the motion in writing with those\ndocuments the government intended to offer into evidence at his upcoming hearing.\nApplicant did not object to the amendment. The motion was granted, and Applicant\ndenied the allegation.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline M, use of information\ntechnology systems, that Applicant\u2019s employer seized his government computer in or\nabout January 2005 to conduct a forensic investigation for unauthorized or inappropriate\nmaterial (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that the investigation revealed that he had accessed pornographic\nwebsites on the Internet (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he had used his government computer to\naccess pornographic websites after he had completed mandatory computer training in\nNovember 2004 and been warned that such use was unauthorized (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and\nthat he had been verbally counseled in about 2002 for unauthorized use of his\ngovernment computer (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have\nfalsely denied during his February 1, 2007, subject interview that he had ever viewed\npornography on the Internet (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant admitted the Guideline M\nallegations with explanations. Applicant was given an opportunity to respond to the\n\nApplicant admitted that by deleting a file in that manner, it might still be on the computer\u2019s hard drive\n1\nbut that it would eventually be overwritten (Tr. 66).\n3\nGuideline E allegation before the introduction of any evidence. He denied any\nintentional falsification. After consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 37-year-old integration and test engineer who has worked for his\ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since mid-2005 (Tr. 40). He seeks to retain a\ntop secret security clearance that was transferred to his work for his current employer\n(Tr. 94, 115).\nApplicant earned his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in May\n1994 (Exs. 1, 2). In August 1994, he began working as a civilian project engineer for the\nfederal government (Ex. 1, Tr. 37-39). He was granted a secret-level security clearance\nfor his duties in November 1994 (Ex. 2), and it was eventually upgraded to top secret\n(Tr. 115). On December 18, 1997, he applied for access to sensitive compartmented\ninformation (SCI) for his work with sensitive military programs (Ex. 2), and that access\nwas granted in March 1998 (Ex. 1, Tr. 40-41).\nIn 2002, Applicant was verbally counseled by his supervisor for viewing\ninappropriate material on his work computer. Applicant cannot now recall whether the\ncomputer was provided by the government or by a contractor for the government.  The\nconnection was provided by the government (Tr. 44). When asked at his hearing\nwhether he was viewing pornography on the Internet, Applicant responded, \u201cIt\u2019s entirely\npossible.\u201d (Tr. 44). Concerning whether he searched for images or opened electronic\nmail messages, Applicant indicated that \u201ceveryone had come in contact with adult\noriented material at some time.\u201d (Tr. 47). Applicant testified that there were no specific\npolicies about Internet use at that time (\u201cthings were pretty loose\u201d), although they were\nnot allowed to hack into a machine or download illegal material (Tr. 45). Applicant\ndenies he downloaded inappropriate material onto his work computer at that time, or\nthat he accessed child pornography (Tr. 49). No evidence was presented to the\ncontrary.\nIn or before 2004, Applicant switched from a desktop to a laptop computer at\nwork because of frequent travel. He kept the laptop at the office connected to a docking\nstation when he was not on travel (Tr. 54). While on temporary duty overseas for his\nemployer in the summer of 2004, Applicant downloaded a large batch of computer files\nfrom an external hard drive onto his government-provided laptop computer. The files,\nwhich had generic names or titles (Tr. 62), contained not only Hollywood movies but\nalso home videos containing adult content. Applicant obtained the hard drive from a\nsailor at work and he was unaware of specific contents when he loaded it onto his work\ncomputer (Tr. 60-62). As Applicant went through the files, he noticed that some of them\nwere adult oriented in nature (Tr. 58, 61), and he deleted them by dragging them into\nthe trash folder and emptying the folder (Ex. 3, Tr. 58).  Applicant testified that he\n1\ninformed information technology employees on his return from temporary duty that he\n\nThe report of the forensics investigation was not submitted into evidence. In an issue summary of\n2\nAugust 23, 2005, a military adjudicator referred to the security access eligibility report (SAER) from Applicant\u2019s\nthen employer which indicated that Applicant had been surfing the Internet accessing pornographic web sites\nand that he had been verbally counseled for the same problem about three years earlier (Ex. 4). The SAER\nwas also not available for my review, but there is no apparent reason to doubt the accuracy of the\nadjudicator\u2019s summary of the SAER.\nApplicant initially claimed that he knew nothing at that time other than that the investigation was\n3\nongoing (Tr. 65), but he later acknowledged that his supervisor had told him that inappropriate adult material\nhad been found on his laptop\u2019s hard drive (Ex. 3, Tr. 66). He later stated that the unauthorized access\nconcerned one specific day when he was on annual leave (Tr. 90). \n4\nhad deleted the material and that he had exercised \u201cdue diligence in the circumstance\u201d\n(Tr. 58).\nIn November 2004, Applicant completed annual mandatory computer security\ntraining that warned against unauthorized use of government computer systems (Ex. 4).\nIn about late December 2004, Applicant\u2019s work laptop computer was seized by security\npersonnel for a forensic investigation of possible inappropriate access. Applicant was\ngiven a new computer and allowed to continue working. Over the next few weeks,\nApplicant had been informed by his supervisor that inappropriate material had been\nfound on his work computer (Ex. 3). The investigation of the seized laptop revealed that\nApplicant had been accessing pornographic websites via the Internet on his work laptop\ncomputer (Ex. 4).  At his May 29, 2009, hearing, Applicant would neither confirm nor\n2\ndeny whether he had accessed Internet websites containing pornography in late 2004:\nI may have, I may not have. One of the habits I had was in when I left my\ncomputer at work, was often my web browser was often not password\nprotected, so I left my computer unattended. So I may have looked at\nsomething I shouldn\u2019t have or someone may have gotten into my\ncomputer at my expense (Tr. 53-54).\nApplicant worked in a non secured area, although the building in which his cubicle was\nlocated had \u201cswipe access\u201d (Tr. 55).  Applicant testified unrebutted by the government\nthat his computer stayed logged on even when he was away from his desk (Tr. 56), but\nno evidence was presented to confirm that someone else accessed pornography using\nthe laptop assigned to him.\nIn January 2005, the military command issued a security access eligibility report\n(SAER) to the service\u2019s adjudication component recommending that Applicant be found\nineligible for continued SCI access because of his inappropriate access of pornographic\nweb sites using his government computer. On February 2, 2005, Applicant resigned\nfrom his government position and his former employer forwarded the SAER to the\nservice\u2019s adjudication component (Ex. 4). Applicant was aware at the time that\ninappropriate adult material had been found on his laptop (Ex. 3, Tr. 65),  but there is no\n3\nevidence that he knew the SAER had been submitted.\n\n5\nApplicant worked for a company for only a couple of months before going to work\nfor his present employer in mid-2005. On February 1, 2007, Applicant was interviewed\nby a government investigator about his possible misuse of a government computer\nsystem. Applicant explained that he had downloaded files onto his work computer while\non temporary duty overseas in the summer of 2004 that he thought contained \u201cregular\nfirst-run movies\u201d but he discovered included home videos with adult content. Applicant\nacknowledged that his laptop had been seized by security officials when he was at work\n\u201cin late December 2005\" [sic] and that over the next several weeks, he learned from his\nsupervisor that security had found inappropriate adult material on the hard drive. He\nindicated that he resigned his federal employment voluntarily and not under any threat\nof discipline or termination. Applicant averred that he had told his supervisors at his\nsubsequent employment (which he held for only a couple months, Tr. 38) about the\nincident. He denied ever introducing any unauthorized hardware, software or media into\nany information system, or that he had ever viewed pornography online (Ex. 3).\nApplicant denies accessing pornography on the Internet at work since\n\u201csometime before 2005\" (Tr. 69, 81). Applicant claims to have no recall of any direct\ninstance of using a government computer to access a pornographic website after 2002\n(\u201cI mean I was, you know, after I had been counseled by that, I was pretty much scared\nstraight.\u201d Tr. 81-82). He accessed pornographic websites at home within a week or two\nof his hearing in May 2009 (Tr. 69).\nApplicant earned his master\u2019s degree in systems engineering in May 2009 (Tr.\n36) while continuing to work for his present employer.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n6\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nThe security concern about the use of information technology systems is set out\nin \u00b6 39:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nApplicant improperly accessed pornography at work in 2002, for which he was\ncounseled by his supervisor. Although not alleged as a security concern, Applicant\ndownloaded a large batch of files, some containing adult images, onto his government\nlaptop computer in the summer of 2004. His assertion that he was unaware of the adult\ncontent is difficult to accept, given his past history of viewing inappropriate adult\nmaterial at work. Then in about early January 2005, he was found to have improperly\n\n7\naccessed pornography via the Internet on his work laptop computer. He testified that his\nemployer might have found \u201csome remnants of stuff that [he] had deleted a long time\nago\u201d (Tr. 66); that he might have had some \u201crisque material\u201d on there, which \u201cif [he]\nwere to really speculate, there may have been a picture or two of a girl in a bikini on a\ncar\u201d (Tr. 68).  But neither circumstance gets to the root of his misconduct, which was\ninappropriate website access, possibly discovered initially through monitoring, whether\nroutine or targeted, of Internet connectivity. Even assuming that Applicant left his\ncomputer logged on when unattended (Tr. 85), there is no evidence to substantiate his\nassertion that someone else may have used his computer to gain unauthorized access\nto pornography at work. AG \u00b6 40(e), \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other\ninformation technology system,\u201d applies. \nThere is no evidence of any misuse of a work computer by Applicant since he\nstarted with his present employer in mid-2005. Yet, I am unable to fully apply AG \u00b6\n41(a),  \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under\nunusual circumstances, such that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant testified that after\nhe was counseled about using a government computer to access a pornographic\nwebsite in 2002, he was \u201cpretty much scared straight.\u201d (Tr. 81-82). But the results of the\nforensic investigation of his work computer in late 2004 show this was not the case.\nConsiderable judgment concerns persist because of his unwillingness to accept\nresponsibility for his misuse of the government computer. Concerning his access to\npornography through his work computer in and before 2002, Applicant blamed the lack\nof specific prohibitions (\u201cI may have but then again, there were certainly times in my\nhistory, employment history, where that wasn\u2019t necessarily against the rules because\nthere weren\u2019t any.\u201d Tr. 48). When asked whether he accessed pornography at work in\n2004, Applicant responded, \u201cI may have, I may not have.\u201d (Tr. 53). Applicant may not\nnow be able to recall each instance, but he certainly knew whether or not he had\naccessed adult material on his work computer. His credibility is undermined by such\nequivocation, and by his suggestion that if he accessed pornography, it was\nunintentional:\nI clearly know the difference between a classified system and an\nunclassified system, the data access and work-related activities, the two\nhave never mingled. This was an unclassified system, an unclassified\nnetwork with no real firewall protection whatsoever, so there were, may\nhave been, I should say, instances where adult oriented material may\nhave been viewed unintentionally. I\u2019m not really going to say that in my\nactivities but certainly it\u2019s certainly possible (Tr. 86).\nApplicant had been counseled in the past about viewing adult oriented content on his\nwork computer, and he had recently completed training that advised against\ninappropriate use of the work computer. Applicant knew or should have known to use\nhis government computer for official purposes, and his claim of inadvertent access is\nnot persuasive. AG \u00b6 41(c), \u201cthe conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was\n\n8\nfollowed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of\nsupervisor,\u201d does not apply.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant was interviewed on February 1, 2007, about possible misuse of\na government computer system, he told the government investigator that he had\ndownloaded batch files while on temporary duty in the summer of 2004 that\nunbeknownst to him contained files with adult images. As for the subsequent seizure of\nhis computer, Applicant explained that he learned from his supervisor that inappropriate\nmaterial had been found on his hard drive. After he explained what had happened while\nhe was on temporary duty that summer, he heard nothing more about it and was not\ndisciplined. He denied any intentional violation of any procedures regarding the use of\ncomputer systems, any introduction of unauthorized hardware, software, or media, into\nany information technology systems, or that he ever viewed pornography online. His\ndenial of ever having viewed adult-oriented material via the Internet was false, and\nformed the basis for the government\u2019s recent amendment to the SOR. Applicant\nmaintains that he understood the context of the question to be limited to whether he had\nviewed adult material at his present place of employment:\nThe investigator did not ask me any questions regarding my Internet\naccess at [government employer] and there are two reasons for that,\neither a: [government employer] had said so and he felt that that [sic] was\nnot pertinent to his investigation or [government employer] themselves did\nnot say so and did not inform the investigator and he didn\u2019t talk about that.\nSo as we got later on in the interview and the investigation, we talked\nmore about present tense circumstances, so I thought the question was in\nrelation to my current employment with [company X], which had been\nseveral years in.(Tr. 75).\nAs discussed under Guideline M, supra, there is no evidence that Applicant ever\naccessed pornography at work since he started his present job in mid-2005. But while\nthe investigator\u2019s report does not contain the specific questions asked of Applicant, it\nincludes unequivocal denials by Applicant concerning whether he had ever given\nanyone unauthorized access, ever introduced any unauthorized hardware, software, or\nmedia into any information technology system, or ever viewed pornography online.\n\n9\nApplicant confirmed the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s report of his interview, and in that\nreport it states, \u201cHE HAS NEVER VIEWED PORNOGRAPHY ONLINE.\u201d No one reading\nthe report of the interview would have any reason to know that Applicant\u2019s misuse of a\ngovernment computer involved other than the inadvertent downloading of adult material\nwhile he was on temporary duty in 2004. His claim that it was a good faith mistake\nrelated to the scope of the inquiry is implausible, particularly in light of the fact that he\nhad been counseled for inappropriate access in 2002. A finding of intentional\nconcealment is reasonable based on the investigator\u2019s report, Applicant\u2019s suspect\ncredibility regarding the issue of access to Internet pornography, and his confirmation of\nthe accuracy of the investigator\u2019s report in August 2007. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s misuse of a government information system raises judgment and\nreliability concerns (see AG \u00b6 15) and is a \u201csignificant misuse of Government or other\nemployer\u2019s time or resources\u201d (see AG \u00b6 16(d)(4), \u201ccredible adverse information that is\nnot explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (4) evidence of\nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources.\u201d). However, it\nwas not alleged under Guideline E, and AG \u00b6 16(d)(4) would not apply since the misuse\nof a government computer system is explicitly covered under \u00b6 39, infra.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to be up-front about his knowing misuse of the government-\nowned information system is not mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a), which requires that the\neffort at rectification be prompt, in good faith, and before confrontation (\u201cthe individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts\u201d). Applicant\u2019s employer, then the federal\ngovernment, did not learn of Applicant\u2019s inappropriate web access from him. Applicant\nhad the opportunity to candidly address this during his interview and instead denied he\nhad ever accessed pornography online. At his hearing in late May 2009, he testified\nequivocally about whether he had viewed inappropriate adult material on his\ngovernment computer. Even though more than four years have passed since\nApplicant\u2019s unauthorized use of a government information technology system, his\nviolation of his fiduciary obligation of complete candor is recent and serious. AG \u00b6 17(c),\n\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent,\nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is not\npertinent.  At this point, the government is not yet fully aware of the circumstances or\nextent of his misuse of the government information system. He has shown little to no\n\n10\nappreciation for the seriousness of his trust violations, so AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur,\u201d also does not apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant has raised considerable concerns about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness through his misuse of a government information technology system from\nat least 2002 to late 2004, and by dodging the obligation of full candor required of him\nby virtue of his top secret clearance. He has shown some corrective action in that he\nhas not used a computer to access a pornographic website at work in more than four\nyears, but it is not enough to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has not\nalways been the \u201cgood steward\u201d (Tr. 86) of the government\u2019s trust. He has yet to\nunderstand the security implications of, and take responsibility for, his repeated misuse\nof a government information technology system.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b pertain to the same conduct. The results of the investigation are reported in SOR\n4\n\u00b6 1.b and do not represent conduct of additional security concern.\n11\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant4\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nKathleen E. Voelker, Esq.\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 10, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\n\u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\n1\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation;\u201d Directive, Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 26(b).\n2\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn October 31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Christopher Graham granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Department Counsel raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s\napplication of Guideline H mitigating conditions and his whole-person analysis are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant is 26 years old.  He\nholds a bachelor\u2019s degree and has completed 70% of the requirements for a master\u2019s degree.\nApplicant smoked marijuana 16 times between May 1995 and May 2003, including three times after\nhe received a security clearance in January 2002.  Applicant has not used marijuana since May 2003.\nHe has changed his lifestyle since that time and avoids situations and persons that would bring him\ninto contact with drug use.  Applicant now has a stable relationship with a successful career woman\nand is pursuing an advanced degree.  He is focused on his career and his future.  Applicant expressed\nremorse and stated his intent not to use drugs in the future.  Three character witnesses testified to his\ncharacter and reliability.  \nIn finding favorably for Applicant under Guideline H, the Judge applied \u00b6 26(b) of the\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines in mitigation of the government\u2019s security concerns.   The factual\n1\nfindings above cover three of the mitigating conditions in \u00b6 26(b).  With reference to the \u201cappropriate\nperiod of abstinence,\u201d the Board has not articulated a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d for a required period of\nabstinence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 1999).  In this instance, it was\nnot unreasonable for the Judge to find mitigation after a period of over four years of abstinence. The\nJudge\u2019s conclusions regarding mitigation are consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the record\nevidence and are neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\nLikewise, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is supported by the record evidence.  Examining\nthe Judge\u2019s decision in light of his findings and the record as a whole, the board concludes that he\narticulates \u201ca satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs, Ass\u2019n of the United States v.

We hold that the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision\nis neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\n\n3\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin  \nJean E. Smallin\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E. Moody   \nJames E. Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDissenting Opinion of Jeffrey D. Billett, Board Member\nI respectfully dissent from my colleagues\u2019 decision to affirm the Judge\u2019s decision in this case.\nBecause I believe that the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility assessment of Applicant was flawed, and\nbecause I believe that credibility assessment looms large in the Judge\u2019s ultimate disposition of the\ncase, I vote to remand the case.\nIn the \u201cConclusions\u201d portion of his decision, the Judge offered the following: \u201cApplicant\nlisted his drug use in his security clearance application.  This is positive because candor with the\ngovernment about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person\ndiscloses the adverse information about himself, it supports the notion of trustworthiness.\u201d  A\nreading of the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole indicates that his acceptance of Applicant\u2019s testimony and\nstatements about his regrets concerning his past marijuana use, the adjustments he made to avoid his\npast lifestyle, and his intent not to use drugs in the future were based, to a significant degree, upon\nhis favorable credibility assessment of Applicant.  As the preceding quoted language from the\ndecision indicates, the Judge specifically pointed to the fact that Applicant had been forthright in his\ndisclosure of his past marijuana use when responding to government inquiries about that use.  This\nfinding of forthrightness in turn provided the basis for the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was\nentirely credible and trustworthy.  \nThe Judge\u2019s conclusions notwithstanding, when the detailed evidence in the record is\nconsidered, it indicates that Applicant may have been less than completely forthright when revealing\nhis marijuana use.  On  a 2002 security clearance application, Applicant revealed only marijuana use\nbetween 1995 and 1998.  In a subsequent security clearance application completed in 2006,\nApplicant reveals, for the first time, multiple marijuana uses that took place in 2001.  Additionally,\nApplicant eventually admitted to illegally using marijuana a total of 16 times from 1995 to 2003,\n\n4\nwhile he disclosed only a total of 11 marijuana usages on the two security clearance applications he\nsubmitted and in his answers to interrogatories concerning his drug use.\nThese omissions are more than minor discrepancies, especially in the context of a Judge\u2019s\ndecision that specifically touts Applicant\u2019s credibility based on his truthfulness in revealing his\nmarijuana use to the government.  The objective evidence suggests the real possibility that Applicant\nwas less than truthful with the government, yet the Judge does not mention the omissions or\ndiscrepancies in his decision.  I would remand this case to the Judge and require him to reevaluate\nhis favorable credibility assessment of Applicant in light of the evidence suggesting a lack of candor,\nand then require him to reconsider his overall favorable security clearance decision.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Blank, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 26-year-old software developer employed by a federal contractor  He used\nmarijuana an average of two times per year from 1995 to 2003.  Since then he has a demonstrated\nhis intent not to abuse any drugs in the future by disassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts, changing the environment where drugs were used, and an appropriate period of abstinence.\nHe successfully mitigated the security concerns about drug involvement.  Clearance is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated March 29, 2006).\n1\nTr. at 39.\n2\nId.\n3\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 29, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 10, 2007, detailing the basis\nfor its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the Directive.\nThe President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD\nimplemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive\n5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1,\n2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case\nproceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 23, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 29, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on September 6, 2007.  I convened a hearing on September 28, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security\nclearance.  The government offered two exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-2.  Applicant offered six\nexhibits, marked as Exhibits A-F.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  The government\nfiled one rebuttal exhibit marked as Government Rebuttal Exhibit 1, and without objection it was\nadmitted. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 26-year-old software developer employed by a federal contractor.   He is\n2\nsingle, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in biochemistry and neurobiology/physiology, is about 70%\ncomplete with studies for a master\u2019s degree in systems engineering, has no prior military service, and\nhe has held a security clearance since 2002.3\n\nId. at 49.\n4\nId. at 43.\n5\nId. at 44.\n6\nId. at 44-45.\n7\nId. at 45.\n8\nId. at 45-46, 70-71.\n9\nId. at 19.\n10\nId. at 29-30.\n11\nId. at 33-34.\n12\n3\nApplicant used marijuana, 16 times, from approximately May 1995 until at least May 2003.\nIncluded in this usage was three times use of marijuana after receiving a security clearance in January\n2002.  His marijuana use occurred between the ages of 19 and 27.4\nApplicant has not smoked marijuana since May 2003.   He attributed his use to hanging out\n5\nwith the wrong crowd, and not having the strength of character and self-guidance.   Since May of\n6\n2003, he has followed a solid career path, and maintains a stable relationship with a woman who is\nsuccessful in her own career.  He is now more circumspect about the company he keeps, and avoids\nthis type of conduct.   He is pursuing his advanced degree in systems engineering for the past three\n7\nand one-half years, with a focus on architecture based systems integration.   He moved away from\n8\n(over 100 miles) the environment where his marijuana usage occurred.  He showed remorse, and\nstated his intent to not use drugs in the future.9\nA retired naval officer was Applicant\u2019s supervisor from November 2004 until May 2006.\nApplicant provided reliable, dedicated, full-time, quality work performance for her.  He was\ndependable and never showed any discrepancies associated with being a drug abuser.  She stated that\nhis disclosure of marijuana use on his security clearance application demonstrated his integrity\nbecause in this case, that truthfulness came at great personal cost.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s college friend and roommate from 1999 to 2006 stated that in the social circles\nthey encountered in college, a culture of substance usage existed.  Being friends in college they\nsocialized frequently, and he never saw Applicant smoke marijuana.  He never saw him use\nmarijuana the entire time they lived together.11\nA fellow graduate student who takes the same courses with Applicant stated that as a devout\nMuslim, his religion regards that he should only be friends with people who are honest and just, and\nhe considered Applicant to have these characteristics.  Applicant is a hard worker, and a man of\nintegrity.  As one who holds a security clearance, he believed Applicant possessed the attributes to\nbe trusted with a security clearance.12\n\nGuideline \u00b6 2. \n13\nGuideline \u00b6 2(c).\n14\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).\n15\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n16\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n4\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\n13\nimpartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.14\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n15\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n16\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n17\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence\n18\n.  \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n19\n5\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d   The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\n17\nGovernment.18\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.19\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuidelines \u00b6 24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants,\nand hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction.\nGuidelines \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n\n6\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nThe government established its case under Guideline H (Drug Involvement.)  Applicant\u2019s use\nof marijuana, and  his use of marijuana after being granted a security clearance are the applicable\nDrug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) under Guidelines \u00b6 25 (a) and (g).\nGuidelines \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation;\n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs were\nprescribed, and abuse has since ended; and\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to\nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by\na duly qualified medical professional.\nGuidelines \u00b6 26 (c) and (d) are not applicable.  There is no evidence of abuse of prescription\ndrugs, nor did Applicant attend a prescribed drug treatment program.  Applicant\u2019s stated use of\nmarijuana over an eight year period amounts to two times per year.  That is not evidence of a habitual\nuser.  His last use was 4 \u00bd years ago and since that time, he has demonstrated a more responsible\nattitude about his activities.  He moved away from the city where his drug use occurred.  He has new\nassociates.  He stated his intent not to use drugs in the future.  He is pursuing his master\u2019s degree.\nHe provides competent work for his employer and has maintained a steady relationship with a\nsuccessful woman, all of which indicate maturity.  I believe this conduct is not likely to occur again,\nand does not cast doubt on his current reliability.  He has demonstrated his intent not to use in the\nfuture.  I find Guidelines \u00b6 26 (a) and (b) applicable, and conclude Guideline H for Applicant. \nWhole Person Analysis\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n20\nId.\n21\nId.\n22\n7\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n20\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the\n21\nadjudicative process factors listed in the directive.   \n22\nI considered his age, his education, his employment, and his sporadic drug use.  Applicant\nlisted his drug use in his security clearance application.  This is positive because candor with the\ngovernment about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person\ndiscloses the adverse information about himself, it supports the notion of trustworthiness.  However,\nApplicant needs to understand that illegal use of drugs raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s\nwillingness or ability to protect classified information.  Moreover, impaired ability while under the\ninfluence of marijuana increases the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified material.  Here,\nApplicant has demonstrated a desire to not use drugs in the future.  He has made significant changes\nin his life.\nThe United States has a duty to protect itself from unauthorized disclosures of classified\ninformation and place the utmost trust in those persons to whom it grant access to classified\ninformation.  Applicant has matured, and shown that he can lead a drug-free life.   The totality of the\nrecord raises no reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified\ninformation and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the\ngovernment entrusts its interests.  I base this finding on his credible and sincere testimony.  After\nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context\nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug\ninvolvement.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is granted.\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and has worked for a government contractor since 2002 \nas an office assistant.3 From 1999 to 2002, he was a driver at a warehouse. He \nattended community college from 1999 to 2002 and from 2004 to 2005. He has never \nserved in the military. In September 2002, he received a Secret clearance. He has \nnever been married and does not have any children. \n \nIllegal Drug Use \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), \nand mushrooms (psilocybin) with varying frequency, in about 1997, and then again from \nabout 1999 to at least 2002. He subsequently continued to use these same four drugs \nuntil at least 2004. He used Vicodin without a valid prescription for the expressed \n \n1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated November 14, \n2008; and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated November 20, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit information. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. His response to SOR (Item 3) is the source for the facts in \nthis section unless stated otherwise. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s 2005 SF 86 (Item 5) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated \notherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \npurpose of obtaining a \u201chigh\u201d in at least 1997, and then again from 1999 to at least \n2002. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana about twice a week for the first two years of high \nschool.4 He stopped using marijuana for about two years to improve his school work \nand then resumed his marijuana use the last month of his senior year of high school. \nWhile he was in college, he used marijuana on weekends.  \n \nApplicant began using cocaine, ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), \nmushrooms (psilocybin), and Vicodin approximately every couple of weeks starting at \nthe end of his freshman year in high school. He stopped using these drugs for about two \nyears and then resumed his use of these drugs. He has never had drug treatment or \ncounseling.  \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Applications \n \nApplicant caused his 2002 SF 86 to be submitted on or about June 6, 2002 (Item \n4), and signed his 2005 SF 86 on February 17, 2005 (Item 5). On his 2002 SF 86 he \nresponded, \u201cNo\u201d to question 27. On his 2005 SF 86, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 27 \nand said he used marijuana 5-10 times from March 1997 to July 1997. Question 27 is \nidentical on both the 2002 and 2005 SF 86s. Question 27 asks: \n \n27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\u2014Illegal Use of Drugs \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?    \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to question 27 on his 2002 SF 86 was false. His response \non his 2005 SF 86 provided incomplete information about the extent of his drug use.  He \nexplained to the OPM investigator on December 1, 2006, that he did not disclose his \ndrug use because he really wanted the job and a unnamed person told him not to put \nthe information on his SF 86 (Item 6 at 4). He thought he would not be hired if he \nrevealed his drug use. Id. \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2005 SF 86, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 28 and said he denied \nusing drugs while holding a security clearance. Question 28 asks: \n \n28. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\u2014Use in Sensitive \nPositions Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while \nemployed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; \n \n4 The source for the facts in this and the next paragraph is Applicant\u2019s Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) interview on December 1, 2006, which Applicant adopted as part of the DOHA \ninterrogatory process (Item 6 at 3-5). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwhile possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and \nimmediately affecting public safety? \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to question 28 on his 2005 SF 86 was false because he \nwas issued a Secret clearance on or about September 3, 2002, and his use of illegal \ndrugs or controlled substances continued after he received his Secret clearance until \n2004, as indicated previously.     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant \nused \ncocaine, \necstasy \n(methylenedioxymethamphetamine), \nmushrooms (psilocybin), marijuana and Vicodin (without a prescription) from 1994 to \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n2004.5 He falsely denied this drug use in his response to question 27 on his 2002 SF \n86. His response on his 2005 SF 86 provided incomplete information about the extent of \nhis drug use. He admitted very limited and not recent marijuana use, and did not \ndisclose using cocaine, ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), mushrooms \n(psilocybin), and the prescription drug Vicodin until 2004. He did not disclose drug use \nwhile holding a Secret clearance. His decisions to falsify his 2002 and 2005 security \nclearance applications were intentional and deliberate. The falsifications were intended \nto deceive his employer and security officials. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply.     \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n \n5AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule (Sch.) I controlled \nsubstances. See Sch. I (c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. \n2006) (ecstasy). Mushrooms are the street name for psilocybin or psilocin, which is a Sch. I Controlled \nSubstance. See United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which \nmay contain the Sch. I(c)(15) and I(c)(16) controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). Cocaine is a Sch. \nII Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) do not apply. Applicant did not make a prompt, good-faith \neffort to correct the falsification of his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s before being confronted \nwith the facts. These two falsifications were not caused or significantly contributed to by \nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or \ninstructing him concerning the security clearance process.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. His falsifications of his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s are not \nminor offenses. The 2005 falsification is relatively recent. Because there are two \noffenses, the offenses are not \u201cisolated.\u201d The Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence requires \nconsideration of all such offenses in a non-piecemeal fashion. The Judge is required to \nevaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the \nrecency of his conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). The two falsifications continue \nto caused doubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nBecause of his overall conduct, especially the 2005 falsification of his SF 86, neither of \nthe offenses is mitigated under guideline AG \u00b6 17(c).       \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), 17(e) and 17(g) have some application, but do not apply to a \nsufficient degree to mitigate all security concerns under Guideline E. There are some \npositive signs of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. He admitted his extensive drug use to an \nOPM investigator in his 2006 and 2007 interviews. In June 2008, he adopted the \nsummary of his OPM interview in response to DOHA interrogatories, admitting his \nextensive drug use and falsification of his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s. In August 2008, he \nadmitted his misconduct in response to the SOR. No other allegations of problems at \nhis employment have surfaced. However, he did not indicate he had received drug \ncounseling or other counseling to change his behavior and he did not state that he has \nceased his associations with those persons who used illegal drugs. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) \nand 17(g). He has promised not to use drugs in the future, which is an important step \ntoward his rehabilitation. He received job training and has a good employment record. \nHis security manager is well aware of his drug abuse problems. Disclosure has reduced  \nhis vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his extensive drug use \non his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s. This failure was deliberate, and the allegation of \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nfalsification is substantiated.6 At the time he provided false information, he intended to \ndeceive his employer and security officials. These severe lapses in judgment are too \nrecent and serious to be mitigated at this time.   \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \nApplicant admitted that he knowingly and deliberately failed to disclose \nderogatory information about his drug use on his 2002 SF 86. Because he made limited \nadmissions of marijuana use, not while holding a security clearance, on his 2005 SF 86, \nI infer the failure to disclose the nature and extent of his drug use on his 2005 SF 86 \nwas deliberate and with intent to deceive. For a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur \nby falsifying his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s, the falsification must be material. The Supreme \nCourt defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995), as a \nstatement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the \ndecision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, \n386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    \n \n  \nIf Applicant had provided accurate answers on his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s about \nhis drug use, his accurate answer would be capable of influencing the government to \ndeny his security clearance. The materiality requirement is satisfied. Making a false \nstatement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential \nsentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine).7 In sum, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) \nand 31(c) apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.    \n \n \n6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \n7 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \u2013 31(d) do not fully apply to the two violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  \nAs indicated previously, making a materially and deliberately false statement on an SF \n86 is a felony. The 2005 falsification is somewhat recent. Applicant admitted that in \n2002 he intentionally provided false information to improve his changes of obtaining \nemployment with the government contractor. Both security clearance applications \ncontained deliberately false information and the offenses are established and \nsubstantiated. Because there are two criminal offenses, they are not \u201cisolated.\u201d They \ncontinue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. He was not pressured or coerced into committing the criminal offenses.  \n \nThere is some evidence of successful rehabilitation, including the passage of \nmore than three years since the 2005 falsification of his SF 86. Criminal activity has not \nrecurred. He eventually accepted responsibility for his misconduct. He has received \nsome job training, and no other employment problems have surfaced. However, his \npost-offense behavior is insufficient to fully mitigate the very serious misconduct in this \ncase as described in the SOR. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Appellant \nwas relatively young and immature when he falsified his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s. He \nstopped using illegal drugs in 2004. In 2006, he frankly and candidly admitted his \nextensive history of drug use and admitted that he falsified his 2002 SF 86 to improve \nhis chances of employment with a government contractor. He subsequently admitted his \ndrug use in his response to DOHA interrogatories and his SOR response. He knows the \nconsequences of drug abuse. Appellant contributes to his company and the Department \nof Defense. There is no evidence at work of any other disciplinary problems. There is no \nevidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His \ncharacter and good work performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation and \nmitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to \nretain his employment after his security clearance was called into question in 2006. I am \nsatisfied that if he continues to abstain from drug use, and avoids future offenses he will \nhave future potential for access to classified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a problem with drug abuse for many years. He has not received drug \ncounseling or treatment. However, if his only problem had been his drug abuse, security \nconcerns under the drug involvement guideline would be mitigated by his abstinence \nfrom drug abuse for more than four years because of the passage of time. His \nfalsification of his 2002 and 2005 SF 86s cannot be mitigated at this time. His decisions \nto falsify these critical security documents were knowledgeable, voluntary, and \nintentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. These two \noffenses are felonies and show a lack of judgment and a deliberate failure to abide by \nthe law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001) in the context of security requirements. Such conduct raises \na serious security concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to personal conduct and criminal conduct.     \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n                                            \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on December 1,\n2005. On June 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under criminal conduct\n(Guideline J). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\nApplicant submitted his notarized answer to the SOR on July 13, 2007. He\nelected to have his case decided administratively without a hearing. A copy of the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on November 1, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on\nNovember 7, 2007. Applicant\u2019s six-page response to the FORM was received by DOHA\non December 11, 2007. On January 2, 2008, Department indicated he had no objection\nMarch 12, 2008\n\n2\nto Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission. The first four pages of Applicant\u2019s submission\nare received in the record as AE A, which consists of a personal statement by Applicant\nand three character statements. The two certificates of completion are received in\nevidence as AE B. AE C, the investigator\u2019s record of an interview (three pages in length)\nconducted with Applicant on July 24, 2006, has been admitted in evidence pursuant to\nE3.1.19. of the Directive \u201cto permit the development of a full and complete record.\u201d The\nproblem with AE C is that Applicant confused the arrest dates and/or the details of each\narrest with the subsequent dates he was required to appear in court. Given Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions to all allegations of the SOR, I will rely on the dates cited in the SOR, even\nthough SOR 1.d. is not referenced in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal\nrecord. (GX 5) Based upon a review of the FORM, and Applicant\u2019s response to the\nFORM, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all allegations under the criminal conduct guideline. He noted\nthat if he did not receive a security clearance, the future would not be bright for him.\nMost of the projects of his employer (who he has worked for since December 1997)\nrequire a security clearance. Applicant is 30 years old and has been employed as an\nelectronic technician since December 1997. \nOn August 2, 2002 (SOR 1.a.), Applicant was arrested and charged with inflicting\ncorporal punishment to a spouse/cohabitant, a felony. He admitted the offense, and\nSOR 1.a. was disposed of in SOR 1.d. \nBefore he was arrested for inflicting corporal punishment to a spouse/cohabitant\non August 28, 2002 (SOR 1.b.), Applicant was arguing with his girlfriend about money.\nSuddenly, she made a comment about Applicant and her daughter. He became angry\nand threw his girlfriend against a wall. After seeing a videotape of the incident, showing\nthat his girlfriend started the argument, Applicant claims the district attorney declined to\npress charges. Though SOR 1.b. indicates in the allegation that the case was not\nprosecuted, I do not find Applicant\u2019s videotape explanation credible based on his\nadmitted conduct in throwing his girlfriend against a wall. \nOn November 21, 2002 (SOR 1.c.), Applicant and his girlfriend pushed each\nother during an argument. Applicant left the apartment, and walked down the street.\nWhile walking, he saw a police officer, who coincidentally was in his squad car patrolling\nthe neighborhood. Shortly after telling the officer what had happened, Applicant was\narrested. He contends he was arrested for having admitted he had gotten into a fight\nwith his girlfriend. Applicant surmised that the charges were dismissed after he was\ngiven a form indicating charges would not be pursued. SOR 1.c. indicates the charge\nwas not pursued, but rather disposed of in SOR 1.d.\nOn or about September 2, 2003, Applicant was charged with infliction of corporal\ninjury to a spouse/cohabitant. (SOR 1.d.) The offense occurred on August 28, 2003.\n\n According to AE C, Applicant believed he was sentenced in February 2004.\n1\n No additional details were provided regarding the actual sentence. \n2\n3\nThe charge was amended to include those offenses in SOR 1.a. and 1.c., along with an\nattempted murder charge that does not appear in the 1.d. allegation. \nBefore the arrest on September 2, 2003 (SOR 1.d.), Applicant had returned\nhome at a time when his girlfriend should have been at work. Their ensuing verbal\nargument followed Applicant\u2019s questions to her about being at home and/or being nude.\nShe responded she had been sleeping with other individuals. Even though he told her to\nshut her mouth, she continued to scream. Applicant placed a pillow against her face to\nstop her from screaming, and they both resumed fighting each other. He then left the\nhome and called the domestic violence hot line for information about a place to stay. He\nprovided his home address during the call. While deciding where to stay, Applicant\nreturned home, where the police were waiting to arrest him.\nSOR 1.d. indicates Applicant pled guilty to the first count of inflicting corporal\ninjury to a spouse/cohabitant and count three (SOR 1.a.). The imposition of sentence\n(not disclosed) was suspended, and Applicant was put on probation for three years to\nexpire February 18, 2007. There is no indication of the disposition of count 2. (SOR 1.c.)\nAccording to Applicant, the attempted murder charge was dismissed. \nIn addition to the unknown sentence that was suspended, other very important\nterms of Applicant\u2019s sentence  were not alleged. He was sentenced to 150 hours of\n1\ncommunity service, a $200.00 fine, and participation in 52 weeks of a domestic violence\nprogram. (AE C) Applicant stated in his July 2006 interview that he was considered a\nvaluable member of the domestic violence group. He completed all elements of his\nsentence, including voluntary participation in a 20-hour anger management program.  \nWhile on probation for pleading guilty to the SOR 1.d. offenses, Applicant was\ncharged on June 8, 2004 for infliction of corporal punishment that occurred on June 1,\n2004. (SOR 1.e.) The complainant was again his former girlfriend (same person\nreferred to in SOR 1.a. through 1.d.) that he claimed he had recently broken up with.\nBefore the arrest, Applicant saw his former girlfriend at a trolley stop, and she followed\nhim home. She continued to call him on her cell phone, and he kept telling her the\nrelationship was not working. When he arrived at his house, he called his probation\nofficer, who told him to remain in his house. About an hour later, the police arrested\nApplicant after receiving a call from his former girlfriend. Though he stated he had no\ndirect contact with her, Applicant\u2019s explanation for pleading guilty to the infliction of\ncorporal injury offense was because \u201cit was easier to just plead guilty.\u201d (AE C)\nSOR 1.e. reveals that Applicant pled guilty to the offense of inflicting corporal\ninjury to a spouse/cohabitant. The allegation notes the imposition of sentence  was\n2\nsuspended, and he was placed on three years probation to expire on February 9, 2008.\nThough not included in SOR 1.e. is the 114 hours of community service Applicant\n\n4\nindicates he completed, and the $1,600.00 fine he believes he paid in the spring of\n2006. (AE C) \nApplicant claims he filed a restraining order in July 2004 to stop his former\ngirlfriend from trying to contact him. (AE C) According to Applicant, she violated the\nrestraining order by sending photos to his cell phone. For unexplained reasons, he\nbelieves she was still trying to contact him at the time of his interview in July 2006 (AE\nC), although he had changed his phone number. He provided no documentation in\nsupport of his restraining order claim.\nApplicant\u2019s character evidence comes from his general manager, his facility\nsecurity officer (FSO), and a coworker. The general manager, who has known him for\nnine years and supervised him several times inside this nine year period, admires\nApplicant\u2019s professionalism and team player attitude. The FSO, who has known\nApplicant for 10 years, stated there is no adverse information in Applicant\u2019s file.\nApplicant\u2019s coworker lauded Applicant\u2019s exercise of good judgment over the last six\nyears. AE B contains a certificate of completion awarded to Applicant in June 2005 for\ncompleting the year long domestic violence course. On January 28, 2006, Applicant\nreceived a certificate for completing  20 hours of an anger management course. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines/conditions are applied in conjunction with the nine general\nfactors of the whole person concept. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. The Administrative Judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n5\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-\nthe-clock responsibility. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence\nin individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\nCriminal Conduct\nCriminal behavior creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with the rules. \nAnalysis\nThe SOR identifies five corporal injury offenses that occurred between August\n2002 and June 2004. Applicant admitted the conduct on each occasion. The pattern of\ncriminal conduct falls within the scope of two disqualifying conditions (DC) under the\ncriminal conduct (CC) guideline. CC DC 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) and CC DC 31.d. (individual is currently on probation) apply due to the\nrepeated violations of the law in a two year period, and Applicant\u2019s current probation\nstatus. The criminal conduct is aggravated by his egregious behavior on August 28,\n2003 (SOR 1.d.), in putting a pillow over the victim\u2019s face to stop her from screaming.\nThe fact that the attempted murder charge was dismissed does not eliminate the\nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s underlying conduct. \nEqually disturbing is the fact that Applicant was under the jurisdiction of the SOR\n1.d. court (or on probation by that court) when he was charged a fifth time (for the\ncorporal punishment offense) on June 8, 2004 by the SOR 1.e. court.\nThere are two mitigating conditions (MC) that could dramatically reduce the\nsecurity concerns related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. CC MC 32.a. (so much time\nhas elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) does not apply. Only four years have\ntranspired since Applicant was convicted of infliction of corporal punishment. The\ncriminal behavior was not an isolated offense, but a pattern of conduct that could have\nresulted in the death of his former girlfriend. Assuming he successfully completed all\nterms of probation, it has only been a month since his discharge from the jurisdiction of\nthe court. \n\n6\nWhen an applicant shows evidence of convincing mitigation, then he can take\nadvantage of CC MC 32.d. (there is successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement) to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion. Applicant is entitled to limited\nmitigation under CC MC 32.d. because of the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity. The mitigation must be weighed against the fact Applicant has been\nunder the jurisdiction of the sentencing court for the entire period. He was well aware\nthat a violation of one of the probation terms could mean incarceration pursuant to the\nterms of the original sentence. \nApplicant has provided detailed information regarding the costs incurred as a\nresult of the fines and other direct or indirect fees he has had to pay due his criminal\nactivity. Payment of the fines and other costs weighs in his favor.\nApplicant\u2019s successful completion of the year-long, court-ordered domestic\nviolence program and the voluntary, 20-hour anger management course also count as\nfavorable evidence for him. Missing from Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, however, is\nevidence that demonstrates the benefit, if any, the courses had on Applicant. This\nevidence is critical to Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation. Clearly, the sentencing judge in\nSOR 1.d. recognized a problem and ordered Applicant to seek help through the\ndomestic violence program. I cannot simply assume from Applicant\u2019s certificate of\ncompletion of both courses that he recognizes his domestic violence and anger\nmanagement issues, unless he articulates what his completion of the courses have\nmeant to him. In sum, the mitigating evidence, including favorable job performance\ncompliments provided by his colleagues, is insufficient to overcome the pattern of\ncriminal behavior Applicant engaged in between 2002 and June 2004. Subparagraphs\n1.a. through 1.e. are resolved against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy adverse findings under the CC guideline must still be evaluated in the context\nof whole person concept. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is aggravated by the fact it\noccurred five times in less than two years. Even though SOR 1.d. was not prosecuted,\nhe admitted throwing his former girlfriend against a wall in 2002. In 2003, he put a pillow\nover his face. While he was under the jurisdiction of the Court (probation) in SOR 1.d.,\nhe committed the same offense in June 2004 (SOR 1.e.), and the judge extended his\nprobation one year to February 2008. Though Applicant has not violated the law since\n2004, and he has completed a year-long court-ordered program, and a voluntary anger\nmanagement program, he has not provided any information about the content of either\ncourse, specifically what he learned about effectively dealing with domestic altercations\nand controlling his anger. Without this probative evidence, I cannot conclude with\ncomplete confidence this conduct will not recur. The CC guideline is found against\nApplicant.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nGwendolyn F. Stokes, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant admitted soliciting prostitutes on numerous occasions between 1992 and 1996.\nIn January 1994 and July 1996, he pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitutes.  In January 2006, he was\ncited for soliciting a known prostitute, but the charges were dismissed.  His wife is unaware of his\nrecord of soliciting prostitutes.  Security concerns based on criminal conduct, sexual behavior, and\npersonal conduct are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on October 3, 2006.  On July 13, 2007, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\nfor its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and\nmodified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\neffective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal\nConduct), D (Sexual Behavior), and E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 7, 2007, admitted some allegations and\ndenied some, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on October 10, 2007, and heard\nas scheduled on November 14, 2007.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 21, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nOn October 3, 2007, Department Counsel filed a motion to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6\u00b6 2.b,\n2.c, and 2.d under Guideline D, cross-alleging  the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c\nunder Guideline J as sexual conduct under Guideline D.  At the hearing, Applicant did not object to\nthe amendments, and I granted the motion (Tr. 11).  Applicant had not responded in writing to the\nmotion to amend, but at the hearing he admitted \u00b6 2.b as amended, and he denied \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d as\namended.\nAlthough the parties orally agreed in late October to the hearing date of November 14, 2007,\nthe written hearing notice was dispatched on November 1, 2007, less than the 15 days required by\nthe Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8.  Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement (Hearing Exhibit I; Tr. 13).\nOn motion of Department Counsel and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of the provisions of the city code pertaining to prostitution in the city where\nthe alleged conduct occurred (Hearing Exhibit II; Tr. 21-23).\nGovernment Exhibit (GX) 2 consisted of DOHA interrogatories, Applicant\u2019s responses, and\na 4-page extract from a report of investigation summarizing Applicant\u2019s oral statement to a security\ninvestigator.  Applicant pointed out several minor errors in the summarization in his response to the\ninterrogatories (GX 2 at 3) and at the hearing (Tr. 90-92).  Department Counsel did not offer an\nauthenticating witness for report of investigation attached to GX 2, as required by Directive \u00b6\nE3.8.20.  Applicant\u2019s counsel questioned whether two police reports offered by Department Counsel\n(GX 3 and 4) were inadmissible because they were \u201cinvestigative reports,\u201d but she made no\nfoundational objection to GX 2 (Tr. 24-29).  I conclude that the lack of an authenticating witness for\nthe attachment to GX 2 was waived by the failure of Applicant\u2019s counsel to object.\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old cable installer for a defense contractor (Tr. 37).  He was hired in\nOctober 2006 and given an interim clearance.  His interim clearance was revoked when DOHA made\nthe preliminary determination to deny him a clearance (Tr. 38-41).  At the time of his hearing, he was\nworking as an auto detailer (Tr. 36).  If his clearance is granted, he will return to his job as a cable\ninstaller (Tr. 117).\nApplicant was married in June 1988, and his daughter was born in 1992.  After the birth of\nhis daughter, his wife became increasingly unwilling to engage in sexual activity (Tr. 71-72).  He\nand his wife attended marriage counseling from about November 2001 to September 2002, but his\nwife participated \u201con her own terms,\u201d not participating in counseling sessions dealing with sexual\nintimacy (Tr. 73-74).  Applicant has remained married even though the sexual intimacy issues have\nnot been resolved, because he still loves his wife (Tr. 76-77).\nIn January 1994, Applicant picked up a woman who waved at him while he was driving past,\nand they agreed she would perform oral sex on him.  The police arrested Applicant before any sex\nacts occurred.  Applicant pleaded guilty to attempting to solicit a prostitute, paid a $150 fine, and\nwas placed on probation for one year (GX 2 at 8).  At the hearing, he testified the charges ultimately\nwere dismissed (Tr. 57).\nIn July 1996, Applicant met a woman near a motel in the same area as the January 1994\nincident.  They went to a motel room and Applicant asked the woman to perform oral sex on him.\nThe woman was an undercover police officer.  Applicant was cited for soliciting a prostitute.  He\npleaded guilty, paid a fine of $100, and was placed on probation for one year (GX 2 at 8; GX 3).  At\nthe hearing, Applicant admitted he pleaded guilty and was convicted, and he admitted telling a\nsecurity investigator he was fined \u201c$100 or $150\" and was placed on probation, but at the hearing\nhe testified he was unsure of the disposition of the charge (Tr. 55, 117-18).\nIn January 2006, Applicant picked up a woman who waved at him as he drove past, in the\nsame area as the two previous incidents.  The woman was a known prostitute.  No conversation\nabout sex and no sexual acts occurred.  After Applicant drove 2-3 blocks, he was stopped by the\npolice and cited for soliciting a known prostitute (GX 4).  Applicant testified the woman asked him\nfor a ride for a distance of 2-3 blocks, and he was pulling over to let her out when the police\nconfronted him.  He insisted he was not looking for sexual activity, but he admitted he exercised bad\njudgment by picking up a stranger in that area (Tr. 103-05).  The charge was dismissed for lack of\nevidence (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nIn an interview with a security investigator on December 18, 2006, Applicant admitted the\nincidents described above.  He also admitted hiring approximately 24 prostitutes between 1990 and\n1996.  He explained that he sought out prostitutes because his wife is sexually anorexic and\nwithholds sexual relations from him (GX 2 at 9).  At the hearing, he testified that in retrospect he\nhad overestimated the number of times he sought out prostitutes, and that it was more likely about\n16 times instead of 24 and for a shorter period, from 1992 to 1996 (Tr. 60-61).\n\n4\nApplicant has not told his wife or his teenaged daughter about his activities with prostitutes.\nHe feels guilty and remorseful about his conduct.  He also believes telling his wife about his conduct\nwould be a \u201clow blow,\u201d hitting her where she hurts the most (Tr. 80-81).  In an effort to avoid\nreverting to his previous behavior, he is involved with a \u201cmen\u2019s accountability group,\u201d and he\nengages in prayer and devotionals nearly daily (Tr. 107-08).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n\n5\nThe SOR alleges Applicant was cited for prostitution in January 2006 but the charge was\ndismissed (\u00b6 1.a).  It also alleges he was charged with prostitution-related offenses in June 1996 and\nJanuary 1994, and he pleaded guilty to the charges (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c). \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  AG \u00b6 30.  Conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d and an \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d  AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  Applicant\u2019s conduct in\nJanuary 2006 apparently was interrupted by the police before any criminal conduct occurred.  I\nconclude he refuted the allegation of criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  However, his pleas of guilty\nto attempting to solicit a prostitute in January 1994, and soliciting a prostitute in July 1996 are\nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 32(a).  Applicant\u2019s last criminal act was in July 1996, more than 10 years ago.  His\nconduct in January 2006 exhibited bad judgment but did not reach the level of criminal conduct.  The\nfirst prong (\u201cso much time\u201d) is established.  However, the second prong (\u201cunusual circumstances\u201d)\nis not established because Applicant\u2019s marital difficulties relating to sexual intimacy continue to\nexist.  The third prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s . . . good judgment\u201d) also is not\nestablished, because his repeated encounters with prostitutes cast doubt on his good judgment.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record,\nor constructive community involvement.\u201d  AG \u00b6 32(d).  Although more than 10 years have passed\nsince Applicant\u2019s last criminal conviction for involvement with prostitutes, his contact with a\nprostitute in January 2006, coupled with his implausible explanation for his conduct, strongly\nsuggests he was contemplating sexual activity when he invited the woman into his car.  His conduct\nand his implausible explanation are sufficiently troublesome to raise doubt about his successful\nrehabilitation.  I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is not established.\n\n6\nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior)\nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant solicited approximately 24 prostitutes between 1990 and 1996.\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d allege the same conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c.  The concern\nunder this guideline is that \u201c[s]exual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality\nor emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the individual\nto undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201csexual\nbehavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d  AG \u00b6 13(a).\nApplicant admitted he engaged the services of prostitutes on numerous occasions between either\n1990 (as admitted to a security investigator and in his answer to the SOR) or 1992 (as admitted at\nthe hearing) and 1996.  His conduct violated the local law prohibiting soliciting or patronizing\nprostitutes (Hearing Exhibit II).  He pleaded guilty to attempting to solicit a prostitute in January\n1994 and soliciting a prostitute in July 1996.  I conclude AG \u00b6 13(a) is raised.  \nSecurity concerns also may be raised by \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  AG \u00b6 13(c).  Applicant concealed his conduct from\nhis family to avoid causing them distress, and he admitted at the hearing that knowledge of his\nconduct would be very painful to them.  I conclude this disqualifying condition is raised.\nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be raised by \u201csexual behavior of a public\nnature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 13(d).  While Applicant\u2019s conduct\nwas not \u201cpublic,\u201d it clearly reflects lack of good judgment.  I conclude this disqualifying condition\nis raised.\nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long\nago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b614(b).\nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago) is established.  Even though the evidence suggests Applicant may have\nbeen contemplating sexual activity when he was detained and cited in January 2006, the evidence\nalso indicates the police intervened before any sexual activity occurred.  Thus, the last incident of\nsexual behavior was in 1996, more than 10 years ago.  The second prong (\u201cso infrequently\u201d) is not\nestablished in light of Applicant\u2019s admission of multiple transactions with prostitutes.  The third\nprong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) also is not established.  Although no sexual activity occurred in January\n2006, the evidence strongly suggests Applicant was contemplating it.  The motivation for previous\nsexual activity, i.e., his wife\u2019s rejection of sexual intimacy, continues to exist.  Finally, Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of sexual activity with prostitutes and his conduct in January 2006 cast doubt on his good\njudgment.  Based on all the evidence, I conclude AG \u00b6 14(b) is not established.\nSecurity concerns arising from sexual behavior also may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  AG \u00b6 14(c).  Applicant\u2019s\nwife and teenaged daughter are unaware of his long record of soliciting prostitutes.  His testimony\nduring the hearing, and his demeanor while testifying, made it clear that disclosure of his sexual\nconduct to his wife and family would be painful for him.  I conclude AG \u00b6 14(c) is not established.\n\n7\nFinally, security concerns based on sexual behavior may be mitigated by showing it was\n\u201cstrictly private, consensual, and discreet.\u201d  AG \u00b6 14(d).  While Applicant\u2019s conduct may have been\nstrictly private and consensual, he routinely solicited total strangers, including an undercover police\nofficer on one occasion.  His conduct was indiscriminate and clearly not discreet.  I conclude AG \u00b6\n14(d) is not established.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b allege Applicant\u2019s wife was not aware of the conduct alleged under\nGuidelines J and D above. The concern under this guideline is: \u201cConduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  AG \u00b6 15.  A disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment\nof information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15(e).  This condition is raised by evidence Applicant\nconcealed his dealings with prostitutes from his wife in order to avoid inflicting emotional pain on\nher.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged\nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate\nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(d).  Applicant has acknowledged his\nbehavior, expressed remorse, attended marriage counseling, and is currently involved in a support\ngroup.  However, the main stressor, i.e., his sexually dysfunctional marriage, remains unresolved.\nHis conduct in January 2006 raises doubt whether his dealings with prostitutes are \u201cunlikely to\nrecur.\u201d  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken\npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n17(e).  Applicant has taken positive steps to change his behavior, but he continues to conceal his\nsexual conduct from his wife.  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(e) is not established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  \nApplicant is a mature adult.  In spite of their difficulties, he remains devoted to his wife.  He\nhas taken significant measures to break away from habit of consorting with prostitutes, but his recent\n\n8\nconduct raises doubt whether it will not recur.  He remains vulnerable to pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, D, and E, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns based on criminal conduct, sexual conduct, and personal conduct.\nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline D (Sexual Behavior):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 42-year-old research scientist employed by a defense contractor. He has never held a clearance. Applicant is a native of Taiwan. He graduated from college in Taiwan in 1987, served two years of mandatory military service in the Taiwanese Army, and came to the U.S. on a student visa in 1990 to complete his education (Tr. 35, 42). He obtained a master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, spent about a year in postdoctoral studies, and then went to work for his current employer in February 1998 (Tr. 44).

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nAlison O\u2019Connell, Esq., Department Counsel\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in Taiwan, and his wife was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC).  Both came to the U.S. on student visas in the 1990s and both recently became U.S. citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and three siblings are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  His mother-in-law and\nfather-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Security concerns based on foreign influence\nare not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 30, 2007, admitted all the factual allegations,\noffered explanations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2007, and\nheard as scheduled on September 18, 2007.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 26,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 42-year-old research scientist employed by a defense contractor.  He has never\nheld a clearance.\nApplicant is a native of Taiwan.  He graduated from college in Taiwan in 1987, served two\nyears of mandatory military service in the Taiwanese Army, and came to the U.S. on a student visa\nin 1990 to complete his education (Tr. 35, 42). He obtained a master\u2019s degree in aerospace\nengineering and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, spent about a year in postdoctoral studies, and\nthen went to work for his current employer in February 1998 (Tr. 44).  He became a U.S. citizen in\nJanuary 2006.\nApplicant met his wife while they were both students in the U.S. (Tr. 35-36).  His wife, then\na citizen of the PRC, entered the U.S. on a student visa in August 1991 and recently became a U.S.\ncitizen (Tr. 47).  They were married in February 1995.  She is employed by a private company as a\nsoftware engineer (Tr. 49). Applicant and his wife have two children, ages 11 and 6.  Both are\nnative-born U.S. citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother, and three sisters are citizens and residents of Taiwan.\nApplicant\u2019s father is about 72 years old and owns a bicycle store.  His mother, about 70 years old,\nworks in the bicycle store (Tr. 50).  Neither parent has ever worked for the Taiwanese government.\nApplicant contacts his parents at least twice a month.  He gives about $2,000 each year to his\nsiblings to purchase gifts for their parents in accordance with Taiwanese tradition (Tr. 39).  He\n\nThe SOR alleged Applicant traveled to Taiwan in June 2006.  At Department Counsel\u2019s request, I amended\n1\nthe SOR to conform to the evidence by alleging he traveled in June 2005 (Tr. 20).\n3\ntraveled to Taiwan to visit his parents and siblings in June 2005,  July 2006, and November 2003,\n1\naccompanied by his wife and children.  His parents visit him in the U.S. every two or three years,\nmost recently in June 2007 (Tr. 57-59).\nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is a 50-year-old nun (Tr. 61-62).  He talks to her telephonically about\ntwice a year, and visits her when he visits his parents (Tr. 63-64).  \nApplicant\u2019s next younger sister is about 45 years old, works as a software engineer in\nTaiwan, and has applied for immigration to Canada (Tr. 64-65).  She is married and has three\nchildren.  She works for a company that previously was government-owned but now is a private\ncompany (Tr. 66).  He contacts her by telephone about once a year (Tr. 67).\nApplicant\u2019s youngest sister is about 43 years old, and she works part-time for a research\ninstitute in Taiwan.  She is disabled and works at home on the internet, performing human resources\nduties for the institute.  She does not participate in research (Tr. 68-69).  They speak on the telephone\nonly once or twice a year but use text messaging and a website camera weekly (Tr. 71).\nApplicant\u2019s brother is about 40 years old and works as a software consultant, sometimes for\nprivate companies and sometimes for the Taiwanese government (Tr. 73).  He talks to his brother\ntelephonically about once a year and contacts him by text message about three times a year (Tr. 74).\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC.  They are\nboth in their 70s, and they retired before Applicant and his wife were married (Tr. 77).  His father-in-\nlaw previously worked for an aerospace institute and his mother-in-law was an accounting assistant.\nApplicant talks to his in-laws telephonically less than once a year (Tr. 79).  His wife talks to her\nparents every one or two months (Tr. 80).  They came to the U.S. for Applicant\u2019s wedding in 1995,\nvisited for about six months in 2000 when Applicant\u2019s daughter was born, and made a third six-\nmonth visit two or three years ago (Tr. 79-81).  In 2002, Applicant and his family visited his in-laws\nin the PRC for about 10 days (Tr. 82).\nApplicant testified he loves his parents, but his family is in the U.S.  He testified he\ndemonstrated his independence from the influence of his parents by marrying a citizen of the PRC,\nregarded by his parents as an enemy of Taiwan, and his wife demonstrated her independence by\nmarrying a citizen of Taiwan, regarded as an enemy by her parents (Tr. 37).  He believes that\nanything that is harmful to the U.S. is harmful to his children (Tr. 38).\nApplicant maintains contact with a college friend in Taiwan.  They were close friends in\ncollege, but now their contact is limited to an annual greeting card and occasional telephone call (Tr.\n84-85; GX 2 at 14).\nAt the request of Department Counsel, and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of relevant facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan (Tr.\n29-30).  Department Counsel\u2019s request is included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.\n\n4\nThe PRC has an authoritarian government dominated by the Communist Party.  It has large\nand increasingly sophisticated military forces.  The U.S. and the PRC have been rivals since the Cold\nWar, with particular disagreement on the status of Taiwan.  Despite political disagreements, the U.S.\nand the PRC have become major economic and trading partners.  The PRC aggressively targets\nsensitive and protected U.S. technology and military information, using worldwide intelligence\noperations, including those in Taiwan.  It is one of the most aggressive practitioners of industrial\nespionage.  There are an estimated 2,000-3,000 PRC-front companies operating in the U.S. to gather\nsecret or proprietary information.  U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence\ntargets.  \nThe PRC has a poor human rights record.  It suppresses political dissent and engages in\narbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners.  Travelers\nto the PRC can expect to be placed under surveillance, with their hotel rooms, telephones, and fax\nmachines monitored and personal possessions, including computers, searched without their\nknowledge or consent.\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy, established as a separate, independent government by\nrefugees from mainland China in 1949.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) does not recognize\nTaiwan\u2019s independence and insists there is only one China.  The U.S. recognized Taiwan as an\nindependent government until January 1979, when it formally recognized the PRC government as\nthe sole legal government of China and terminated its mutual defense treaty with Taiwan (HX I,\nEnclosure VIII at 9).  Taiwan maintains a large military establishment to protect itself from the PRC\nand purchases defensive military equipment from the U.S.  Taiwan is among the most active\ncollectors of U.S. economic intelligence.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\n\n5\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a). A security concern also may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d).  The totality\nof an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be\nconsidered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\n\n6\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are not connected with the Taiwanese government or the military.  Their\nbicycle shop is not a high technology business likely to be a vehicle for industrial espionage.\nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is a nun, unconnected to government, the military, or business.  Applicant\u2019s\nmiddle sister works for a government institute, but she works at home and her duties are limited to\npersonnel administration.  Applicant\u2019s connection with an old college friend appears to have\nwithered to a casual social connection.  On the other hand, his brother and middle sister are\nemployed in high technology businesses susceptible to involvement in industrial espionage or being\ntargeted and used as a conduit for espionage activities.\nTaiwan is a close ally, friend, and trading partner of the U.S.  The nature of Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment, its human rights record, and its relationship with the U.S. are clearly not determinative.\nNevertheless, they are all relevant factors in determining whether Taiwan would risk damaging its\nrelationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order to force a U.S.\ncitizen to betray the U.S. \nApplicant has little direct contact with his in-laws in the PRC, but his wife has regular\ncontact.  \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to,\nthe immediate family members of the person's spouse.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA\nLEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  His in-laws attended his wedding and have visited twice\nin the U.S., both times for about six months, and Applicant has visited his in-laws in the PRC once.\nWhile there is sparse evidence showing personal affection for his in-laws, he has not rebutted the\npresumption that he has ties of obligation to them.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law was employed in the aerospace business.  The PRC aggressively\ntargets U.S. technology, focusing on U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry.  Although it is likely\nApplicant and his wife would resist overt attempts to influence them, there is a \u201cheightened risk\u201d that\nthey could be targeted by more subtle, indirect means.  \nSome of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan, considered individually, do not present the\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(a).  However, the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan and the PRC are\nsufficient to raise both AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(d).\nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Applicant\u2019s ties to two of his siblings\nin Taiwan and his in-laws in the PRC raise the \u201cpotential conflict of interest\u201d contemplated by this\ndisqualifying condition.\n\n7\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the\nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden\nof disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  While Applicant\u2019s parents and oldest sister\n(the nun) are in situations in Taiwan where a conflict of interest would be unlikely, his middle sister\nand brother in Taiwan and his in-laws in the PRC present a likelihood of a conflict of interest.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan and the PRC in totality, I conclude the mitigating condition\nin AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to his college\nfriend is minimal, but it is strong for his parents, siblings, and in-laws.  Although he and his wife\nhave lived in the U.S. since the early 1990s, they only recently became U.S. citizens. Applicant has\nthe burden of establishing a mitigating condition, and he has not met his burden for AG \u00b6 8(b).\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(c).  Applicant has established this\nmitigating condition for his college friend, but not for his family members and in-laws.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult whose family aspirations are in and with the U.S.  He has\nmitigated the security concerns based on his ties to his parents, two of his sisters, and a college\nfriend, but he is vulnerable to subtle exploitation by or through his other siblings. His wife is\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress exercised directly against her or indirectly through her\nparents in the PRC.  Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan and the PRC, considered in their totality, make him\nvulnerable to direct or indirect coercion or exploitation, notwithstanding his loyalty to the U.S.\n\n8\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden\nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B (Foreign Influence):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",
